"This app is meh. It gets the job done - basic reminders and such, great categorization of meds and tracking pill counters, refill reminders and whatever. However, sometimes I take my meds and don't have my phone on me immediately so when I log the time, it's usually several hours off and then messes up my daily dosage because it throws off my reminders. Developers, please make the scrolling times available to edit the time medicine was taken. It has the option, but once released it defaults back to the current time. Fix that and I'll give this app a 5-star any day.",Information
