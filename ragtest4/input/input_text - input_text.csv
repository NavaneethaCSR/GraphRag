1,"Unlike Next, which we'd eaten at the previous night, where each dish is completely recognizable but notable for being the best possible incarnation of itself, Alinea delivers a meal created by Willy Wonka, with all the rules thrown out the window. I won't recount every course, just highlight the dishes that made me laugh, or let me know this was a restaurant like no other, a place where there were no rules that had to be followed, a sanctuary which allowed a chef freedom to go wherever imagination led. For example, while the beverage choices were explained, six bowls containing blocks of ice resting on beds of pebbles were placed on the table, without a word being said about what they were for. Each block had a hole drilled in the center, and once we'd made our decisions about what we'd be drinking, servers then came to the table with glass straws filled with steelhead roe in a liquid and stoppered at either end with foam. We were instructed to take our straws, fit them into the perfectly sized hole, now filled with ice melt, and inhale the mixture in a single slurp as quickly and as loudly as we could. The frigid rush of roe and herbs and peach (I'm unsure whether that fruit flavor came from the straw or the melt) was sweet and salty and made us giggle, a perfect start to the most unusual meal of my life. For Lamb 86, we were each presented with a narrow plate containing three perfect pieces of lamb, each prepared in a different manner, and two plexiglas shields were placed in the center of the table, each with 86 different garnishes, none of them identified, but all, we were promised, fitting accompaniments to the lamb. I cut the three tender servings into three smaller pieces so I could experience more of the flavor combinations, and the table turned into a guessing game as we each plucked the sides that tempted us and tried to identify what we'd chosen. Not every course was as unusual in its presentation as that. Some courses astonished with their perfection alone. Hot Potato, Cold Potato, which we were told was one of the oldest courses that still remained on the Alinea menu, consisted of a paraffin bowl filled with cold potato soup, while a hot potato and a piece of truffle were held aloft by a skewer which went through the lip of the bowl. We were to pull the pin, and the moment the two ingredients met, we were to toss it back, so the soup had no time to warm, the potato no time to chill, and the two flavors and temperatures only came together on the tongue. Then there was the Black Truffle Explosion, which was served on a spoon, and to be chewed with closed lips, so none of the delectable juice escaped. These awed not by the science fictional nature of their presentations, but from the precise combination of their ingredients, eaten at exactly the right moment. One course that makes clear why a dish must be eaten when served is the green apple helium balloon, which if not ingested upon delivery, would, I fear, end up collapsing upon itself before eaten. The skin of the balloon as well as the string with which we held it were both made of apply taffy, and we were told to press our lips against the balloon, take a bite, and inhale. My mouth filled immediately with the intense flavor of apple--and with helium as well, of course--so we were all soon talking about how amazing it tasted while sounding like Mickey and Minnie Mouse. For our final course, the table was cleared, and we were asked to lift our glasses as a silicone covering was rolled out. Servers then brought many small bowls, two metal jugs sweating with condensation, and three white globes with circular holes in their tops. Then two chefs arrived, and began spooning out the contents of the bowls onto the table, scattering them like culinary Jackson Pollacks as they identified each--freeze-dried strawberry, English pea, buttermilk cream, and so on. Then the chefs each lifted a jug and announced, ""liquid nitrogen,"" and poured the contents into the white globes, which caused a fog to rise and cover the table. Finally, the chefs lifted the globes, which were made of white chocolate, and smashed them upon the table, revealing the goodies within--meringues, cotton candy, miniature jelly donuts, condensed honeydew melon, and more. After which we took our spoons and attacked, not making as much of a dent as the creation deserved. At meal's end, we stepped out of the restaurant ... four hours and thirty-nine minutes after we had arrived. Yes. The meal took four hours and thirty-nine minutes. But I assure you that it did not feel as if that much time had passed, because ... oh, I'm going to go into cliche mode now, but you know how it's sometimes said that time stood still? Well, time didn't stand still, per se, but ... let's just say that while we were in Alinea, it didn't exist. We were outside of time, in a pocket universe all to ourselves."
2,Probably one of the best meals I've had ever. It's a performance of what food can be. Having Grant Achatz prepare our dessert was amazing and getting a tour of the kitchen and prep areas downstairs by him personally was even better. Be prepared for an evening and come prepared to sit for a least 4 hours or more. One word to describe it = Awesome!!!

5,"Service was impeccable. Experience and presentation was cool. Eating a balloon was fun. Trying to make a reservation was ridiculous. Food was not mouth watering, tasted like it it was made in a lab. I appreciate delicious food, so I don't get the hype here."
6,"The problem with places like this, given the exhorbitant cost, media attention, and stellar reviews, is that the bar is set so high, it's nearly impossible to meet those expectations. To set expectations, the meal, including wine pairing, totaled $564 per person in our party of 6. Now, I'm no stranger to spending a lot on fine dining- The French Laundry, Benu, Daniel, Cyrus, and the Bazaar were all extravagant and decadent dining experiences I've been fortunate to enough to try. I felt each of them offered something in the way of transcendent flavors, over the top service, and/or that little something extra to justify the value proposition. All in all, I felt Alinea failed to provide that value. Were the dishes innovative and unique? Yes. Was presentation whimsical, playful, and imaginative? Yes. Was service attentive and informed? Yes. However, was the experience as a whole better than others in this class? No. Was it worth it? NO. Maybe this comes down to personal preference. I'm more a fan of precise, classic plating techniques over the Jackson Pollock style presentation I found on most of the dishes here. Dessert was *SPOILER ALERT* served by Grant Achatz himself LITERALLY shattering a filled white chocolate egg all over our (nicely prepared) table. We were then given spoons. I also had issue with the distinct lack of traditional luxury ingredients. I understand the idea behind creative and non-traditional use of ingredients. But for my money, I'd rather have a nice scoop of caviar rather than a crazy, what-am-I-eating composition of discarded corn products (corn silk, corn smut [huitlacoche], and corn husk). Indeed, the waiter rather cheerfuly informed us that yes, in fact, we were eating trash! The myriad rules and regulations were also off-putting. Buy your ticket online. Wear a jacket. Show up 30 minutes prior to your reservation. Eat this dish in 5 seconds before it decomposes in your hands. Despite the whimsy of the dishes, I felt that the place, the whole experience, simply took itself too seriously. In the end, Alinea will be a once in a lifetime experience for me, because I simply can't justify going back."
7,"I have no idea how to write my review - dining at Alinea brings a whole different perspective to food, life and Chicago! I think everyone has a unique experience with the food - ingredients and presentation - but two things I'll highlight about my personal experience are: 1) This was an amazingly vegetarian friendly place for the experience. After you've bought a ticket, they'll call to ask a few days ahead of the reservation about any dietary restrictions and that's when they record vegetarian. I didn't feel that we missed out on even an ounce of the experience that non-vegetarians have. in fact, I admire the kitchen's ability to do such a great job with it! 2) this place is very unique and of course, expensive, but not a single staff member here was pretentious or stiff - they took a lot of pride in what they do but in a natural friendly way (the American way as my dining partner put it). You can be comfortable, natural and just enjoy."
8,"Despite the first-world tragedy I endured in an effort to get reservations (see my first review for details), I did miraculously manage to secure a table for my party of four. The short version: It was whimsical. It was innovative. It was the best meal of my life. The long version: There is a moment of anxiety and excitement before dining at Alinea. You've heard the stories, or maybe you've read up on molecular gastronomy. Then you arrive and the doorman gestures toward a dark, Willy Wonka-esque hallway that gets more narrow with each step. You think you've hit a dead end when, seemingly out of nowhere, a door slides gracefully open. As you gaze upon the host's smiling face, you realize: that moment outside wasn't a moment after all. This feeling is going to last as long as your dining experience does. And so, it begins. Each course will come out, meticulously plated, with an experienced and friendly waiter right beside you, explaining how to eat what's been set forth in front of you. Without giving away too many specifics of the ever-changing menu, I will say you're likely to find yourself sucking up one course through a test tube, kissing another, eating one course without any hands, and another directly off the table. Intrigued? Then I'll continue! Should you choose to do wine pairings with each course, which I strongly recommend, the sommelier will pour you a smorgasbord of varietals, including a few you've probably never heard of before (ie: Zibibbo). With each pour, there will be an accompanying story about where the wine came from, and why the flavors within make it the perfect pairing. Overall: Grant Achatz's progressive style of cuisine is pure genius, and the experience is joyous and genuinely enchanting. For better or worse, I guarantee you will leave with a new perspective on the unbounded future of the culinary arts. I hope to someday return to Chicago and do it all over again! Counsel: ""Like"" Alinea's Facebook page for up-to-date information on when new reservations will be released, same-day dining options, and upcoming projects, such as their forthcoming collaboration with New York's Eleven Madison Park."
9,"Overall, was it worth the hype? Yes and more. Was it worth every penny? Hell yes! Is it a life changing food experience? Yes! Will I be coming back? You bet! Soon? Probably not, it definitely broke the bank and I'd also like to see a different menu. Truly 5-star experience. I was able to snag a 2-top ticket from their new ticketing system, which isn't hard to obtain as long as you follow them on Facebook or twitter and you check fairly regularly. The meal at the end of the day ran me nearly $1000, which I will say without hesitation was the best $1000 I've ever spent. Everything from the food, wine pairing, service (sort of), atmosphere, was everything you paid for and more. They only have a prix-fixe menu of 15-17 items, mostly all of them were excellent. They all emphasized the pure flavors of the ingredients such as the corn as well as the tomato (both fantastic and one our favorites). Other courses emphasized the subtleties and complementary flavors such as the chanterelle (probably our favorite of the evening). Other items were shock and awe like the lamb with 52 different complementary ingredients, which was fun and interactive (good but by far not the best dish) and the apple balloon with edible string (by far the most fun dish). Other courses emphasized a whole new experience, like the black truffle explosion and the white chocolate dessert made table-side by the chef. Even after 2-plus weeks after eating there, there were a lot of items that I still remember every aspect, this was truly a life-changing meal. Other aspects of the restaurant like the decor itself was nice and dimly lit. The service overall was flawless, but some of the staff was not very friendly and a little stuck-up. Our main server however was fairly interactive and friendly. The kitchen tour was amazing as well, spotless and got a chance to do one of our courses prepared on the spot. Though we did not get to meet Chef Achatz, his current chef there was friendly, articulate, and still producing magnificent food. I would certainly like to see him open his own restaurant in the future. If you made it this far in my review and probably others, just do yourself a favor and just grab a ticket and a date and eat here. You won't regret it. **One additional note here** After eating at Charlie Trotter's about a month before and paying nearly $500 per person with wine. Trotter's didn't come anywhere near to what Alinea produced in terms of experience and food. Although, the wine pairings there were superior."
10,"There are already TONS of professional & amateur reviews of Alinea, you can read through them if you want to get into the details. I'll spend my time here throwing out some general impressions, in no particular order. Enjoy! - Book (buy tickets) way, way, way in advance. This place is booked for at least two months out. - Mental prep - don't over-hype this place before your first visit. Like most other fine dining restaurants, this place is very, very good. However, if you keep thinking this is supposed to be the #1 rated restaurant in the U.S., you're likely to leave disappointed (like my wife and I). - Dinner for the 6 of us took over 6 hours to complete. Make sure you go with fun, good company. Even for couples...it's hard to have a 3-hour dinner together...we saw many bored couples that didn't talk. - Dress nice. Real nice. 'nuff said. - Don't go cheap here. If you are already spending this much on dinner, might as well get the wine pairing (if you like to drink different kinds of wine). Or, if you're like us and don't drink that much, just get a bottle. Expect to spend about $800 - $1,000 for two people. - The food profiles are innovative and presentation was visually stunning. It takes a true genise to come up with each course. However, my wife and I were only ""knock our socks off wowed"" by just a few courses. We particularly liked the razor clams, crab, and mushrooms served on heated stones. - Service - it's nice, but less formal / attentive than what I would expect at a place like this. Not that we enjoy a place that is super formal and stuffy, but it felt a bit too casual for us. - We also would have appreciated a bit more explanation of what we are eating before each course. Our waiter just didn't know or wanted to spend the time to explain. In fact, it was a bit annoying that he wants us to guess what we were eating. Really annoying, now that I think about it again. We paid good money to eat there, show an effort to explain things. - Just to be clear, none of the courses tasted bad. We were just looking to be wowed by each course...and it didn't happen. - Dessert - while seeing them prepare it in front of us was cool, it really wasn't that complex and the taste was a bit disappointing. - Valet - it's only $11, do it. It's a nice touch that they already have the car pulled up front waiting for you by the time you walk out the door."
11,"Your life is a countdown ever since you're born. This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time. It's just money, charge it or sell a kidney or forgo college. You surely have four hours to spare. Con your old-guard boss with aviator glasses in a polyester suit to let you off an hour or two early. Everyone has defining moments in their lives. Birthdays. Trips. Graduations. Weddings. Births. Deaths. Break-ups. We all have things that help shape who we are as an individual. We all have experiences that are out of this world and make you sit back and just think. Alinea is one of those experiences. But it's so powerful because it evokes those of your past, basically everything, or at least a lot, and brings it to the present. I recalled memories of my childhood in Antioch, Illinois at my grandmother's cottage. I recalled summers and late nights at my childhood home. I recalled a trip up the coast of California I did with my family in 2003. I recalled cakes and desserts I ate as a kid. I recalled previous meals and dining experiences. I was so pleasantly delighted. I wasn't overwhelmed, although I could see why you would be. I laughed. I smiled. I got a little nervous. I don't want to elaborate too much on courses, atmosphere, or service, except for to say that it's all essentially perfect. You will not ""love"" every course, but most will stand out to you. Classics like hot potato cold potato, and black truffle explosion will surely stand out, and seasonal touches like the tomato dish will certainly be a highlight. There might be one you don't like. I didn't like the fishbowl course. But I wouldn't change it because it reminded me one time of eating a hot dog as a kid and hating it (little did I know I'd go on to consume ten thousand hot dogs at Hot Doug's about 15 years later). All I have to say of the atmosphere...I was freaked out, delighted, oh, and surprised by the entryway. Amuse-bouche included. The waitstaff is friendly, unpretentious, helpful, funny, and all around amazing. You'll laugh with them, they'll joke, they'll instruct you, they'll help you determine wines or beverages, and if you're lucky, they'll take you to the kitchen afterwords. The essence of Alinea and the finale, is the dessert. Do not ignore. Pay attention. If you're lucky (I was) Chef Achatz will prepare it for you himself. I feel ridiculous for ever saying anything was #1 in the past. This fucks everything up, this defines everything, breaks rules, sets new standards, and all around marks a time in history in your life. The aftermath will overwhelm and delight you and make you speechless. This is a metaphorical acid trip. This is what living is... This is Alinea. I'll probably never sit on the hallway of my condo building floor and purchase tickets for a restaurant again. I love you, Alinea. I really, really do. You are a part of me forever."
12,"Lots of complaints about how difficult it is to get in and I get it, its hard. But I can promise you that it is worth it. This is dining as performance art. And that is not to say that the food takes a backseat to the show. The theatricality of the presentations perfectly honors the beauty of the meal. To go over the details would be to give away too many surprises, but we had a fantastic time. You are treated like a VIP from the moment you walk up to the unmarked door. But this VIP treatment also has a wonderful comfortableness about it. It doesn't feel stuffy. We ended up chatting with the table next to us because it was just too fun. You get the sense that they are encouraging the playfulness to go along with the fun they obviously had coming up with the amazing experience. Do whatever you have to to get in here. It's a meal and and experience that you won't soon forget."
13,"1st I will say I'm not a foodie but I enjoy dining w foodies. The service was impeccable. The presentation of food was truly marvelous. I am allergic to all seafood & fish. My friend is a vegetarian. They prepared special menus for both. Now to the food. Some courses were delicious others were ok. Everything was too small. Even if u liked it was gone in 3 bites. Even though there were so many courses we left hungry & went out afterwards. 2 of my friends are foodies & have been to very elite restaurants. Also, I do not have a need to be stuffed after eating out, but I do want to be satisfied. I was neither which was disappointing considering the price tag. The atmosphere was quiet. Was good girls night out. Dessert was huge disappointment. Dippin dots spread all over table. Price in my opinion not worth it. The biggest irritation was the champaign @ beginning of meal was brought out though we did not request it. I assumed it was complimentary. However it turned out to be $100 each. I only drank part of mine had I known definitely would have finished. Overall had a good evening. Glad I went but would not go again. If you don't mind paying $350 (w/o wine pairings) for 1 meal then consider checking out."
14,"Today marks one year since my dinner at Alinea. It was the finest dining experience of my life and it lived up to all of my lofty expectations. In hindsight, it is not the culinary party tricks or the use of technology that still lingers in the forefront of my mind (although each innovative technique employed delighted me and served to advance each dish). My memories fall back on the bright, harmonious flavors and the impeccable (at at times, playful) service. To borrow from Michelin's own rubric, Alinea provided me ""exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey."" So much so that I I cannot imagine another trip to Chicago without partaking of what ever joys that Achatz may have in store."
15,"In my four years as a member of Yelp!, I've written a grand total of two - count 'em, TWO - restaurant reviews. As much as I consider myself a foodie, I'm just not big on writing about food. And even though I've had the pleasure of ""collecting"" over 20 Michelin stars from dining standards like Wolfgang Puck's Spago to bucket-list restaurants like Thomas Keller's The French Laundry and Per Se over the past few years, I've never really felt compelled to write a review about any of them. Then I dined at Alinea, Grant Achatz's Michelin three-starred restaurant in Chicago at the forefront of American molecular gastronomy. FOOD: First things first: at Alinea, unlike the aforementioned The French Laundry and Per Se, food is as much about spectacle as it is about taste. The plating and presentation of the dishes here were by far the most creative I've ever experienced. A few were gimmicky (e.g. four pieces of seafood entangled in seaweed atop a giant piece of driftwood), but most were functional - and all were extremely fun, especially the green apple balloon and the ""cracked"" white chocolate egg. Now if you're worried that Chef Achatz is all style and no substance - as I was - let me reassure you: some of his dishes were among the best I've ever eaten. The aforementioned ""four pieces of seafood"" were the best bites of crab, lobster, and clam I've ever had, the corn dish was out of this world, and you can't go wrong with two of Chef Achatz's signature dishes: ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato"" and ""Black Truffle Explosion."" My sister and I also went to town on the final dessert, the ""cracked"" white chocolate egg that covered the entire table, and finished the entire thing, which was no easy feat considering it was the 19th and final course - and also the largest. SERVICE: Like any Michelin-starred restaurant, the service here is top-notch - dishes always arrived with razor-like synchronicity, every course was explained thoroughly, crumbs were always brushed away, and my wine glass was never left empty. If I have one complaint, it's that I felt the service here was a bit more relaxed than what I've experienced at Thomas Keller's restaurants or at Joel Robuchon's three Tokyo establishments. The servers were always professional, but they had a more casual attitude than what I'm used to at restaurants of this caliber. Some people don't like the ""stuffy"" atmosphere of fine dining restaurants, but if I'm gonna pay an arm and a leg for a meal fit for a king, I don't mind being treated like one. AMBIANCE: Other than the darkened entrance hall with its neon outlines and grassy walkway, I was not particularly impressed by the decor of the restaurant - it's mainly black and white with accent lighting in various shades of neon. But I think that's kind of the point. Each of the food presentations here is like its own work of art, so the restaurant itself is like the blank canvas upon which these works of art are presented. Nowhere was this more obvious than during the ""cracked"" white chocolate egg dessert course, which utilized the entire table - covered with a latex tablecloth, of course - as a canvas. I will say, though, that the noise level in the restaurant was a bit on the louder end, which again created a more casual atmosphere than what I'm used to at Michelin-starred restaurants. VERDICT: I'm not an easily impressed diner, and I don't like writing food reviews. But Alinea surpassed all of my expectations and then some, and my dining experience here prompted me to do the unthinkable: to write a review on Yelp!. And that's just it - you don't just have dinner at Alinea; you have a DINING EXPERIENCE. One that I will never forget."
16,"I had wanted to visit Alinea since 2007, but was never organized enough to make a reservation and it was always going to happen for a perpetually unnamed ""special occasion"". Then, last week, they switched to a ticketing system a-la 'Next', and I happened to be lucky (and F5-happy) enough get a prime time Friday night table, just a week later. Spoiler alert: if you're planning on going and like surprises, stop reading here (actually, stop reading these reviews in general) and just go. I'm not even going to attempt to describe all of the dishes from last night's meal, but some highlights: Walking through the front door into a shrinking corridor, to be greeted with a glass of lemonade, drunk while walking over the carpeting of fresh turf to the sound of a wind chime. Watching Grant Achatz inspecting dishes leaving the kitchen, and then later, serving a masterpiece of a dessert directly onto the table next to ours. Eating a chunk of tempura-fried fruit and brie, served on a burning cinnamon stick skewer. The black truffle explosion, so flavorful I think it may have literally permeated the flesh of my mouth. I can still taste truffles the next day. Wondering how long I should wait before I see a doctor about it. Being served three small cuts of lamb... with a tray of 60 different beautiful, weird accompaniments to choose from. Sucking helium from an edible apple-flavored balloon. Getting apple-flavored balloon goo all over my face. Then making a loud and borderline inappropriate ""that's what she said"" joke, in squeaky helium voice. The wine pairings. Do it. The front of house staff, all flawlessly professional but completely approachable, and immediately likable. They have hit a magical spot where formal fine dining service feels comfortable, welcoming, and friendly. I also heard them jokingly tell the table behind us ""we're expecting to read some good Yelp reviews tomorrow"". :-) I like simple, traditional meals as much as the next person, and admit to sometimes being skeptical about molecular gastronomy. I now understand that the techniques used at Alinea aren't just for show: every dish uses the chef's mad scientist skills to invoke an emotion, bring back memories, and sometimes just make you laugh. If that isn't food for the soul, what is?"
17,"I dined at Alinea a few weeks ago with my son for his 25th birthday. He was quite excited to have scored tickets with their new ticketing system and on his birthday nonetheless! I had heard of Alinea a few years ago when they first opened and wondered what it was all about. My impression before going there was too expensive & ""weird"" food. Couldn't imagine eating that many courses. Well, what an amazing experience. I could only compare it to Charlie Trotter's where I dined a few months back. This blows Charlie's away. (Sorry Charlie) The restaurant doesn't have a sign out in front (liked that) & a nice young man greeted us & we entered. The hallway floor was real grass--real grass with a small set up with fresh lemonade. We were then led to our table. The restaurant has no music playing & is fairly modern but simple. They ask about allergies, wine pairings, etc and the experience begins. I won't go into detail on every course as there were simply too many & I frankly couldn't remember what they consisted of. But there was a seafood course served on a piece of driftwood that was to die for. Also, a mushroom dish on hot stones that was amazing as well. A summer salad of some sort with everything fresh (delicious). I can only remember disliking one dish & the little pieces of ginger they served on these little skewer things was just okay. The hot potato/cold potato & truffle explosion that I had heard of famously were also just amazing! The service was excellent and the waiters each one nicer than the next. The courses were spaced apart nicely but not too far apart or close together. They brought my son a special chocolate desert for his birthday compliments of the staff which was really nice (and no singing happy birthday!) The desert was amazing & then we had the privilege of having Chef Achatz serve us the famous white chocolate pinata himself! My son was awestruck & the expression on his face was priceless--well worth the price of the meal! So was this worth it? It most definitely was. Years back, I could never have imagined spending that much money on a meal. But, the way I look at it, many people spend comparable amounts on dinner & a concert, dinner & movie, drinks out, a night at the opera or theter, whatever it is you like--cigarettes, Starbucks, etc. This was a magical night with my son & one we will always remember......can't put a price on that."
18,"So, we were fortunate enough to score Sunday dinner reservations after the restaurant moved from its phone-based reservation system to the 'Next-like online ticketing system. I can honesty say that this was the pinnacle of dining experiences for me - that every fine dining establishment from this point forward will be judged against my experience. I'm not sure if this is fair, because Grant Achatz and team set an insanely high bar. Prior to dining at Alinea, literally an hour before, I finished reading Grant and Nick's autobiography 'Life on the Line'. I appreciated having the insight into the creative passion and love for food that drives Alinea staff. I'm also slated for a trip to San Francisco in the Fall and am very much looking forward to scoring (hopefully) reservations at The French Laundry, which had a huge influence on Chef Achatz. Fingers crossed that my redial finger make it through to the reservationists. Back to Alinea - We're not going course-by-course in this review, as I agree with many other Yelpers, that just simply ruins the experience. Although, I'm guessing that the Fall menu isn't too far from around the corner, which has me eager to go back for sure. From the time you check-in with the doorman to the moment you step through into the darkened, wedge-like hallway, your dinner begins and it doesn't stop for almost four hours. Every detail is meticulously considered and it shows - at the time I confirmed our reservations and any dietary restrictions or other notes of importance for the staff, I did not notify them that my other half was left handed. I didn't realize that was even a reason to make a special note, but at Alinea it is. Once they realized he was left handed, every course was situated and placed correctly in front of him. I know for some the ticketing system has been a nightmare (and the person who rated the restaurant one star based on her inability to get a reservation really irks me), but perseverance and patience will pay off. If you get a reservation or have the opportunity to make one - don't think about it, just do it, turn yourself over to Alinea staff and be prepared to be blown away."
19,"All of these reviews likely tell you the various ways and courses that Alinea is incredible. All the ""best meals of my life""s and culinary discourses. But, looking at the price tag and the difficulty in acquiring a table, you may still be asking yourself, ""Yeah...but is this just hype or is it Really Worth it?"" Let me answer that- IT IS. I could tell how every bite of every course was one of the best, most interesting, most surprising things I have ever eaten and how it has changed how I experience food and dining. I could tell you that the wine pairings were spectacular and pushed each course to yet another level. I could tell you that I was a little starstruck by Grant Achatz and wished I'd snuck in a photo of him creating the final course tableside for people close to us (if I hadn't being playing it ""I totally belong here"" cool and trying to keep the delivery of that course a surprise). I could also tell you that the service was formal but personable enough that when we had a 'hands free"" course that I was comfy enough to raise mine up ala on a rollercoaster or ""look, ma! no hands!"". I could tell you all of those things....but the fact that I was, mid-dinner, scheming how I could save up to come again, soon, may be all you need to hear from me."
20,"This is really the greatest restaurant I have been to in ...forever. For a truly special occasion, this is the place to have a great time. Those who give it 3 or less stars are not serious reviews. (Since 3 or less stars is just a0ok and 2 is i have had better..) It is unfortunate that some people had very specific bad experiences there but that is more of a rare occurrence from what i have read. Read any of the other 5 star review and you get the idea. IK have been to other chef tasting restaurants for about the same price and no other place match both presentation and taste. My wife and i came with 4 other people and every one of us was blown away by the quality and service. I could go on about the food and the service and the presentation, but there are so many reviews that articulate better than i would or could. This review is really to say that if you are on yelp undecided about this place, my answer is JUST GO!"
21,"Maybe I should have read reviews of this place before I went, but it was a bit too experimental for me. Here is an example of a dish we had: three pieces of well prepared lamb, with 60 possible sauces/herbs/fruits for you to choose to eat the lamb with. Did I seriously just drop almost $300 to compose my own dishes? I'm certainly no expert at doing this and definitely made some suboptimal choices. And do people really like the dessert where they drop things everywhere? It's a cool show but taste-wise, it was pretty far from the best desserts I've had. I have to give it 4*s because a few of the courses were among the best dishes I've ever had, in terms of taste and presentation. Some of my favorites, without going into too much detail for fear of ruining it for others, included an otoro course and a lobster/crab dish. Just know what your getting yourself into: it's much hype, not everything will be even close to the best things you've ever tasted, there won't be as much meat/seafood as courses at other restaurants (one course was only ginger), the reservation system where you buy your table in advance with no ability to change it at all is highly obnoxious and shows how pretentious these people are (no other top restaurants in the country do this). But the presentation of the food was by far the best I've ever experienced. So there are some things to cheer about."
22,"I have never worked this hard to get a reservation. Looking for a reservation for the first week of August, I started stalking the web site as soon as July rolled around. A seemingly endless series of cryptic promises and updates eventually culminated with the roll out of the new ""a la Next"" ticketing system. Fortunately a coworker caught the release as it was happening, and half an hour later I was sitting on tickets for a four top. But I was looking for a reservation for 3. Turns out thats not something that Alinea's new ticketing system can accommodate. Problem? Not at all. Turns out this is a heck of a popular place, so without much fuss, we were able to find a fourth to join us on our culinary adventure. Concerns about the awkwardness of spending 4 hours with a stranger were entirely unfounded. Its amazing how shared admiration for breathtaking food can bring people together.. At a price tag of $280 (sans drinks), this place had a lot to live up to. I am very happy to report that I think it was worth every penny. While there are plenty of fine dining establishments providing you with fine culinary fare, Alinea is providing you with a complete experience. Dinner and a show. I was surprised by the extent to which the restaurant made use of molecular gastronomy, but the bells and whistles added rather than detracted every time. Innovative techniques and ingredients came together in surprising and wonderful ways. I wont provide any details of how; I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise. Just go, and be prepared to have your mind blown."
23,"The best restaurant I have ever been to, hands down. Well above even the French Laundry."
24,"First, let me start by saying that it took me two years (at 20 a paycheck- my favorite way to save for restaurant experiences) to save up for my trip to Alinea. Every since I found out that the best restaurant in the U.S. was in my favorite city, I knew I needed to go. This was my third Michelin starred restaurant, but my first three star, and it did not disappoint. I found securing the reservations through the ticketing system to be quite simple, and am hoping other restaurants of this caliber switch to this method in the future. My night at Alinea was perfection from the moment it began- from the gentlemen helping me out of my cab, to the few minutes I got to spend watching the kitchen work, and of course the food and the service. I'm not going to write a review explaining the food, but I did enjoy every course. There were certainly some I preferred over others, but nothing was bad or even close to bad. I agree with other reviewers that for several of the courses I wanted more than one bite, though I was definitely full at the end of the meal. My boyfriend and I did have the wine pairings with the dinner, and that is the only thing I regret. Neither of us are huge wine people, and therefore it was really too much wine for me. If I were to go again, I would probably do a bottle to share instead or try a few glasses from the pairing (if they do that, I did not ask). I did not love all 10 pairings, but enjoyed 9 of the 10. My favorite part of Alinea, besides the food of course, was admiring all of the beautiful pieces that were created to serve the food at this restaurant. Brilliant minds established this place, and everything about the design was perfect down to the smallest detail. I found the service to be excellent for my table, and all of the courses were well explained. We also had fun asking questions of the staff, and they had all sorts of fun stories and great laughes which added to our meal. I likely won't be back to Alinea, but only because it is cost prohibitive for me. If you have the chance to experience Alinea, I would make the trip- it was a once in a lifetime evening for me."
25,"Part of me wants to give this resto five stars and part of me wants to give it 1 star, I'll give it two. I've been here four times. The first time, shortly after they opened was my best experience. Every time since then, I've had condescending servers. It's too bad the front of the house doesn't have half the sense of the humor that the kitchen has. It's made the last three meals there unpleasant. On a different note, this ticket system is for the birds and I won't bother even trying to go to any of these restaurants or joining facebook or trying to score tickets. It's a waste of time, confusing and to be honest, insulting. I'll go to Next or Alinea if someone invites me and that's it."
26,"The day had finally come for our dinner at Alinea! I have never tried as hard as I did to get a reservation at ANY restaurant as I did with Alinea. Since they announced they were switching to a Next-like ticketing system, it became an obsession of mine for over a month to check their website and Facebook page every half an hour, eagerly waiting their release of August tickets. Being from out of town, I only had 3 nights that would have worked for my schedule so that made it even harder to secure a reservation. On that fateful afternoon that the tickets were released, I only found out about 15 minutes after they went on sale and they were almost all sold out. I was extremely lucky to snatch up the last available table for 2 for the day that would work for me. Tickets to this restaurant were tougher to get than Justin Bieber concert tickets! (ok bad analogy) The many hours of my life spent religiously checking their website was worth it. It was by far the best dining experience ever. What all the other Yelpers have already said is true. Simply amazing."
27,"I agree with many of the yelpers from 3 to five star posting in August 2012. Service was great. Did the reserve wine pairing. Great pairing. I regret I'm a lightweight drinker so I barely made it to the end. I was heaving near the prisitine women's second floor private washroom coveted bowl wishing I didn't finish all my pours trying to keep up with the husband. Sparkling water was a no no. It made my belly full. I missed out enjoying the only true savory meat dish. It would have been an awesome highlight for me. It was a delight for a chef to come out and ""plate"" our dessert. Would go back again."
28,"what can be said that hasn't already been said? dinner this past sunday was the most fun i've had in a while. from the moment we stepped out of the cab to the moment we got back in one after the 19 course meal, alinea carved out a complete sensory experience--every one of my sense were tickled and prodded to attention. you go for the experience, for the fun, to be amazed. there's no music playing in the background to drown out noise from the kitchen or conversations at nearby tables. there are no candles, tablecloth, or mini flower centerpieces on the table. it's just you, your dining companion, the staff, and the food. and that's all you need for the 4 hours. the food itself wasn't always perfect. certain dishes were overly salty (trio if lamb, razor clam), some didn't make sense (corn silk dish, sea salt foam on the otoro dish), but when it was good, it was some of the best and most creative food i've ever had (steelhead roe straw w/ peach, hot cold potato, black truffle dumpling explosion, watermelon snow w/ chili and tomato). again, have fun and be amazed. what's the point otherwise?"
29,"An experience to remember!!! We had a 15 course meal with the wine pairing. Every course was unique in its own way. The wine pairing enhanced all of the dishes as long as you don't mind spending $150/person on top of the $210 meal. As long as you enjoy seafood and trying new things, I would highly recommend to try this place once in your lifetime. Many of the courses could only be explained as having ""explosions in my mouth!"" Oh yeah.. the wine pairings made us quite tipsy!!!!!"
30,"I flew out from Los Angeles just to have dinner at Alinea. Although I am certified broke now, the whole trip was worth every penny! This is a highly sought after restaurant. It has opened since 2005 and is still going strong. So don't you dare to call it a hype! I had my wonderful experience on this past Saturday. The restaurant is spaced out in different pods. We were seated in one of their pods upstairs. Table was not set until my party sat down. The staff set it in front of us and jokingly explained that they had shrunk the table cloth to a small pillow, hence, no table cloth. An unconventional start. I didn't go for the wine pairings because I am no wine expert. I 'd rather save my taste buds for the delicate dishes. Food was then served promptly after he explained how it worked. There was no music on the background. I could actually hear other patrons' conversations and their ooooh's and ahhhh's. It could easily be me having a dinner party in my imaginary designer dining room. Everybody looked relaxed and was having fun. That's how I felt. It's a casual and cozy environment. I did not get pretentious from Alinea, given that this is a michellin 3 star restaurant. I never feel rushed. They didn't give me dirty looks for taking too many pictures. They even gave me a heads up before the balloon came out because it didn't do well in room temperature, so I could start snapping pictures as soon as my balloon was escorted out. Not only did the food look super appetizing (with the help of vibrant colors and intriguing plating), it tasted phenomenal too! Portion was small but definitely a party in every bite! As I understood, the whole meal was divided into 3 series, tastes from the ocean, the earth and then dessert. And they were not kidding, each bite captured the flavors very well. From the taste to plating, every detail was well designed and executed. Each bite was precious and worked harmoniously with each other. One of my highlights was the sighting of Chef Achatz! He would go to most tables to create the final course himself and smashed those eggs. It was a pleasure to see him popping up here and there throughout the night. When he came to my table and worked his magic, it was a show and he knew it. He gave a performance without being over-the-top. He was different from other celebrity chefs. Don't expect him to make small talks. He explained the course matter-of-factly. As soon as it was done, he would leave. Not aloof (in my opinion), but kept it professional. One thing is very different from other restaurants was that staffs never introduced themselves and they constantly changed. Among 15 courses, I think I had at least 7 different staffs served at our table, and I only knew one of their names (slipped out accidentally). They were very attentive but not pushy, and they all had similar sense of humor. They kept making witty dry comments. I wonder if they had a script or guidelines for what they may or may not say. All in all, I had a great time. It is an experience that evokes all of your senses. I will definitely go back! Trivia: I had the pleasure to tour the kitchen at the end of dinner. It's a medium sized kitchen with no actual fire going on. Helium tank fills up balloon regularly. They clean the kitchen 4 times a day. It did look spotless to me. The expediter was only 21-year-old and great at what he's doing. All servers run up and down the service stairs like hundred times a day. There are 20 tables in total and filled up every night. Each service ware is an art form so take your time to admire it."
31,"Amazing, excellent molecular gastronomy at it's best! I read Chef Achatz book titled: ""Life on the LIne"" and was truly amazed and inspired by his desire for excellence, his passion for food, and his strength and tenacity to overcome cancer. It is food heaven and is truly indescribable. If you are a foody you will know to experience Alinea. A great once in a lifetime experience!"
32,"The service deserves five stars. The food is overhyped. Only about three or four of the 18 dishes were truly outstanding. Dessert involved someone coming out with a white chocolate balloon, tossing a bunch of powdered strawberries on the table and squiggling cream all over the place."
33,"Yes, it's worth it folks. The tasty and interactive experience started at the door. Didn't really know half of the items I was eating, but who cares."
34,"I've eaten at some great restaurants all over the world, and I don't get Alinea. It's simply irritating. Yes, a few courses are knockouts. But there are also clunkers. The real problem, though, is the didactic nature of the place. We were instructed in how te eat almost every bite: ""Put the whole thing in your mouth"" (it was huge), ""Inhale this smoke while you take a bite"", """"Don't injure yourself on this ridiculous spike we served it on."" Then came dessert. They rolled out a rubber sheet, and several ""chefs"" literally smeared various stuff all over it in from of us. I am not making this up. Not only is this not the best restaurant in Chicago, it's one of the worst fine dining experiences I've had in Chicago. Service is stiff, the decor is austere, I just don't get it."
35,"If you are fortunate enough to be able to afford Alinea then my advice is to do it. Yes, I felt like collapsing to the floor when the bill came, but the experience and food was so damn good that I could rationalize it. Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience. Much of what makes Alinea so special is the element of surprise and creativity, so I will not divulge its secrets. I will say that each course is so incredibly delicious and innovative that Alinea ranks as the best overall dinning experience I've ever had. Yelp needs to add another star for Alinea."
36,"I've been wanting to go to Alinea for years, but it's one of those places you need a special occassion to really appreciate the $$! Luckily my hubs surprised me for my 30th birthday! It was everything I thought it would be and it was SO worth the wait. Every single dish was a full experience that transformed you into a specific feeling or moment (I presume this is why Next has been so successful as well!!). I loved the full sensory experience the the amount of fine detail in each dish is just crazy. Highlights: Green Curry Tuna - tuna with green curry foam, lemongrass ice, and a salty cream (they described as a taste of ocean) served in a fishbowl! It literally transformed me to a delicious refreshing Thai beachside (and I was just in Thailand earlier this year!) Morels served on river rocks with delicious accoutrements - date compote type thing, quail egg, asparagus, ramps, and more....took me to an amazing forest that tasted delicious and earthy Hot Potato/Cold Potato - He's so famous for this dish and there just aren't words for the overwhelming sensations of hot cold, rich, smooth etcetcetc sensations. I think the brilliance is it leaves you wanting sooo much more! Truffle Ravioli - How did he come up with filling a ravioli with liquid! the truffle and parmesan are such an amazing compliement. Again, another one bite that leaves you wanting. And there were many many more! I can't hold my liquor but my husband got the pairings and I got sips so I could get a small taste. It was absolute perfection the way their paired the wines with each dish. Light and crisp when needed, rich and complex when needed. So perfect. I don't know if I'll ever be back but wow was it amazing. Now to try to get those NEXT tickets!!!"
37,"Creativity is off the charts. Very little here has been done before. Grant Achatz is truly a genius, though I have to wonder about what's going on in his head as he's about to smash a giant egg on my table. Service can be pretty casual, but very attentive. It's not a bad thing at all, but these guys aren't stiff, nor are they very formal. They are, however, true pros who wouldn't surprise me if they imbibe in little green plants that grow from the earth and are best consumed aromatically. The wine guy/som, Richard Richardson is someone very special. An obvious savant and master of his trade. It's a true pleasure to witness his art. The cuisine is unbelievable. He goes so far over the edge, jumps off of a cliff, yet still has me wanting more of every bite. Most chefs can't stay inside the fence and pull that off. Amazing."
38,"The most unique dining experience I've had in awhile. Been anxiously waiting to try the best restaurant in America. It didn't disappoint. The food was perhaps a four but the presentation and creativity of the dining experience was a six. Just a few highlights.... Hot and cold potato - a modern interpretation of deliciousness A black truffle ravioli - wow just an explosive of tastiness Lamb - served three ways with an accompiament of 86 different flavor tastes. Like a mad scientist workshop on a plate Taffy balloon - seriously, filled with helium on an apple cord string. Unbelievably inventive and mind blowing As expected, great service. A few dishes were a miss on flavor profile but all were exciting and truly unexpectedly unique. Worth the trip and expense."
39,"Five stars for everything except the price. The meal for two people with wine pairing was almost $1000! It was a FANTASTIC experience. Their service was exceptional and they made you feel REALLY exclusive. Oh yes, as I left the restroom on the way back to my table at the restaurant, a handsome gentleman smiled at me and I smiled back. Five seconds after that, I realized that was ZAC EFRON! Haha! The food: They have a prix fixe menu everyday so I can't really recommend what to order. Of course people that go their trust the chefs and let them decide. I had a 18-course dinner that night, every single one was excellent! Very novel presentation of the food and perfect combination of different flavors. My personal favorites were the hot potato cold potato and the black truffle explosion. Phenomenal!!!"
40,"I couldn't believe I was able to get in Alinea on the day I called. I was on a business trip in January to Chicago and my original dinner plan fell through so I decided to call Alinea to see if they have any availabilities for that same day. Luck was on my side that day. The staff called back and said they had room at 9:30PM. I was super ecstatic! Who says you have to call two months ahead? =P Yes, I went to Alinea and ate by myself. I was not going to let this opportunity pass me by. It's hard to describe the wonderful experience I had at Alinea. Without a doubt, it was one of my favorite meals! I think I had 20 courses. For $210 for the meal, I truly believe it was a bargain. I got there a bit early (9:00pm, i know i was overly excited), and I still managed to be there until past 12am. I didn't get the wine pairing because there was no way i could drink that much alcohol and be able to wake up early in the morning for a tradeshow. I just ordered a glass of rose champagne to start the night off. ( If I had company and didn't have to go to a tradeshow in the morning, i'd definitely get the wine pairing to compliment the yummy dishes!) Every single dish was either served with a story or a purpose. It was an overall sensory experience. You enjoy the culinary adventure by not just tasting the food, but also hearing, smelling, and seeing the food. Not a single dish was served the same way. Some of the presentations are just so creative. No wonder it is ranked as one of the tops restaurants in the world. If you have a chance to be in Chicago, you should definitely try Alinea! You won't regret it."
41,"Alinea surpassed all of my expectations, which is pretty impressive because I had set a pretty high standard in my mind. The experience was unique, fun, amazing and most importantly, it tasted really, really good. I was a bit worried that technique would overshadow the food. I'm a pretty died in the wool farm to table kind of girl, but I was so wrong. The techniques are interesting and playful. They do not detract from the food, rather they transform it into an experience unlike any other. While the food is the heart of the matter, many other people have broken that down in detail, so I will focus on the experience. I was nestled in a lovely chair (why don't all restaurants have such wonderful chairs?) and served by a cadre of staff the most strange and wonderful food. I was very impressed with the staff, they were an excellent blend of knowledgeable, sociable, and smart. Surely this is fine dining, but it was not in the least bit stuffy. I found the young sommelier especially charming. Even though the food may be presented in bizarre ways (apple balloon) the flavors may ring so true as to whisk you off in a food memory. The dashi almost made me tear. That may sounds really silly to most people. But I'm an LA born-Tokyo loving food fiend studying in Omaha, so chew on that for a second. The dashi's flavors were so clear, I felt home and comforted and I was almost overwhelmed. I was not at all prepared for the experience. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity, best present ever."
42,"Second time I've eaten here and I was happy to have hit a new menu so it was a somewhat new experience. But, it's kind of like going to a Cirque Du Soleil show. There are only so many ways an asian woman can contort her spine and there are only so many ways one can splash dessert all over a table cloth. Seen one, you've seen them all. I definitely recommend the elite/high-end wine pairing. Some rather exceptional wines from small producers all over. Like watching the sequel to any movie, it's just not as good as the original, because the element of surprise is not there. But, once in your life time... for sure. Do it. And buy the recipe book so you can see all the wonderful things you can't possibly create without upgrading your entire kitchen."
43,"Best restaurant I have ever visited in the United States. Creative food, great service and comfortable decor. As an artist, I am impressed by the plating of the food. Where else can you eat a helium balloon in the States? Different from other restaurants, the food is also great! As a vegetarian, I appreciate the thoughts that the chef put behind the food. While the bomb dessert is very similar to that in Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong, it nonetheless still makes me feels like a little child again. My friends and I had a amazing time here! MUST GO! Food: 5 Decor: 4 Service: 5"
44,"My 100th review.. I'm going to make it about the best restaurant I've been to in my life thus far... Actually.. 6 Stars The Intro: Considered to be the best restaurant in the United States Chef Grant Achatz is a true master at the craft of molecular gastronomy. Alinea has received 3 Michelin stars and dozens of accolades. The Food: Our meal that we had consisted of 17 stunning and innovative courses finishing off with a big finale dessert prepared by non other than Chef Achatz himself right on the table. Not only is every course delicious but every dish was a different experience. Center pieces were used to present in the middle of the table to be saved for uses in a certain course. I had a bunch of courses described in this review but i realized I didn't want to spoil it for foodies that haven't been here so I deleted it. Every course is a surprise on it's own. Even though I liked and was amazed by every course some of the course that I thought was just made me speechless was Hot Potato Cold Potato, Taste of the Ocean, Farm Salad, Peach and Black Truffle Explosion. Like I said I'm not going to spoil these course for you by describing them, you're going to have to experience it for yourself. The Decor: Very low key on the outside and not much to look at but once you step inside... Wow!! Stunning looking restaurant. Automatic doors slide open at the end of the hallway after you open the front door. Once you step in you can see the very busy kitchen right behind the maitreid's podium. Very modern and chic. throughout the whole dining room. The Service: Impeccable, One of the best services I've ever had in all my dining experiences. They made us feel very comfortable right from the start. All the servers that served our food did a great job of describing our dishes and teaching us on how to eat them. They were also very comedic at times when serving our dishes. It was fun. The best was when Chef came at the very end and chatted with us a little bit while he was ""painting"" our dessert. Everyone was so professional and nice. The Summary: Definitely worth the experience and trip. The expert critics were right as to vote this place the number one restaurant in America. My wife and I decided to make a annual trip to Chicago just to dine here after this meal. I can tell Chef Achatz is a very passionate and hard working chef by his food. On top of that he is not arrogant but a very nice and humble chef. He is by far my favorite chef to date. For all you true foodies out there, this is a place no matter where you are in the world, call Alinea, make a reservation, buy a ticket and fly to Chicago and you will have the most amazing meal of your life."
45,"Alinea was a slam dunk. The food was everything I imagined, and I loved every bite. Even a month after my meal, I still have memories of the taste of many of the dishes. Our hand-down favorite dish: Burnt Morels. We opted to not do the wine pairing, as my wife had a half-bottle of wine, and I had 3 different types of beers."
46,"Here are two facts: 1. The single best bite of food I've ever tasted was at Alinea (and that isn't hyperbole, I can still recall each flavor and how they mixed together) 2. The meal as a whole was very disappointing I loved a quarter of the courses in this experience, thought a third were pretty good, and the rest were sub par at best. We only had 18 courses. One of those courses was a leaf, literally a leaf on a plate. Another course was based on peas. Yes, an entire course on peas. My girlfriend and I discussed a few weeks later (meal was in July 2011) and concluded that the summer menu just must not compare to the other seasons. Otherwise we didn't understand the accolades. We've eaten at Moto, and that was signifcantly better. Another explanation is that perhaps Alinea is just hit or miss based on that night's menu. But if that's the case, then they've failed. At the prices you're paying, it has to be awesome every single time. Ours definitely wasn't. And there's the rub. I would gladly pay whatever to eat that one wonderful bite of food again... but can't. I would gladly pay the Alinea price to be able to pick my own menu from several selections at each stage... but can't. And since I have no control at all then you have to do better than odd tasting peas and a leaf on a plate. Service was absolutely top notch. Last note: after we left my gf and I were both hungry (and we are not big eaters). We actually debated going to grab an appetizer or dessert somewhere else afterward, and just barely decided against since it was so late. And we ate everything put in front of us at Alinea."
47,A meal of a lifetime. My only advice? Stop reading this! It's so much more special to experience this restaurant with no prior knowledge of what the food entails. There's a reason why the restaurant is so low-key on the exterior...absolutely life changing
48,"Walk in with an open mind. You know you develop the irrational dislikes and likes in regards to what you are willing to expose yourself to? Yeah, do yourself a favor, throw it all away. I have never been one for molecular gastronomy, but going to this restaurant has given me a fresh perspective into believing in the science - or art. When they say 'no course is the same' they really do mean it. The beginning of the night started with the waiter asking me of my likes, dislikes, food allergies, and whatever else I would prefer. They fit every course around what I had specified. The presentation was impeccable - less a dish that you eat, rather a grand presentation that you watch unfold, becomes your dish, and finally you enjoy every bite. One of my dishes was presented, oddly, to me on a pillow - yeah, you heard it, pillow. When I was ready to dive into the dish, the waiter punctured the pillow and off I went. I know smell is directly related to how your food tastes, but it couldn't be more apparent than this. There are quite a few people who are critical of this restaurant and a few more who rave about this restaurant; even if you have read the bad reviews, it's worth a try. It's a meal of a life-time that I plan on having a few more times in this life. Please be on time! A bit of a winter storm was barreling down and they called me 10 minutes prior to my reservation to see if I was showing up or not. They have a 15 minute window in which they will cancel your reservation. The restaurant staff is very direct in enforcing the dress-code through their information they provide on the phone. However, when I was there in person, there was a guy with a t-shirt and shorts. Um, what? I'm letting that slip, the food, experience and environment just are incredible!!"
49,"No question, one of the coolest and most interesting restaurants I've been to. Definitely the mecca of molecular gastronomy, Achatz does an amazing job combining creatively presented and sourced food with palate pleasing flavors. There wasn't too much with the preparation of specific dishes that necessarily impressed me (ie, some of the best tasting dishes, like the hot potato cold potato or the black truffle explosion are not too difficult to make), but more just the thought that went into the creation and presentation of the dishes. Reservations, as you might imagine, are difficult to come by. I believe you need to reserve 2 months in advance, and call in on the first day of the month, two months before you plan to go. Service was top notch, and the food / experience was worth the time and money."
50,"I was expecting more. That's basically my summed-up experience. One thing I will say, is that half the fun is the surprise element of the food, so reading all the reviews is not the best idea. I did it- because I wanted to know what that price tag was going towards- but it definitely took away from the experience and if there's one thing I'd recommend is STOP READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD. and STOP LOOKING AT THE PICTURES! STOP! RIGHT NOW!! For that much money, I expect the things I eat to be REALLY DELICIOUS. Not just ""good, and cool presentation!"" but REALLY DELICIOUS. Overall I would say maybe 3 courses I would say that, the rest were... pretty good. Like I said, I expected more. Also, I made the reservation for a special occasion (first wedding anniversary) but nobody asked me if there was an occasion when I made the reservation. Most nice places do- even a Morton's will ask you, and then print ""happy anniversary!"" on your menu. Nothing here. Like I said, I expected more. GT Fish and Oyster wished my husband a happy birthday when we arrived, and when we were seated, and then gave him a birthday gift before we left. THAT is service. Alinea could learn a thing or two. However as far as service goes, I was pretty pleased. I didn't have any of the issues I saw other people comment on. My husband and I don't drink, and nobody pressured us to order something we didn't want. We did several of the house sodas which were tasty. The bottom line is that it really is an event to dine here- my husband liked it way more than I did- partly, I think, because he hadn't read all the info on the courses and was genuinely impressed by what came out. I thought it was all pretty good. A couple of courses (everyone mentions the same ones, for good reason) were amazing, and the rest- pretty good. I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad we tried it once. **Side note: funniest part of the night was when one of our courses that comes... well, sort of balanced on other stuff, slipped off onto the table. The servers all froze, and I swear, the guy who dropped the stuff looked like he was going to go do hara kiri in the kitchen in the back. I think I laughed and said something like ""man overboard!"" because I was trying to ease the tension but I don't think it worked. Poor guy."
51,"[For the full review with pictures, see the link to my blog on my profile.] I thought my plan was foolproof: two months to the calender day as soon as 11am Eastern Time struck, I would call Alinea and presumably have no problem securing a reservation. Well, I was under a misapprehension. It ultimately took 3-5 phone calls per minute for 95 minutes before I finally made it through to a reservationist. I hated the restaurant before I had even crossed the border into Illinois. During my final class of the semester, when the subject of Chicago restaurants surfaced, one of my stats professors mentioned that Alinea delivered the best meal of his life. I found myself struggling to agree with him. It's not the best meal I've had, I said, nor is it the tastiest food I've ever had. But it doesn't need to be because it's the most fun I've ever had in a restaurant tout court. Alinea's impishness is on display from the moment one is seated, as the table's centerpiece is a large block of ice gravid with beet-hibiscus-black licorice juice that becomes a palate cleanser following an aggressively seasoned pure of scallops--intended to mirror tofu, except with flavor, of course--sitting in, inter alia, dashi. With one playful dish after another, the occasional pratfall is bound to occur. And it did, several times. Nothing fell flatter than a utensil-free course of Mangalitsa ham, squid tentacle, orange and fennel, which tasted as if the kitchen had discovered a way to transmogrify orange into a dog's chew toy, making for one of the more unpleasant adventures of the evening. And then there was the edible helium-filled green apple taffy balloon. The balloon is temperature sensitive, and due to the moderate humidity that day, on first delivery one of the balloons shriveled into an unattractive mass, at which point a collective dejection cascaded across the dining room; based on the runner's reaction and how quickly he absconded back to the kitchen, you would have thought he arrived with his pants down. Those lapses can be easily overlooked given the deep-water greatness of several items. After a few introductory courses that amount to throat-clearing exercises, the kitchen demonstrated its ability to walk on water with four courses of outright genius that detonate on your palate unlike anything you've experienced before. It started with a mouthful of spring: four torrid stones holding first of the season morels coated in the feathery baste of beurre mont, asparagus, maitakes, mushroom pure, fried mizuna, and a sixty-three degree quail egg. Next, we'd be treated to an Achatz original: hot potato-cold potato, which leaves your brain trying to conduct an expeditious inventory of details--hot, black truffle-topped Yukon gold potato (check!), cold, velvety potato soup (check!)--as it reconciles two seemingly incongruous sensations. Moving on to what would constitute the main course, first a mirror with sixty ingredients was placed in the middle of the table, soon followed by a plate with three immaculately prepared cuts of lamb: the shank, the saddle and the loin. This almost seemed like the kitchen's way of saying, ""Hey, just in case you thought all we do is play around with gels, hydrocolloids and unconventional plating techniques, check this s*** out."" Spacing out the classics, then came the black truffle explosion, Achatz's successful effort that lasers in on the flavor of black truffle. As if it had been read a sob story, the raviolo gushed forth its black truffle goodness. And despite instructions to seal one's lips tightly, I managed to spray truffle stock half-way across the table. Overseeing this playground was our server Kevin, a hirsute redhead. I had read that service could be on the cold and condescending side, but that certainly wasn't our experience, for everyone who made a pit stop at our table was delightful and most courteous. My one gripe is that while a meal at Alinea will leave one giddy, there's also fatigue that comes with two-and-a-half hours of instructions that precede each course--don't grab the burning end of the cinnamon stick, don't bite down on the metal ball, please don't wait too long to enjoy this dish as it is time sensitive and on it goes--such that there are points where one wonders, ""Is this a restaurant, or am I in the principal's office?"" One final point: it seemed to me that tables were a bit too close to one another. This wouldn't be such a problem if menu length varied by table, as it did several years ago (when the restaurant offered a 26-course option). However, since every table now experiences the same sequence of courses, there's a reasonably high probability that many of the surprises can be sullied if you find yourself gazing in any direction for too long. Notwithstanding these minor quibbles, the food is stunning. It's the equivalent of running a red light over a dozen times and not crashing, and I cannot wait to return the next chance I get."
52,"I had the opportunity to eat at this place last month when I vacationed in Chicago. I don't want to give too much away about the food because honestly you are spending the $$$$ on the experience. Its like someone giving away the ending to a movie you haven't seen. First off the setting. The decor is contemporary. Colors there were a mixture of brown, slate and black The Atmosphere was classy and intimate. Lighting was dim and I almost didn't feel like I was in a restaurant but in someone's rich apartment loft. The noise level there was mild and toned down. I was actually quite surprised how peaceful it was considering the restaurant was full. I guess it was because all the tables were spread out into separate rooms. In each room there were only 3 -4 tables and far apart from each other. People were probably on their best behaviors too. The Service was first class! I felt like a celebrity. Honestly it was like I had my own butler. The gentleman who served us, (don't remember his name, but he had long dark curly hair) was always polite and treated us like kings. He was extremely knowledgeable on every dish. How it was suppose to make you feel, what the food was made of, the history of that food, how to eat it to develop the best savor and what was the inspiration of that dish. It was like watching an artist describe his masterpiece. Some may not like people telling you how to eat your food. But I didn't mind. If you are spending this much $$$$ on your food, don't you want to experience it right to make your moneys worth? You will never use the same utensils twice. When I left to use the restroom, I threw my napkin on the table. I came back to find my napkin folded neatly. When there was a drop of sauce on my table, the waiter came right away to wipe it up for me. The food was creative and so artistic. You almost don't want to eat it because it looked so beautiful. I didn't even know some was edible. My camera phone was snapping shots all night. The thing here is about quality not quantity. So if you are looking for 20 oz steaks, don't come. The food will tickle your 5 senses; smell,sight,touch,taste,and hearing. If you get the wine pairing like I did. Then make that 6; mind. Yes, I got pretty buzzed after 15-1 oz glasses of wine. Remember this is 19 courses so expect to be there for 3 hours. I don't want to give the description of the food away but its nothing you'll find elsewhere. Very molecular gastronomy I would say. Some food were playful while others were a deconstruction of a classic dish. And does it taste good? Hell Yes! I gave this place 4 stars because I did think it was a little expensive. But if you want that once in a lifetime experience then come to Alinea. It's worth it. Lucky getting a reservation though. generally its a 3 month wait."
53,"I had been excited for Alinea for months, but I have to say that my experience was ruined by the waitstaff -- and I left disappointed. The biggest flaw in the evening was how rudely the wait staff treated us when we opted not to get the wine pairings. They attempted to talk us out of it, then pushed a champagne cocktail on to us that we didn't really want. Later, when we each just wanted one glass of wine, the staff lectured us about how difficult it would be to have just one glass of wine since each glass only goes with one dish, and how they could really only properly serve us if we would get the entire wine pairing. I did not get the wine pairing because I wanted to enjoy the experience without getting too tipsy, but the waitstaff made me feel as though I was being cheap. Additionally, when my tablemate did not eat all of the first course because he did not care for roe, the waitstaff loudly made a big scene about asking him why he didn't like it and if there was anything else that he didn't want them to bother bringing out. It embarassed him and, after that interaction, we couldn't help but feel awkward and judged during the meal. Of course, some of the dishes were amazing, such as the taffy balloon and hot potato/cold potato. However, we just couldn't enjoy them in that environment."
54,Yes. Alinea is the big deal that everyone makes it out to be. Words cannot describe the amazing experience you will have there. Video comes close. This is the standard that every restaurant should aspire to.
55,"Of all the places I have been before I can't believe I forgot to review Alinea. What really is there to say though that others haven't? Yes, it was hands down the most incredible, memorable, ""once in a life time"" food experience I have ever had. They were very accomodating to my poultry only/vegetarianism ways. The restaurant is gorgeous, the staff bend over backwards for you ( except the sommelier... he's an obnoxious as*, but from my experiences most are) and there seems to be a surprise at every course. My advice... go in with an open mind and think of it as you're going to the theater, relax and enjoy. Am I running back? No, but not because it wasn't fantastic, but because I'll give it a few years for the chef to come up with some new tricks. It wouldn't be as fun with out the element of surprise. If you haven't been don't let your friends ruin it for you by telling you what to expect ahead of time."
56,"What?! There's only 5 stars? Here's the problem for me with reviewing Alinea. It was probably the most amazing dining experience I've ever had and strangely personal. You can read 5,000 reviews detailing the food (I'm not going to do that here) but you really need to experience it first hand. What I will say is- from when you walk down that hallway and pause before that sliding door to when you hand the valet your ticket for your car to go home- you will have had the most unique experience that is worth every penny. Service- exemplary. We thought for sure the servers were going to be stuffy and all pip-pip. But they were funny and knowledgable. Smartly dressed. We were there a good 4 hours and laughed the whole time. Why is everyone so quiet? Why is there no soft music? I don't know and frankly it doesn't matter. Food- not only did I taste things that blew my mind but VISUALLY things blew me away. It was like eating, art, and performance art...yes it's possible! I loved getting a copy of the menu at the end of the meal! Wine- hmmm beware of the wine pairing. While delicious there is a lot of it. LOTS. Okay fine I had to start giving mine away. Sooo save save saves. GO. If you feel about food the way I do- it will be life changing."
57,"Alinea... Our vacation dinner took place here nearly 4 months ago. However the memories of the flavor profiles still permeate my prefrontal lobe. I do not use the term vacation dinner lightly - this is truly an experience that will transcend culinary predispositions as well as American Express cards. Defining this dining experience is not something I can jot down in a few hundred words in some online review. Rather it is simply the experience of enjoying something that was designed, no destined, to be a work of art. I have eaten from delis, food carts, and extremely fine dining establishments across the United States, this was just distinctly different. My Beautiful Wife - in the awe of interesting meals coming faster than Nordstrom Rack Shoes Clearances, could not stop photographing and commenting on the distinctiveness of each dish. However, I sat awestruck - wondering how someone can sit around and think of an experience remotely similar to this culinary journey. We of course had the staples, 'hot potato - cold potato' and the desert that could easily be described as the next act at Blue Man Group. But it was the detail, no the attention to detail, that had me wondering. Where does Grant get this inspiration? When did the thought putting a pillow of pine-scented air on my table with a beautiful bowl enter his mind? The wine was wondrous. Please don't indulge without it. It should not be an optional component. This interface with the meal was critical to my understanding of the dish as well as my propensity of getting 'more' later on in the evening (thanks Grant!) I can easily close this review by writing a clich that each true ""foodie"" should experience the wonder that is Alinea. What I recommend is, hell, Go - spend the money. I can promise you won't be disappointed."
58,"to get a reservation to the #2 restaurant in America, we had to call exactly 2 months before the date we had hoped to attend. we called them right when they opened at 10am and still had trouble getting through! but when we finally got through and booked our reservation, we knew that it was gonna be soooo worth it clear 3 hours from your night: dress nicely, bring a camera with good macro, and come HUNGRY! and prepare yourself for the most amazing culinary experience of your life. I've read many articles on the famous Alinea and Grant Achatz's ingenuity and creativity but I mostly tried to limit my research because one of the best things about this place is the ELEMENT OF SURPRISE!! so i won't elaborate on each of the 15 courses but i will say that it was AMAZING and well worth the hefty bill :]"
59,"One of the most interesting dining experiences I've ever had. As a going away present to myself (I'm leaving Chicago for lesser of a food paradise), I decided to splurge and go to Alinea with a friend. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, our every need was taken care of. I know the attentiveness and attention to every possible detail should be standard for a restaurant of this caliber, but it was still impressive and I loved being so waited upon!! I won't waste time going in to detail about each of the courses since the menu changes, but I will say that my favorites were 4 bites of seafood served on drift wood, the black truffle explosion (signature dish), and the desert which took up the whole table and is impossible to describe in a way that will do it justice! I will also say that while everything we ate was delicious, it's the unique presentation and the creativity of each dish that really makes this such a fun experience. We also did the wine pairing and it was totally worth the extra $$. Each wine was a great accompaniment to the course(s) and the sommelier, while a bit of a fast talker, was very knowledgeable and gave a great intro to each of the wines. This was by and far the most expensive dinners I've had but also ranks up there with one of the best. The food, the service, the attention lavished upon you as a diner, it all just adds up to a wonderful dinner experience. While I won't be rushing back (wallet needs a break!), I will without a doubt go back again in the future."
60,"A review of the food is not needed. But I wanted to just rave about my experience. Everything (building design, staff, wine pairings and of course food) was exceptional. Non-adventurous eaters need not apply. Seriously, because you'll write a poor undeserving review that will skew the almost perfect 5 star rating."
61,"I really didn't want to write this review, especially because I truly admire chef Achatz, but I decided to share my experience, I think I earned the right at $400 a pop. I was beyond excited to try Alinea, dreaming about it for the last three years, so when I had the chance to fly to Chicago I immediately called to make a reservation. They only had an opening on Sunday at 9:30pm - no problem, I'll take it! One of the servers had a problem though - he seemed to be having a bad day, especially when we chose NOT to get the wine pairing (at $150 extra). When you go to a 3 Michelin star restaurant you expect a magnificent and impeccable service, even if you get the 9:30pm Sunday slot - such service exists - I experienced it at Manresa (a 2 star restaurant). This guy seemed to have gotten offended that we didn't get the pairing, he then went on to give us a ""glass of champagne for us to try and to see if we changed our minds about the tasting - on the house"". We didn't, and he ended up charging for them! Hence the 4 star rating for misleading patrons and for the bad mood. Besides that, the presentation was simply magnificent, well thought out, just incredible. I just wish I could re-experience it again with a great service, I'm sure that it would've tasted much better."
62,"Halfway through the meal, my cheeks started to ache from smiling. We were well into the next morning before the smile finally wore off. The entire evening was a joy. It took a few minutes to get comfortable in the dining room, as the wait staff grossly outnumbered diners and the diamonds from our neighbor's bracelet nearly blinded me. But by course 2 or 3, we had settled in, relaxed and had one of the greatest dining experiences available. Our waiters were all wonderful, each letting themselves be actual people instead of the fine dining waiter-bots you see at some other restaurants. My (many) fears about my relative lack of fanciness were quickly relieved. The food was, of course, spectacular without being overwhelming or needlessly gimmicky. The wine pairing was (drool) so, so good. The dessert was a bit on the tart side for me, but the table was full of fun spring colors so I wasn't complaining... mostly because complaining would have slowed down the shoveling of food into my mouth. Oh, and the after dinner coffee was really good. I think they said it was Intelligensia. Excellent choice. All in, if you have the means, and a solid 4 hours to spare at dinner, put Alinea on the list."
63,"Best meal of my life. Nothing will ever come close, at least until I go to Next. ;) Words cannot describe the genius that one must have in order to pull of what Achatz et al are doing in a hidden spot a few blocks away from DePaul University. Upon walking through the Willy Wonka like entrance (was I having a flashback or was the room shrinking? ) what looked to be like an elevator door actually was the entrance to an experience like no other. We were welcomed.. A genuinely warm welcome and were whisked away to our little table. This is the 3 Michelin star restaurant that many can never replicate 100 times a night. The meal details? No way brutha, you'll just have to experience it yourself. I will say, you MUST fast before the tasting. I can stuff myself but this meal is not easy. To end our night, around 1:30 am Achatz came out to our table, ( only ours ) painted our table top with a gorgeous edible work of art. Then, with a slight look of insanity, he lifted a volleyball sized ball of freshly made chocolate and slammed it on the table. It shattered and like a pinata, freshly prepared desert ""candy"" came out, cotton candy ect. It was a delicious work of art that, and ( thanks to the volume of wine ) looked like a drug deal gone bad. An abstract depiction with raspberry syrup splattered like blood, some stuff that looked like cocaine and enough pink and purple that gave it a post New Years South Beach VIP lounge appearance."
64,"I originally gave 4 stars after rounding from 4.25-4.5 range. After a few other molecular gastronomy focused meals that failed in comparison to this dinner I have decided to round up. See original review for details. PS, next time I am in Chicago I will plan to be back!"
65,"The best restaurant in the United States. I've eaten at almost every Michelin 3-star (and a number of the 1 and 2 stars) and there is simply no comparison. The food, the presentation, the service is all beyond belief. So good. Be prepared for a full night experience and don't make plans later...you are likely only to get a reservation at odd times (5 PM and 9:30 PM were the only choices available to me and I called right when the reservation window opened) and the experience lasted over 3 hours. Also, be prepared that the only thing available is the tasting menu, which was fine by me, but if you like to make choices, go elsewhere. The one negative, in my mind, is the absence of a bar. Only wine is available with dinner. We passed on the wine tasting, which was very pricey for some pretty modest wine selections an ordered an Australian Cab instead, which was still overpriced (hey, it's a Michelin 3-star restaurant, you expect those 200% mark-ups), but a little more reasonable. If you are in Chicago and don't mind dropping $350 a person after taxes and tip, I highly recommend."
66,"Went here last night with my boyfriend - I can't say that the food wasn't impressive because it clearly was. (If you're into the whole gastronomy scene.) But the presentation, staff and atmosphere were completely pretentious and pompous. The arrogant waiters really took away from the experience of our meal. When you pay $700+ for dinner - you expect to be treated like a king/queen not like a pauper by patronizing waiters! One of the waiters argued with my boyfriend about white and black not being a colors because he learned that in 1st grade. My boyfriend then asked him if something he had learned in grammar school went with what an adult male had learned until now. He got really defensive and then never came back to our table. My boyfriend is a loose cannon and can be confrontational with people that try to make him feel like an idiot. The sommelier also gets extremely close to your face while presenting the wine pairings and that was pretty annoying. This place reminds me of some hip club that everyone tries to get into and when you finally do - it blows and you can't wait to leave."
67,"I ate at Alinea again last night, nearly two years after my first visit with a fleeting concern that my second visit wouldn't live up to my first. All but one of the dishes was new - Hot Potato, Cold Potato remained on the menu. They must have listened to my prior review as they picked the right one as their trusty stand-by :) All in all, this experience was even better than my first! 1. We started the meal with Char Roe accompanied by carrot, coconut and curry. This dish is not too memorable. My friend has a salmon allergy, and they substituted Mango for Roe and impressively even printed up her menu with this substitution. 2 - 5. Oyster Leaf, King Crab, Mussel and Razor Clam. Brought out on a piece of driftwood from the ocean, this was one of the more unique presentations. The concept of the Oyster Leaf was unique - the oyster flavor was subtle and more present in the after taste. The Razor Clam was prepared in an Asian sauce of shiso, soy and kaikon and was the winner of these four preparations. Note that it wasn't clear to us until they brought out our printed menus that this was treated as 4 dishes as it seemed we completed our meal a few short of the 19 promised. 6. Wooly Pig served with fennel, orange, and squid. - served on a metal stick and meant to be eaten no-hand's, this again was a unique and fun presentation. The fennel flavor, fortunately, was subtle and worked with the pig and squid. 7. Scallop. Served as a mouse rather than an actual scallop, the scallop flavor could have been stronger. This was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. 8. Ice Beet. The centerpiece on each table is a brick of ice with test tubes filled with a deep purple liquid. During this course, you slurp out the beet juice. If you like beets, this is awesome. 9. Black Sea Bass. This was the most traditional dish served all evening and one of the highlights! This is a healthy portion - a whole fish split between two people. Reviews had said to be careful to not eat too much of this to save room for the rest of the meal. At the end, we wished we had cleaned the bones on this Bass. 10. Hot Potato - as good as I remembered it! The Parmesan and Truffle really make this dish. 11. Wild Mushrooms - I loved this dish but also LOVE mushrooms. 12. Venison - this was another of my favorites. You basically make a cabbage wrap with mustard, bacon, venison, and a few other accompaniments, and the flavors explode in your mouth. 13. Black Truffle - Another masterpiece and debatably as good as Hot Potato. I'm partial to Truffles. 14. Squab - the waiter arranges a bunch of forks and spoons on the table in front of you, one of which has the squab and the rest have different bites to go with it. You eat them one by one, dropping the forks and spoons into a bucket. This dish was more about presentation than substance (though wasn't bad). 15. Anjou Pear served with Brie. I was excited for this dish as love warm Brie. I feel like the Brie could have been stronger as I only tasted the Pear. 16. Ginger. Five small pieces of ginger with varying intensity levels. A nice pallet cleanser. 17. Winter. This was delicious! See the picture for presentation but basically the white ""snow"" was minty and melted in your mouth. So light and refreshing! 18. Balloon. A green apple, helium infused balloon. Fun to talk with helium, especially after all the wine pairings! 19. Dark Chocolate. Much written about, one of the chefs (Grant wasn't in the house) brought out a hollow chocolate ball filled with crackers (?), cotton candy, and more chocolate and smashed it on a table drizzled with three sauces (butternut squash, lingonberry and stout). I would have much, much preferred that the sauces be salted caramel and peanut butter as I am a freak and don't like chocolate and fruit together. Great concept and a fun end to our 3.5 hour experience! My friend and I both had the wine pairings though I asked for ""short"" pours as Alinea has the reputation for pouring heavy, and I wanted to remember all of the meal! Neither of us felt like we had that much wine by the end of the evening, and I wouldn't be scared to get full pours next time! There were a healthy number of sweeter wines. I'm usually not a fan of sweet wine or port but these seemed to work well with the food. In terms of service, what I especially appreciate about Alinea is the lack of pretentiousness of the waitstaff. They're engaging and unobtrusive. My only complaint was when the bill came, we had been charged $16 for a coffee and espresso. Seems a bit steep, no? What separates Alinea from other restaurants of this caliber is the uniqueness in the food and preparation. Pure genious..."
68,Absolutely amazing! One of the best meals I have had in years. It is expensive but worth every penny. I can't think of another restaurant in the US who has created a better experience. Definitely not kid friendly though they did accomodate my son with a special treat. Trust the wait staff. They won't stear you wrong. Can't wait to go back.
69,"I would say this is quite the experience, and for the price it is totally worth it for the food. I dont think there was anything here that I didnt like, though what stood out for me was the venison wrap and the wild mushrooms. I made a reservation on thursday, got a call friday, and was set up for sunday. If you want to dine in here last minute, it is indeed possible if you give it a try. You can read other reviews about the food and service but for me ( who has very tight ""purse strings"") and gets disgruntled if I pay for things that under deliver (esp a $600+ dinner for two), I left in a good mood. The wine pairings are great but really not needed if you are not a heavy wine person. 1 or 2 glasses was all i needed to last me through the experience. Expect to pay 100+ for the various types of pairings though."
70,"We had an anniversary dinner at Alinea last July, so this review is long overdue. I had one of the best meals of my life. I don't remember that much, except the salad we cut ourselves on the table, the three-part pea dish, the pasta hanging on some pole and we wrapped ourselves, and the dessert... Oh did I mention the service is impeccable? I will start calling to make reservation for this fall, I need to make this an annual thing. :)"
71,"The service was excellent and the setting is a very pretty place for an upscale dinner. Some dishes were very memorable (came here in September so listing them out isn't relevant, nor do you get a choice of what to eat so the point is pretty much moot). Presentation was the same- some memorable, some I thought was the chef(s) just trying a bit too hard. There were a few bites I thought were spectacular and a few others that were forgettable. Everything else was in the middle. We did the wine tasting (which was very good but definitely not necessary) and our tab was over $1,000 for two people. I would not go back if I was paying for it, as it was good but not as good as it should have been for the price. Rating breakdown: -1 star for price: while a very tasty and interesting meal, with wine tasting I think the value of the meal is more around $700, not a thousand. My review would've been 4 stars, but: -1 star for sending me out of the restaurant the WRONG way: at the end of the meal we were asked if we wanted coffee or tea. I chose tea. I was very surprised to see a $4 charge on the bill for tea. When paying a thousand-dollar bill, being charged an additional $4 for hot water didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. Just seemed- I don't know, cheap/chintzy. In my opinion this is a very dumb move by them."
72,"Ate at Alinea the same night at David L. and had the same food with three friends. I agree with most of his review. It is technically on point. I break it down like this for those who don't like reading or know much about $700 a person restaurants... If you eat a lot of truffles, Asian street food, animal hearts, sea urchins, and not-so-everyday fruits and vegetables mixed in a juicer, you may find Alinea enjoyable, but not as inspired as advertised. If you don't, you may be in for a bit of a palate shock. For an extremely expensive restaurant, Alinea delivers. By the end of the meal, I found the $150 basic wine pairing (the reserve pairing was $250) along with its accompanying service to be the bargain and maybe highlight of the meal. For me, things broke down into thirds. About a third of the courses were simply inegnious for creativity in presentation. Winter in New Hampshire, the final dessert, and the Ice dish as the centerpiece were brilliant. Another third were straightforward, but delicious. The mushrooms led this category for me. Finally, all the rest were a mix of lacking in creativity or simply good, but not great. Since each night is different, I am curious if others sense the same kind of breakdown when they eat here. The service at Alinea is excellent, though some of our servers seemed happier to be there than others."
73,"If you have the means, and you are actually looking at yelp reviews to decide, stop. Just go. It's an experience. I'm only reviewing to give a word of advice on the wine pairing. We got it, and it definitely boosted our experience, but we were not aware that almost half of the wines were desert wines. Not my favorite. In fact, I get massive headaches. If we had known this ahead of time, I'm sure we would have asked for an abbreviated pairing without the desert wines. I bet they would have done that for us. If not, you really can't go wrong ordering a bottle of champagne to sip throughout the meal. Small sidenote: If anyone went there this fall and took pictures of their food, would you mind sending me a message? I'm trying to make something for my boyfriend for valentine's day, and we were too embarrassed to take a picture of every single course. I'm kicking myself for that."
74,"Each year Restaurant Magazine compiles a Top 100 ranking of the world's best restaurants. In the 2011 edition Alinea came in at number one in North America and number six in the world (the top five venues are all in Europe with the number one ranking awarded to Denmark's Noma). I have yet to dine in any of the top five restaurants, but am having a very hard time envisioning a meal better than the wonderfully creative, phenomenal meal I just enjoyed at Alinea. Imagining food more exquisite is like trying to visualize a color that does not exist. After months of anticipation tonight was my birthday dinner at Alinea. The entrance to Alinea is nondescript and easy to miss. Once you open the unmarked door you stroll down a long modern hallway and eventually are greeted by a host; you are then ushered inside for the start of a magical culinary journey that is far more than just a great meal. Alinea does not just have the best food in the U.S., but likely has the best staff as well. For our four hour long, twenty course meal we were completely pampered by our team of servers. Despite being such a high end venue, there is a fun vibe; the servers (despite being impeccably polished) are laid back, interact with you quite a bit and exhibit wonderful senses of humor; the experience is not at all pretentious as one may imagine. All the staff were great but Johnny in particular stood out as probably the best server we have ever had. Jason deserves kudos as well. My wife does not have the most adventurous palate, but the staff was very flexible with making substitutions. Out of the twenty courses there was not a single dud. About a half dozen of them were so awesome they were mind blowing. Each course has such a unique presentation; the food looks like modern art, but tastes better than any more traditional fare I have consumed. It is hard to do the food justice in a review as the experience of dining at Alinea really exercises all the senses and is a transcending experience; several of the courses even utilize non edible scents to interact with the taste of the cuisine (as well as to evoke memories) such as maple leaves that are scorched, creating the effluvium of burning leaves wafting throughout the dining room. I do not want to describe the courses in detail as being surprised magnifies the experience, but will touch upon a couple of highlights. The first few courses are seafood and the most beautiful was presented on piece of petrified driftwood draped with seaweed and topped with four delicious shellfish dishes artistically doctored up with different flavor components, still sitting inside their shell. The mushroom dish and the venison were my other favorite savories and all the dessert courses were amazing, but the final course - a sort of chocolate pinata broken open at your artistically decorated table (with an assortment of sauces) was out of this world. Alinea does not have a full bar as Chef Achatz believes that hard alcohol would dull one's taste buds to the delicate flavor combinations of the food. There is a fairly large wine list and they offer a standard pairing ($160) or a reserve pairing (about $250) or wines by the glass, bottle and half bottle. While the food is expensive ($210 per/person), there are some reasonably priced wines (bottles start at about $55). My appreciation of fine food far exceeds my appreciation of fine wine and I was not made to feel at all bad for ordering one of the more inexpensive bottles of wine. There are also all sorts of different waters to choose from (including three different sparkling) and at the end of the meal coffee is served in a French press. To cap off our meal we were presented with a copy of the menu and a folder to safely tuck it inside. My wife had made Alinea aware it was my birthday and in addition to serving me an extra dessert course they even had a happy birthday message printed on my copy of the menu. We also were invited for a kitchen tour at the end of the meal and then were escorted outside by a staff member to a waiting taxi. Despite the experience lasting just over four hours it was one I did not want to end, but will take with me many happy memories (and a very full belly). This was truly a meal fit for a king; the most beautiful food I have ever seen, some of the best food I have ever tasted and the best service I have received. I have now had the privilege of enjoying Grant Achatz' three main venues (Alinea, Next and The Aviary); Achatz is an absolute genius and is truly the master of modern cuisine. Someday I would like to try one of the restaurants in Europe that Restaurant Magazine has ranked as superior to Alinea but I am fairly confident that Alinea will remain number one in my book. I would not be surprised if Alinea ascends higher in the rankings before I make it to one of the other venues as I have the feeling that as good as Achatz is now, he is yet to reach his prime and somehow will continue to improve and set new trends."
75,"Dinner at Alinea is probably the craziest meal I've ever had. Really. Throughout the evening, my awe was expressed in many ways: chair dancing, jaw to floor, moaning and groaning, and constant eye rolls of pleasure, just to name a few. There's no way I can come close to describing with any real accuracy the intricacies of this extraordinary experience so I hope you find my photos and commentaries at least entertaining. Here are a few highlights: The table's centerpiece was a live garden. Yes, let's start there. A LIVE garden, on a slab, dirt and all, center of the table. We were instructed not to do anything with it initially, but that it would come into play later in the meal. Understood. First to arrive (that we were allowed to eat) was the steelhead roe with watermellon, kaffir lime and the cutest, teensiest, most delicate little cucumber with the blossom still attached. Adorable. Then a fried morsel on a vanilla bean. It's receptical was built specifically for the mad scientist, himself. Then a massive seaweed platter holding 3 'sea' items. First was an oyster leaf in an oyster shell with a mignonette. That's right. There was actually no oyster at all. Just a leaf in a shell. Tricky. Then a raw scallop with an ale and old bay foam. Increadibly more delicious than I can convey. Then my first ever razor clam also with deliciousness too complicated to describe. Next was this little stick. It was made from the skin that forms on the top of the 'whey' of tofu. They peeled it off and deep fried it, then wrapped it with a wonderfully sweet prawn, rolled it in sesame seeds and stuck it in a fancy aioli. Who thinks of this stuff? Then the English peas three ways. When this 'bowl' arrived, it was hot and cold all at once. You start with the top... Then open it up to find the freeze dried stuff with olive oil blobs and grapes... Then remove that section to discover a silky-smooth puree. Unlike any pea soup I've ever had... I got quite excited for the next course when the marked our table with a pair of scissors. I knew I was going to get to snip away at that center piece. I was right. We added the baby chard, mizuna, thai basil, cilantro and more to our tomato heaven. It was like eating soup and salad at the same time. The flavor of the broth alone may have taken the cake for my fave course, and then add the fact that I get to play with my food by adding LIVE lettuces and herbs snipped from our own table garden?! Whaaaaa?!!! This is what they like to call ""hands-free"" dining. It's one little bite on a skewer that you simply remove with your mouth. Yeah. Fun. Less important were the ingredients: Mackerel, mango, bergamot flower and who knows what else. Then a little mushroom garden with a cream infused with pine (yes, pine... as in 'cone') and a bunch of other interesting ingredients. I think they were going for a forest-in-your-mouth sensation. Success. Oh! And then there was ""hot potato, cold potato"". A warm, creamy potato soup with a mini 'cold potato' on which a slice of black truffle rested. There was also a little cube of butter and parm on the mini skewer which melted into the soup upon removing the skewer from its resting place. All carefully dropped into the soup which was then gulped from the little bowl. This one was fun too. Here's the fanciest little lamb dish you'll ever see. I can't tell you all of the components but I can tell you that this was one to merit the chair dance. Wonderful! A favorite at the table (and amongst Achatz followers) was the ""Truffle Explosion"". A one bite raviolo filled with juicy truffle heaven. It rested on a spoon that sat in a bowl that had no bottom. Yes, a bowl built only to hold a spoon. The garnish is a tiny romaine leaf, black truffle and shaved parm. Ridiculously delicious. Here's a whacky one. First, remove the glass plate containing a bunch of little garnishes like blackberry, fermented garlic and olives from its base. Then construct a devise with the tools provided on which to hang the pasta that was somehow snuck to your table in the form of a second center piece. Fill the pasta with decadent braised short ribs and strange garnishes of your choosing before wrapping it up and eating it like a taco. See, I told you it was whacky. You can barely see the little octopus tentacle resting next to a smooth, set eggplant puree with coriander and more. Take the bite then wash it down with the frothiness in the bowl. This was the intermezzo to clear the palatte. Coconut snow with yuzu. Just don't lick it directly from the frozen metal or you'll end up like Ralphy from ""A Christmas Story"". Ouch. I loved this course, too! All kinds of crazy stuff that a normal person would never pair. There were squares of peach puree, basil, balsamic, jasmine, mozzarella, creme fraiche! I was like a kid in a candy store... I had so much fun mixing and matching flavors and textures! Full review on blog."
76,"THis place is really different. It was like 19? courses when I went. I can't believe it used to be 26. Anyhow, it's not so much a meal, as it is an interactive experience. Some of the dishes require you to put in a little work not a lot, to put it together. Everything is pretty small. THe most impressive part was the dessert, which they make onto (literally) your table, and you eat if off there. So you should go here under the following conditions: Big time foodie (not me) Super special occasion like anniversary or getting married or something (again not me) Really really rich with nothing better to do (not me) Friend has a gift certificate and you're going to be moving out of CHicago soon (me) Anyhow, surprisingly laid back, I thought it'd be super uptight, I felt like I was just in someone's really fancy contemporary home. I had a good time. Didn't try any cocktails other than their juice, so I can't really comment on that. The only downside is I was still kind of hungry afterwards and ate when I got home, although I eat a lot. Also it's expensive at 200, although for ultra fine dining it's pretty low. Make a reservation wayy way way in advance."
77,"FH and I ate here last Saturday for our 7th anniversary. Note that I made reservations on January 3rd or some shit. All I can say is that it was fan-freaking-tastic and I can't wait to come back. The menu was inspired and in no way gimmicky, which was what I thought I might think. It's hard for me to pick a favorite thing that we ate. The venison goulash was cray cray. There was a whole roasted fish served with caponata and shit, which was old school and scrumptious. Basically everything was crazeballs in the best way ever and the wine pairings were TOTES worth it. That all being said, the dinner with pairings, tax, and tip, cost more than our flat screen TV. Just saying."
78,"I'm not going to go into too much detail about the dishes. Part of Alinea's appeal is the element of surprise. Centerpieces come and go, each anticipating some later dish to come but temporarily remaining enigmatic and vaguely inorganic objects vaguely conceivable as food. Things like Hot Potato Cold Potato and the Black Truffle Explosion are standard on the menu, but there remain many more spots throughout the twenty-ish courses for novel permutations of flavors. The wait staff is immaculately attentative and do a good job throughout the meal of offering explanations and backstories as to the chef's inspiration and intended concept. What I really enjoyed about Chef Achatz's cuisine was that, besides being obviously avant-garde and exquisite, it's really just quite tasty. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, but at the end of the day I still tend to usually prefer food that's more on the comfort-food end of the spectrum. Despite the inventive presentation and combinations of flavors, many of the dishes I sampled here during my meal thrust forth flavors that were ultimately quite fundamental and familiar. Chef Achatz manages to retain essentially the heart and soul of many various cuisines from around the world and convey some core essence of the food despite dressing it up in his particular style. There was nothing on my menu that I thought was particularly out-there in terms of its flavor notes, but days after my meal I'm still thinking about and craving this or that dish. Beyond the hype and aesthetics Alinea also excels at the substance of food, cooking each morsel to perfection and deftly distilling its flavor notes to a pure and robust core. If such a thing as a food high exists, Alinea provides it in spades. My experience was lovely in every way, and I can't wait to come back again."
79,"I am a bit new to the world of ultra high-end dining, but Alinea was a truly special experience. Every course was excellent, many were unforgettable. In addition, dinner at Alinea is part theater part meal. Nearly every course is presented in an elaborate, clever, and playful way. At many restaurants I would disdain such gimmickry, but Alinea pulls it off and then some. The quality and flavor of the food does not suffer one bit due to such flare. Favorite course were the black truffle explosion (an impossibly rich, single bite, ravioli filled with a black truffle emulsion), winter in New Hampshire (a beautiful presentation of peppermint snow topped with a few sweet bites) and a fish dish served family style. I may never eat a more inventive or delicious meal in my life. That said, I believe the food to be EVERY bit as good at Charlie Trotters (my other high end dining experience), minus a bit of the wizardry that makes Alinea special and at a slightly lower price. I highly recommend a trip there before it closes later this year. Service was impeccable, one anecdote can explain it all. I spilled a tiny drop of syrup from the dessert course on my jacket cuff. I noticed it, and started dabbing it with my napkin. Without me saying a word, and within SECONDS, a waiter produced a shout wipe and presented it to me on a plate with another napkin. Very impressive. The atmosphere of the place was really cool, modern decor, soft colorful lighting, and beautiful architecture. We got a peek at the kitchen after dinner, and it was amazing to think that 20 amazing courses come from such a small room. Really cool to see the chefs at work for a few minutes. I did do the wine paring (my companions did not). All the wine was great, but I am a bit of a novice when it comes to wine and I am not sure it was worth it (for me). Next time I might just split a good bottle or two."
80,"For being the sixth ranked restaurant in the world, Alinea of course delivers top notch creative foods that were mind boggling for the regular diners. I had my highs and lows of my experience there. However, if you're going to spend over $300 on food, do check my complete report http://www.thingsonmytop All in all, I would come back there again, not anytime soon. Maybe, sometime when they change their menu and I have more money to spare."
81,"I can't really say anything here that hasn't already been said. Simply put, my experience at Alinea was incredible. Every bite had SO much thought put into it. From Black Truffle Explosion (yes, it really is as good as they say), to the Balloon dessert, every course was perfect. As we were leaving, I found myself immensely jealous of everyone still dining who didn't know what courses were to come. I wished I could rewind the clock 3 hours and do it again!"
82,"ABSOLUTELY a meal to DIE for! On Feb 1st 2011, my husband called Alinea during the blizzard, I was in surgery and as soon as I came out - he called and made the reservation for my birthday, April 3rd. I had been wanting to go here for a while - and we kept missing the dates....so he made sure to get us in. We almost passed the restaurant on the street, because it is so well hidden - and it SHOULD be! Loved walking in and feeling as though we were part of some special secret that no one else knew about! The artworks are stunning and nothing is over the top - everything is gorgeous! It was cozy and fun - and just as much of a treat watching and hearing other people as they received new courses. From the playfulness and whimsy to the absolute perfection in food - this was just one of my favorite meals of all time. They also realized I had not taken a picture of one of the courses - I was doing this to remember them - and they brought us both another of that course - just to be nice! Spectacular! My husband also recorded the desert process!!! I don't want to spoil any part of this meal by saying ""we had this"" - so just GO and LOVE IT! We also celebrated and paired with the reserve wine pairing - costly - but a once in a lifetime treat. I am sure that when we go back - we will do the regular pairing just for the cost savings - but they did not EVER skimp on the wine - and we are talking some very rare vintages, etc. The glassware rocked! I felt special the entire time we were there - and do plan to make sure to go back for other special events.....h'mmmmm....there are some birthdays coming up! :0)"
83,"Recommended by a friend to come, I decided to try to fit it in on my next visit home to Madison. Clearly if it was good enough for her to fly from New York to Chicago just for one meal, I needed to try this place for myself. After calling over 200 times in 45 minutes before finally getting a ring tone, I finally was able to make my long awaited reservation. Mind you this was at the beginning of December, my reservation was for February. Having not been home in almost two years, I lured my extremely Asian parents (meaning their idea of a fancy dinner is a meal at Olive Garden, anything beyond that is unnecessary) here on the basis of it being my baby sister's birthday. They began our meal by greeting us and wishing my sister a happy birthday. Although their names escape me now, the waiters we had were all great. I was a little worried at the beginning about the stuffiness, but they warmed up, were funny and definitely added some wittiness to each dish. They also set aside a special dish for the birthday girl, a creative dessert involving the unwrapping of a present and chocolate and warm cream? which she thoroughly enjoyed. The meal was spectacular and even my parents thought so (WINNN!). Everything was clearly incredibly well thought out and without a doubt, an experience unlike any other. The highlights of the meal were the Yuba, King Crab, Wild Mushrooms, Hot Potato and Dark Chocolate. The only thing I did not enjoy was the Oyster Leaf, the fishiness of it was really unpleasant although I do understand what they were aiming for. The price is quite steep as would be expected but in my mind well worth it. Dinner at Alinea is an adventure anyone with even the slightest appreciation for food should experience."
84,"I had high expectations for this place and I must say, it met my expectations (but didn't exceed them). They put lots of thought into the food and our overall experience while we were eating. I was also pretty surprised at some of the things they could do to food! The tasting menu was 19 courses (with optional 20th course you could add to your experience. Some memorable dishes: Beet soup in a large block of ice Leaf that tastes like oyster Making dashi in front of us Yuba wrapped in shrimp with red miso dipping sauce Turning a scallop into tofu Very very tender and yummy swordfish (usually I think swordfish is tough but this one was the best I've had!) Mushroom dish where the plate sits on top of a pillow and slowly sinks down, compressing juniper scent at you. Supposed to mimic you walking through the woods smelling juniper and picking mushrooms This explosion of black truffle goodness set on an ""antiplate"" Meal set on utensils in a random array all over the table (inspired by Miro)--This bucket in the middle gave off lavender scent as you are eating Crispy brie and apple on a lit cinnamon stick (playing with smell as you're eating again) Snow flavored into peppermint and CLEAR hot chocolate! Desert where a chef comes out and plates the table in front of us! This place is definitely worth it!! Everything was presented to me so artistically. The food also tasted great! They also tried to involve me in some parts (like doing certain things to food or assembling parts of the dinnerware). I may consider coming here some other time...some other season :D"
85,"Alinea is a one of a kind, once in a lifetime (if you're lucky and enought of a foodie to spend the bucks) exoerience. We managed to get in while visiting Chicago last November on a waitlist for a Wednesday night. Fortunately for us, someone canceled their 9:30PM reservations and we snapped them up without a second thought. To start, entering Alinea is like entering someplace out of a Tim Burton movie. It is very Wonka-esque and a hint at the irreverence of what lies ahead. Alinea is in fact, theater as much as food - interactive, innovative and entirely fun. They offer one menu only, a tasting menu with the selection of 2 different wine parings, a standard pairing and a reserve. My advice to you, go all the way. You will not regret it. I will not go through each course as enough have already done that, but like others have said, all of the courses are outstanding, while several are unforgettable and they are all incredibly innovative and your participation is required. We left Alinea feeling completely satisfied and completely delighted. The meal and the experience was completely worth the price of admission. If I had to pick which was the ""better"" meal, Alinea's or The French Laundry, I would, and am, declining to choose. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum, both executed flawlessly. They are my 2 favorite meals of all time. If I had any disspointment with Alinea at all, it is that Chef Achatz, who was in the kitchen on the evening we dined, left for the night before I thought to ask to get a picture with him. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to go back..."
86,"I've delayed, and delayed writing this review. Because once I write it, the journey truly comes to an end. Okay, I'm being overly dramatic. If you decide to dine here, I would recommend making a special weekend out of it. I realize my review hasn't even gotten to talking about the meal, but build up to it by doing the following: - Go to the Art Institute - Visit a modern furniture store - Have a light lunch of a small sandwich We built an entire weekend around an appreciation of art and its process, and that's really what Alinea is. I mean, the crazy amount of ingredients in each dish is enough to leave your head spinning. I'm very grateful for the waiters who I think really add to the experience. Have fun, keep guessing. No need to panic about remembering what you ate, they'll give you a menu at the end. And don't blink at the bill even though it was the most expensive meal I'd ever had in my life so far. My photos can do more of the talking. No flash though, so I'm glad I brought my DSLR but the macro lens doesn't handle low light that well."
87,"Most amazing meal I've ever had. My boyfriend surprised with me dinner at Alinea for my birthday this year and it couldn't have been a better evening. The atmosphere for our 9:30pm reservation on a Wednesday night was perfect: the servers were attentive, the dining room wasn't too loud so we could enjoy our conversation; it was the perfect setting. Our first plate was Char Roe with carrot, coconut and curry. We about fell out of our seats; it was so simple yet amazingly delicious. Other note-worthy plates include: Ice with beet, hibiscus and licorice The black truffle explosion Winter in New Hampshire Hot potato/Cold potato Razor clam with shiso, soy and dalkon Lemongrass with papaya, thai basil and finger lime By the time we got to the awesome dessert presentation we were feeling quite full, but we couldn't pass up the last course. It was so much fun, like being a kid again, eating off the table but in a more sophisticated style! Everything went perfect. For sure the best birthday meal ever."
88,"I've been 3 times now. A truly unique experience. While not everything will be a home run, there is a strong focus on the taste of the food and not just doing something different for the sake of being different."
89,"I was looking forward to this for a long time and almost never does something so anticipated live up to expectations. This time , expectations were exceeded. It was like Cirque de Soleil on our plates. Plus almost everything was delectable. The staff were only slightly snooty. My recommendation: get the earliest reservation possible , or wear blinders or try to look down if other diners get their courses before you. The surprise of each dish is at least half the fun. It was the most we've ever spent for dinner by far ($775 including one wine pairing but I say it was worth it!)"
90,"What can I say that other reviews haven't? 1. Proposed to my GF of 12 years here (hopefully we'll be able to come here every year on our anniversary.......at least that's my plan). 2. Food exceeded my high expectations. 3. Service exceeded my high expectations. 4. If you must, pimp yourself out to highest bidder to pay for dinner."
91,"Maybe four and a half would be more appropriate. I can say that even with the hype and price tag, Alinea did not let me down. We were fortunate enough to get placed on the wait list on a Tuesday and received a call back for dinner that Thursday night at 10:00. Based on my eavesdropping, there were a few tables in from out of town that had much more difficulty getting a reservation. The evening started a little oddly as the person that seated us was a bit pushy in trying to get us to do the wine tasting and kind of steered my wife into ordering one of their cocktails. Since we both had early mornings the next day, we opted against the pairing. At that point, I just asked for a beer and got the stink eye. They honestly made it seem like they had one beer left somewhere and that they would kindly dust it off for me. Thank you for my $12 dusty beer! Luckily, things picked up after that. The dishes have all been pretty documented. I will say that the seafood plate, the potato soup, and the truffle explosion were very memorable. Some others were just ok. There were two that I could take or leave. All in all, I'm glad we came. As the night wore on, I think the servers loosened up and made it feel less formal and more fun. We definitely had a great time. I thikn if you're considering trying it out, just go. It's an experience."
92,"Alinea is a high cuisine molecular gastronomy restaurant, so if you order soup it could come freeze dried or in a cube. This was my first experience of eating at a molecular gastronomy restaurant so I was very interested to see how the food was prepared and how it tasted and none of it is what I expected. You might as well throw out every idea of a normal idea of going to a restaurant. It's location, near the Steppenwolf theatre is in a nice area of the city, it's formal attire, and of course, the only shirt I brought with me to Chicago doesn't close at the neck, but as it's a fancy shirt I get away with the tie and unbuttoned neckline. All staff are finely dressed and we were seated at a black wooden table with very comfy upholstered chairs. There is a pumpkin in the middle of the table. We were told we weren't getting a menu until after the meal. So there was no ""I'll have the fish"" you don't order here, you get what your given. After a quick check that none of us have any allergies the meal arrives in 3 hours (yes 3 hours!) worth of molecular constructed courses. After drinks orders we are told that the first course is already in front of us, the waiter lifts up the pumpkin and underneath is our first course, an amuse bouche of pumpkin, curry sage and coconut. After this we get a wooden block full of seaweed with 4 sea shell on top all with different things. We are told the recommended order in which to eat them and also that all should be taken in one bite. Over the course of the next 3 hours many different dishes in different formats arrive, so much that I can't in my semi jet-lagged state can hardly keep up with (and this review would go on forever!!). At one point a glass chemical pot is placed in the middle of the table and a Bunsen burner placed underneath, we are told by the waiter he's not allowed say anymore. The water at the bottle of the jar is boiled and goes up a tube to the top of the jar which has a a variety of vegetables. The water suddenly drops down to the bottom jar and this is repeated while we dine on other courses. Eventually we are given a tofu scallop and the waiter takes out the bottom jar and pours it on the tofu, this is the broth for the dish. There is a ""hands free"" dish which is set on the top of an antenna you suck off, some fried pigeon on the bottom of a branch with the leaves a little burnt to give an Autumn aroma, red cabbage leaves are left sitting in the middle of the table, very unappetising looking, as the waiter says ""looks like a sliced section of a brain."" This eventually turns out to be the cabbage leaf in which other components are wrapped in. A mushroom dish was brought out on a pillow which had a scent of pine to give the feel of being in the woods. One dish came on a assortment of forks and spoons designed into the shape of a leaf on the table, and you ate one fork/spoon at the time. One you suck out of a test-tube which surprises us all by bolting into our mouths. The finale though, was something else. We were given yuzu in a metal cone the texture of snow to clean our palettes. A dish of squares on a plate was the first dessert course. We are encouraged the mix and match the squares. One square is pear, another balsamic vinegar, I think there was an olive in there somewhere. Then the waiters come out and put a tablecloth down. A jar with liquid nitrogen is brought our and a chocolate dome and 3 dishes of sauces. Two of the chefs come out and start saucing the tablecloth. The liquid nitrogen is poured into the chocolate domes and the chefs smash the domes in the middle of the table. Inside there's butternut squash, pumpkin, cotton candy and god knows what else. You mix with the sauces. The taste of the food in general was exquisite, some better than others. Some to me just tasted chemically. Others like the pigeon and the dessert, were astounding. And it's not just about the food at Alinea. It's a show, it's a performance with food as the main character. This is cuisine on the edge. If you are starving and need a good satisfying dinner get yourself a steak somewhere, but if you want a completely unique dining experience this place is an experience. I won't mention the bill as I wasn't the one paying, but the cost of a meal for 4 was substantial."
93,"***Alinea is truly a one-of-a-kind experience; while I enjoyed the food, Alinea works better as an ""experience"" rather than a ""meal,"" which makes it (for me at least) one to go to once but maybe not one that I must seek out again*** Alinea is considered one of the best restaurants in the country. Alinea specializes in progressive cuisine (molecular gastronomy), but it one-ups similar places (like The Bazaar and Baume) by not only playing around with how the food is cooked (but also how the diner experiences it). Alinea has a set tasting menu with many courses and chef Grant Achatz shows incredible range by highlighting how he can put out fresh and vibrant Californian-like flavors (steelhead roe with watermelon, kaffir lime, cucumber blossom), classical flavor combinations with strong cooking technique (morels and hon shimeji mushrooms with cream and a red wine reduction), and creative interpretations on traditional dishes (like the peach, basil, burrata, balsamic, and almond plate, which combines the elements of a great salad, cheese plate and dessert all into one). There were other great things as well. There was dehydrated yuba (tofu skin) that was wrapped with shrimp, miso and sesame seeds. The crispy texture and flavor were both pleasing. Another great dish was their farm salad, which was also a clever presentation. There was a base of tomatoes (very fresh) and gazpacho (very tangy) that also came with goat cheese, carrot and red onion. The table's centerpiece (a herb and greens garden) was used for the salad as you snip desired herbs/greens and then mix into the salad. I wished though that they didn't alter the goat cheese. They must have freezed it or something to give it a different texture. Unfortunately, it wasn't really a texture improvement. It came across like cold goat cheese that had been in the cold part of the refrigerator too long and thus not in harmony with the other ingredients. Similar to the farm salad, the short rib pasta combined both a playful presentation as well as an interactive approach. You dress the pasta sheet yourself with the many ingredients provided (olives, garlic, blackberry, smoked salt). The flavors were strong and the beef was tender, juicy and savory. The meal could have used more meat though. They did this one dish called (agneau), which was very dainty portions of meat (lamb I think) that came with crispy potatoes and a rich sauce. The combination of ingredients produced a satisfying flavor, but the meat was dry (in addition to being very small). Unfortunately, it was the only other meat dish and it did not have the impact of other meat dishes I've had at similar restaurants. They did a lot of seafood dishes though and they were good. There was a nice scallop in a light broth as well as razor clams in XO sauce (a spicy-sweet-salty Asian sauce). There was some moist mackerel that was made very fragrant with the addition of juniper as well as a fritter of hamachi (made fragrant with a vanilla bean). A lot of the other items were small bites and all of them were at the very least good (with some of them standing out more than others). The black truffle explosion ravioli was good and flavorful (even if the pasta was a little too thick). I also liked their lemongrass shooter with gelee, dragronfruit, Thai basil, and lime. Pricing was high, but Alinea is a one-of-a-kind experience. Still, despite the many-many courses, I left a little bit hungry. The experience was very satisfying, but when just considering this as a meal, I did not leave Alinea as content as I did after my visits to Ria or Avenues. Service was incredibly professional and polite (as well as unbelievably meticulous with immediate recognition of diner needs), but it was a little too formal for my taste. The formal service here seemed consistent with other Chicago fine dining spots so it might just be a difference between West Coast dining and Chicago dining. The service also seemed a little too rehearsed for me. It probably guarantees a consistently excellent service experience, but I prefer waiters/waitresses/servers who can identify customer preferences and thus customize the experience for each diner (Baume, The Restaurant at Meadowood, and The Village Pub are great at accomplishing this). In the end, the service though is very strong and the food has a big wow factor. Alinea provided an experience unlike any I've ever had at a restaurant (or expect to have in the future). And this makes Alinea a must visit if you love food (and even worth a special trip to Chicago). But you should consider extending your trip because there is no shortage of very good restaurants in Chicago. Valet parking is available. Street parking also seems to be available."
94,"No matter who you are or what your experience at Alinea, the food stands alone in excellence. SO, despite us being a little disappointed in our dinner, I recognize that the expectation was SO HIGH, that Alinea could have never met it. Also: be prepared for price. Our dinner was $1100 when it was all said and done. 5 stars all the way for the food and knowledge of the wait staff. Incredible. Few rules to follow: 1. Keep your imagination in check! The food is great, but it won't change your life. 2. Wine pairing: STAY AWAY!! It's not worth the price, especially for the Reserve Pairing which we opted for. Fellow Yelpers were spot-on with this. 3. Don't come with alot of conversation topics for your fellow diners: The atmosphere is very quiet, and somewhat cold. Focus on the food and you'll be good to go. I will never go back to Alinea, because frankly I cannot afford it, but I'm so happy we chose to experience it once in our lives."
95,"Going to try to keep this short. Alinea is an experience with food like I've never had before. Every course was magical...each one escalating into taste bud ecstasy all the way until the finale. Everything was so artfully done; beautiful to see and taste. I have never seen or tasted anything like the food here. Not only were there delicious foods to be eaten, but curious scents and lovely wines to be had. (we did the wine pairing with the food, and I'm glad we did!) I loved the lengthy meal, conversation and atmosphere. I didn't want my 4 hour eating extravaganza to end. My taste buds and belly were left in awe, not wanting to try another food again. Some food highlights: Everything was so festive for fall! -Pheasant + apples + fried dough + cinnamon--a bite of heaven I wish I had more of -Venison and cabbage burrito -Black truffle explosion -Hot potato Cold potato -Chocolate pinata...and epic dessert served to us by the man himself! The service was also a big part of the evening. Everything was choreographed perfectly. Dinner had an excellent rhythm. Each server brought their own personality to the table, and it was fun to hear their explanations of the food and wine. They kept the service playful--nothing was taken too seriously. Made the whole situation of dining at an expensive restaurant more comfortable. One of our earlier food courses that involved driftwood and shellfish was messed up 2 times (dropped a piece on our table) and they had to redo the presentation for us to make it perfect. I thought this was silly, but they insisted. Third time was a charm! Anyway, I wish I could afford to come back here again during a different season. I hope to be back in my lifetime! I recommend this place to anyone who loves food, art, long meals (3+ hours), and a truly awesome night."
96,"Molecular Gastronomy. Overall, don't expect hearty meals. Instead, expect art, presentation, and contrasting flavors that blends. Whether it's the way the food was cooked in front of you, how things bubble, or the contrasting temperature between hot and cold that plays with the taste buds, the whole Alinea experience is definitely AN EXPERIENCE. Three hours of fantastic dining, 18 experimental courses later, and over $700+ for the two taster menu and one wine pairing, I would have to recommend Alinea to any foodie out there. Is it worth the price tag? Debatable. But hey, you will ONLY EAT HERE ONCE, right? Or at least we will. It in no way can be compared to the hearty big portions at some of the other fine dining establishments, but just for the experience, it's worth a try. We won't come back, but you should go!"
97,"There are a bunch of other reviews that will get super technical, but I'll just share what I remember sitting here a month after my meal at Alinea. 1)Our ressie was at 530, we walked out about 8 so give yourself time. This seems bizarre, but even with 22 courses, you don't walk out overly stuffed. It's feeling satiated but not uncomfortably so. 2) The hot potato,cold potato truffle course was SO FREAKING AMAZING. The Frozen Yuzu was also amazing. Thanks Grant, for ruining my life. If only I could get Yuzu italian Ice on demand. 3) I get it; it's stuffy. But if you aren't, the staff will chill out and give some personality back! They are still beyond professional, but they're human! I know there were like 10 people waiting on us, but they were pretty funny and laughed with us when we didn't know how to eat some of the things we were served. All in all, definitely the best meal of my life (based on food alone. Mama's Fishhouse in Hawaii will forever hold the title because it's Maui)."
98,"Had read a book about celebrity chefs and Grant was one of the chefs they focused on. It is amazing, young dude can be so clever. Unfortunately, he was not there the night we visited which was May 4th my dad and L's son's birthday. My dad was bragging how his new wife fiance was taking him there. I am thinking to myself, sure surprise see you in two days. My dad almost cried when he saw I was there before him. So, it ended up being $2600 for 6 people. My dads fiance at the time wanted me to pay for the bill. I have never paid for my dads dinner as he is wealthy, I am not. So, I had my dads company card since I work for him. We tried to count how many courses we were at as we did the 24 courses. We lost track at 18. For me, it was nerve wracking not being that bright trying to figure out how to put things together. Think of it as a scientific food experiment. Is it as good as French Laundry? Yes, the waitstaff is super knowledgeable at Fl, which makes the service slightly better if you get a laugh out of the formalness as L and I do. We were there until 230 but not the last table. Grant was not there because, he was getting a James Beard award. The kichen is spotless. The wine list is not as priced as nigh as French Laundry. It was a memorable night to be at the #7 restaurant in the world. Well, worth it. Funny to me, how those in Chicago may not even know of Alinea."
99,"Curiously, the top restaurant in the US (2010/2011) lies in the quaint and unpretentious neighbourhood of Lincoln Park. The only tell-tale sign was the valet notice and doorman standing by the bare doors. I was greeted by a narrow neon red hallway and my world was suddenly transformed once the metal doors opened. The hostesses and servers operated seamlessly. After reconfirming our lack of dietary restrictions, our courses came promptly, one after another. All 20 of it. A set of 3 cocktail amuse bouche opened our tastebuds. A cooling sour lemon with sweet grapefruit, a spoonful of apple brandy hard jello and a shot on a stool of squash with foam on top. Each one seems to be progressively stronger in alcohol taste. The GOLDEN TROUT ROE had light coconut flavours , and the zest of tangy-sweet pineapple. What an interesting and unique combination of flavor that will always remind me of Chef Achatz! The Japanese inspired YUBA was a long crunchy twig that was wrapped with shrimp, sprinkled with sesame seeds and dipped with miso. Presented alongside with the Vietnamese inspired CHAO TOM which is a sugar cane cube infused with shrimp broth, topped with mint and chewed until the flavours are extracted. A beautiful twist to the traditional Vietnamese dish! The STRIPED BASS was complimented perfectly with sweet vanilla froth and sourness. A pinch of black pepper and sesame, along with the light crackers gives it the crunch that contrasts flawlessly with the supple fish. A shot of CELERY JUICE held a shell of horseradish ball encasing apple juice. What an exotic flavor from everyday fruit and vegetable! The horseradish was slightly spicy like wasabi (which is made of horseradish) and the celery juice and apple juice mixed well together. A distinctive three layered dish of RABBIT Top layer; eat it like a parfait, a sheet of squash and pine nuts were accompanied by thin crunchy stems. Then rabbit rillette was accompanied by balls of potatoes? Afterwards, sip on the consomm made from the rich broth that soaked the cinnamon stick. Unfortunately, I thought this was a little salty for my liking. A smoky aroma filled the room; it was from the burning fig that held the PHEASANT TEMPURA with walnuts together. Light crunch, very unique and the pheasant was very tender but I'm not a big fan of walnuts. One of the most interesting dish was the create-your-own SHORT-RIB RAVIOLI with a variety ingredients of your choice! Including sea salt, olives, blackberry, onion etc. I made sure to put everything in my wrap. It was delicious, and the chilled pasta wrap was warmed by the slow braised short rib. The creativity and hands on experience does not end here! Next up was a shot of temperature sensitive POTATO with black truffle. Warm truffle paired with icy cold potato and mushroom. What a scrumptious sensation! Then our server poured us a GRAPE SODA to match with the extremely tender PIGEONNEAU on a light puff pastry. BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION blew up in my mouth! Keep your lips shut for this as you don't want luscious rich truffle spilling out of your lips! Cheesy, creamy truffle. MMM! A spoonful was delectable and satisfying. To pave the way to desserts, an unusual sweet-savory set of three came. A PINEAPPLE SUGAR SHEET dusted with ham flavoured powder. Be sure to eat it with the powder facing up and you'll keep the table powder-free! Slightly sugary, more savory. A crispy bacon glazed with butterscotch and a cup of liquefied caramel popcorn made a sweet drink. An exquisite transition from main course to dessert! An inflated pillow infused with earl grey permeated the room while we cut up EARL GREY COOKIE topped with white chocolate and crunchy strips. My favourite dessert is the tube of bubble gum flavoured CREME FRAICHE. Jelly like in the tube, suck it out and all three layers combined. A chewy consistency of mini tapioca balls and fruity-bubblegum flavoured. Ending the night was the full blown dessert, a CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM frozen by liquid nitrogen. Surrounded by huckleberries, nougat and a dollop of vanilla cream. The crisp sheet decorating the final piece stood out from the soft and cooling ice cream. Service was impeccable. Napkins replaced, water droplets and crumbs wiped off, each course explained thoroughly, and came and left in a syncronised fashion, gracefully and efficiently. *** Tip: Business formal dress code suggested. We made reservations at least a month in advance. Cancellation costs $100 per person! Tasting menu was not that filling but still left me about 80% full. I liked being there at 5pm because we were the first ones to get seated and we were the first ones to get our food. Favourites: Very friendly service, not pretentious at all. Expensive but not disgustingly unaffordable. Do not want: I wanted a little more red meat =p Last words: What an EXPERIENCE!"
100,"This was an incredible experience; 5 stars from start to finish. The standouts for me were the Burn Morels, Lamb, Anjou Pear, Blueberry, Balloon, and White Chocolate. I could never do justice and describe the food so I'm just summarizing. My group and I each did the wine pairing, with one of us choosing the Reserve option. The latter option didn't seem to be worth the additional price. There were only 3 wines that were different. Besides that, there is nothing else to say about our time at Alinea other than that the entire time was decadent and unforgettable."
101,"Alinea, Alinea, Alinea. This place is beyond excellent. Words simply can't describe how superb the food in Alinea is! I have had so far the BEST dining experience in my life. I've been to quite a few michelin starred restaurants previously such as French Laundry, Chez Dominique, Village Pub, Spruce, Lumiere, L2O, etc. These were very good restaurants. However, Alinea has really brought food, and good food to a different level. The courses themselves were tasty and mind-blowing. Further, they made the whole dining experience very unique and seamless. First, they had completely avant garde ways of presenting food by going beyond the conventional utensils such as forks and knives. They would serve food on seaweeds, a tube, and a rack, etc. (yes, I did say a tube). All these would become gimmicks if the food themselves were lackluster. However, the food was incredible! Chef Achatz and his team really know how to play with texture, flavor and temperature. I can spend the whole day talking about each course, there're a few really stood out in terms of contrasting different textures, flavors, and temperatures. The hot potato cold potato, the tempura shrimp vanilla bean stick skewer, liquid black truffle ravioli, etc. They offered not boring small dishes in between courses to make you marvel: how did they do it? such as the thin layer of shaved ice frozen on a cone like ceramic holder, all I could taste was refreshingly lemony flavors in the texture of snow! One of the desserts definitely made me fall in love faster than ever. There were so many tiny various sizes of cubes in different flavors, on the plate, there was some small swirl of sauces. Each of them were small, but each of them had an explosion of flavors!! I was almost moved to tears...:) The course-to-course pace was well managed. The servers were amiable, professional and knowledgeable. We also ordered wine paring, the wine concierge was great. The whole dining experience was like an amazing show, with seamless flow, excellent performance and wonderful surprises. We really felt like we looked at food differently after Alinea. The experience was memorable. Excellency doesn't come with a cheap price tag. :) The meal for two people including wine paring came down as close to one thousand dollars. It was the most expensive meal we've had so far, however, it's SO worth it, we wouldn't hesitate to spend it again or spend more in a heart beat."
102,"I spent more than an hour hitting redial on my telephone trying to make my reservation so needless to say I was very eager to finally be able to dine at Alinea although I was able to secure a 5:15 reservation--a bit early, but at least I finally got a reservation. When my sister and I arrived at 5:00 (didn't want to be late), we were escorted to the upstairs front room that was very nice--much better than the dark rooms I passed when I went to the restroom. The pace of service was too quick. Not just for my table, but for all of the tables in the room. We had our check paid within 2 1/2 hours--a bit too quick for what should have been a more leisurely meal. Definitely should have been a 3 hour meal. Also, after about the 5th course, I got tired/annoyed with the waiter telling me how to eat each course--""do this/don't do this"". Really annoying was the captain who instructed us not to place the used flatware on the napkin since the napkin would be used later in the dinner; surprise: the napkin was eventually removed and never seen again. There was a plating on wet seaweed that was simply unappealing to look at although the tastes of the shellfish were good once dug out of the slimey seaweed. Absolutely hated the tastes of ginger--I've never been a big ginger fan, but after this course that were mere tastes of different very pungently-flavored ginger, I now rank ginger among my least favorite flavors (almost as bad as olives). I did love the truffle raviolo. I did enjoy the smoking pear dessert. Didn't care for the famous shattered white chocolate since I've never found white chocolate to have much flavor. The tasting of lamb that came with about 60 drops of flavor should have had a ""cheat sheet"" since I wasted the small bites in some less than stellar tastings--definitely would have liked to have known what I was tasting. The Miro spoons were very good. The best thing about the dinner was the excellent bottle of Robert Weil Auslese that I had selected. I had such high expectations for my much anticipated dinner at Alinea, and maybe if I lived in Chicago, I'd go back to try it again. Since I live in NYC, and visit Chicago only on a very infrequent basis, I'll be trying other restaurants when I return."
103,"I absolutely love Alinea. Alot of people argue about it not being worth the price, but I definitely think it is. I have been here twice, and the 2nd time I was a bit nervous that it would not be as exciting, but my qualms were set aside on the first bite. It truly is like anything you have ever tasted... over, and over, and over again. I did find the wine flights to be a little overwhelming towards the end, so I suggest ordering a bottle of wine. The staff is attentive and friendly, and are clearly proud to be working here. It is a theme park experience of the mouth, an event like any other, and that's what you need to realize before you dive in. Its not just dinner, its an experience. My father (who has cooked for my family for over 3 decades) put it well when I asked him what he thought. ""Eating here is devastating, because I realize I'll never get to eat like this again unless I come back."" Truly remarkable and unforgetable. Worth the hype."
104,"Dear future patron of Alinea, Where do I even begin? Okay, so tickets were booked for Chicago and I called one month in advance to make reservations at Alinea. I got a busy signal for 2 hours straight, but I finally got through and reservations were made. Success! Okay, my party and I got here and nearly missed this place. The outside looked like some type of garage until we saw a small folding sign on the ground that says ""Alinea."" Bingo! We were taken to our seats. We were the first ones to arrive and it felt really awkward at first because there were so many servers around and they were looking at us. My party didn't really talk much because it would echo off the walls since it was that quiet. After 10-15 minutes more diners showed up...*phew the awkwardness was gone. So here is the dinner in a brief summary: -Very interesting, nothing I have experienced before -Assembling was needed in some dishes -Everything was delicious -Loved the concept -Nifty plating techniques -Delicious foam...yes foam with taste! -Took a shot of the ""aquarium"" and had a leaf stuck in my windpipe...haha that wasn't fun -The glasses were never half full -Explosion...wow that was something, wished there were more of those -The waitstaff warned us on some foods not to eat with mouth open or it would end up on ourselves or the person across from us (I wonder if anyone really got food on others) -We were also warned not to lick this ice cold lid-thing because apparently someone in the past done it and their tongue got stuck - at least his tongue was stuck to something yummy -The dessert was AMAZING, it was beautifully put together by Chef Grant Achatz himself So how was the experience? Definitely worth hopping on a plane for and planning everything around this 4.5 hour dinner for. Every dish was like Christmas because you don't know what is going to come out next. And as for me I was like a kid, who couldn't wait until Christmas to open my presents - that I broke the rules and opened lids and such when they told me not to. I still remember one of the waitstaff said to me, ""You just couldn't have waited 20 seconds huh?"" Haha. The whole experience was very interesting and fun. The servers were really friendly and funny, which I thought they would've been more uptight because of how fancy this place was. My party and I had a great time here! Yours truly, A gal with an appetite, who will travel for food P.S. - they are vegetarian friendly too P.P.S. - I've uploaded pictures without captions because I don't want to spoil any surprises P.P.P.S. - *Hut hut* If you hear something that sounds like a football game huddle in the kitchen, it's just Cheft Achatz (think of him as the quarterback) and his team making your dinner. P.P.P.P.S. - Now you're done reading this review, what are you waiting for? Make reservations already!"
105,"What's there to really say. Its rated the best restaurant in North America for a reason. Service was great and despite the strict dress code the atmosphere was a lot more laid back that I expected and about as unpretentious as a $500 dinner can be. It definitely had a playful aspect to it and the staff added just enough casual conservation and humor that kept everything very relaxed . I won't deconstruct my meal course by course and ruin the element of surprise as it was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the meal, but to put it simply it was like Disneyland for your mouth. There are very few dishes that can make you take a step back and just say wow, yet Grant Achatz manages to do several times through the experience. Don't read any more reviews, don't look at the menu, just trust the world class staff to take you on a culinary journey that is truly a lifetime experience."
106,"Comparing an Alinea experience to any other meal is dangerous. As such, I'm not going to call what I had at Alinea ""a meal."" Rather, what I had was a tour of culinary technique, paced over several hours, administered by unflappably polite and knowledgeable staff, in a refined and comfortable setting. This tour was one of the most memorable things I've ever done. The quality of what was served and how it was served left clearer imprints on my mind than any other food I've ever eaten. This was due to the fact that each of the eighteen courses was willfully prepared and stunningly arranged. The entirety of the staff endeavored towards a single end for every morsel of food prepared. And the result of that unified clarity of purpose resulted in clarity of flavor, clarity of texture, and clarity of presentation. Years from now, when I look back on this experience, the footprints left in my mind will be as deep and defined as they are now. Such is the result of the care and genius that the staff of Alinea demonstrates. I thank them a thousand times over for it, and strongly encourage all those who can to experience it themselves."
107,Perhaps the best dining experience of my life. I have been to 3 molecular gastronomy type restaurants in the past and travel extensively always looking for the best restaurant. This was one of the most enjoyable and fun meals of my entire life. Creative cuisine that was delicious and affects all the senses!
108,"It was disappointing. I mean, it was of course excellent, but it was not the best restaurant in the country. Not close, actually. There is no bar, just wine. They caution you not to drink too much because they feel it could interfere with the experience. It's very interactive, with lots of playful presentations and some do it yourself stuff. I have no problem with the obvious pretense of all of this, if you deliver the goods. But they didn't. When you have this much arrogance, if you pull it off, that's great. When you don't, it comes off as just arrogant. Some of the dishes were just awesome, but others fell flat, and some just didn't make sense. And there was not nearly as much of the molecular gastronomy-type presentations as I would've expected--the kind where you are surprised by the flavor or texture or both. Just not much of that. Much of the experience depends on the instructions from the wait staff. Since it is so interactive, you rely on the waiters to explain exactly how to assemble and eat your food. One dish in particular, involved short rib dished onto a piece of pasta, on which you then spoon about 10 different accompaniments. The waiter basically said, just put it together and eat it however you want. My wife stuffed it all in her mouth in one bite, which in retrospect wasn't the way to go. Even I, who ate it in three bites, thought the number of accompaniments was overkill and prohibited me from really appreciating what I was eating. And one of the dishes was borrowed from their Next menu, which annoyed me because it just seemed lazy to do that. My guess is that a lot of this was due to Achatz not being in the kitchen that night, which was a huge disappointment. Anyway, I can't say I would recommend it. I would like to try it again when Achatz is there, but that's rather impossible to predict, and I don't know when I'll be in Chicago again."
109,"I am a bit conflicted writing this review, because the food, wine pairings, service, and dining experience at Alinea were all top notch. I won't go into great detail about the dishes - I'm sure other reviewers have already done a great job of that - but my personal favorites were the scallop with foam, frozen chocolate mousse, and yuzu snow. So why only three stars? Dining at Alinea is a bit like a trip to Vegas. Yes, I had a blast, but since leaving the restaurant I have felt a pervasive sense of guilt from dropping a small fortune on dinner for two. Yes, we were celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary, and you only live once (a life motto that usually guides my principles), but fair warning: eating here will (or at least should) mess with your conscience."
110,"Amazingly delicious food with creative presentation; friendly, professional yet un-stuffy service, generous wine pairing poured by a knowledgeable staff. I recommend getting an early reservation so you eat comfortably for 4+ hours. Menu changes 4 times a year. Really memorable dishes: Beef short rib served with 10 different garnishes and you manually wrap it all in a tomato based pasta sheet. Delicious ""walk in the woods"" dish that's of various mushroom served with a pine cream. The centerpiece that predictably turns out to be your salad later on. Of course, the ""splat, splat, crack"" dessert that you've read all about everywhere else. Minor things: Restaurant was very quiet so you can't speak too loudly before 6pm. Almost wish they had some background music. There were two chefs serving our dessert. One of them broke our frozen chocolate mousse prematurely before putting it on our table and didn't serve us the broken pieces. $210 for the gazillion course dinner, $160 for basic wine pairing, $225 (?) for the reserved wine pairing, Wine by the glass averages $15 - $30 (very reasonable). Didn't read the half bottle or bottle pages. I love how all dishes were served on these functional yet creative dinnerware. These are no ordinary plates. You'll have to see it for yourself."
111,"So here's the deal. The food is great-- no surprise here. It's Willy Wonka fabulous, and you'll probably eat stuff (and combinations of stuff) that you've never had before and will never eat again. The food is art, the art is food (you'll understand after you eat your centerpiece), and the exquisite attention to detail is...well...exquisite. The service was fine-- I didn't find it to be over the top stuffy, but it wasn't overly friendly either. The waitstaff was pretty smirky with each other, and I could actually overhear them gossiping and making fun of some of the other patrons in the restaurant (we were seated close to the service station in the middle of each room). The wine...made me mad. That's right. It was offensive. I expected our food to be expensive, and I was ready for that. What I wasn't ready for was a $500 wine bill. We decided to do the ""reserve pairing,"" and in all fairness, we were warned it was going to be a little more expensive. The wine was good, but it certainly wasn't great-- and our 4 glasses a piece (be prepared for a splash of wine every other course), just shouldn't have been that expensive. You're getting a few mouthfuls of wine that retails for $80/bottle. So go for the food-- but save your money when it comes to beverages. Drink a glass (or bottle) of something really nice before you go, and save your money for something like...the cost of a month's rent."
112,"WOW WOW WOW!!! is my palate in love, I flew out from SF on a whim when my girlfriends cousin was able to get reservations for this place. Thanks Miranda. I mean just spectacular and creative. I mean i sat down for 4 hours, and dish after dish was amazing, not a lot of food, just small and good. Not only was the food good but the way they presented it and the ideas behind it extravagant. Note to diners: is the wine pairing worth it? only if you want to spend 200 smackeroo's to make your mouth have more of an orgasm then it's already having. No thanks i'll just choose the 300 bottle of wine instead. All in all this is one of the best dining experiences i have EVER had, other was in Bordeaux, which is a bit different. So this is a must do for foodies, I have yet to try other top restaurants in the nation, will make my way to Per Se, and French Laundry sooner rather than later."
113,"Was this place worth traveling to Chicago for? Yes. Was the experience memorable and the food amazing? ABSO-FREAKIN-LUTELY! Oh Black Truffle Explosion... I hope we meet again... The food was not only spectacular, but also fun to eat. The place is classy but not stuffy, and the servers were great. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ This is the menu from that day, but you should just let yourself be surprised... The only thing I knew I would be eating was foam..."
114,"Best. Meal. Ever. We ate for over 4 hours and were happily stuffed by the the time the last dessert dish finished. The excellent pacing of the dishes really made the difference. If I could re-do the meal, I would skip the wine pairing and instead ask the sommelier to suggest a glass or two [unless you use $100 bills as toilet paper, in which case, knock yourself out and enjoy the wines]. Spoiler alert: I think it's really fun to come here with no idea of what the dishes are, but if you're one of those people who don't like surprises, full meal report with photos over at https://www.facebook.com."
115,"It's all about the experience. Pretentious? OMG Yes. But also delightfully fun, creative, delicious, interesting, experimental, and unexpected. Alinea was an amazing dining experience. Everything about it from walking into an unmarked door to the service to the food was all impeccable. This is a food experience unlike anything I have ever tried. Most of the dishes were wonderful and complex. Not everything worked and tasted great. But you sort of understand what they were trying to accomplish even if the result wasn't perfected. Each dish was served on some gadget out of Alton Brown's kitchen. They had pins, knifes, wires, pillows, and all types of strange contraptions. One memorable dish was the ""Hot Potato"", cold potato soup, black truffle, butter. The almost overpowering truffle in this cold soup really blended so well with the potato. It brought the main ingredients to the forefront and I had wished more of the touring menu was like this. The Rhubarb; ginger, basil course was really unexpected. It was a candy ball containing sweet and refreshing rhubarb and basil juice. The ball created an intense flavor explosion in your mouth. Some dishes that I didn't think work as well was the Wagyu Beef. This was brought out frozen and pinned to a stand to let defrost over several courses. The Wagyu was sliced so thinly for it to defrost properly; it was difficult to taste the wonderful fatty meat. The Dry shot, pineapple, rum, cilantro was served in powdered form in a paper envelope and you're supposed to empty the packet in your mouth. It created a pina colada shot but the powders didn't mix well so you are left with a dry clump. It was definitely creative but not so tasty. Maybe it was because we did the five hour 25 course touring menu and it was around 1 o'clock in the morning at that point. But when we got to the desserts they did not live up to the other courses. This was really a once in a lifetime experience for me. I don't think I would do the 25 course menu again but absolutely the smaller tasting menu."
116,"Who would have guessed that a meal at a fancy restaurant could be so much FUN? First of all, the menu at Alinea is a secret - you don't get to see it beforehand. This means that each course is a big adventure (although they do ask you beforehand if there's anything you're allergic to, so they don't inadvertently kill you). Next, each course is interactive. Instead of just passively sitting there while each dish is placed before you and then using the usual boring knife and fork, you actually have to DO different things to enjoy each course. There are courses that you eat with your fingers; tidbits of food on a skewer where you have to lean forward and bite it off; fresh greens growing in a centerpiece of real soil which you harvest for your salad yourself by snipping them off with manicure scissors; liquid courses that you suck out of a tube; dishes that come apart and have to be assembled a certain way before you can combine the different ingredients to complete the entre. Then there are all the surprising blends of different flavors: salty steelhead roe eggs with sweet watermelon mousse; hamachi deep-fried with banana and ginger; a cheese-flavored ravioli with a liquid center of black truffle; chocolate with red pepper sauce. The creativity, attention to detail, and formal presentation devoted to each dish is incredible. Our dessert was literally a work of art which was created right in front of us -- by head chef Grant Achatz himself, we later found out -- before we were allowed to eat it by scraping it off the surface of the table (which had been covered with a practical rubber tablecloth beforehand). I've never been so tempted to take a picture of my food, which I thought was something only tourists do, but I was too eager to dive in and start eating. In most high-end restaurants, you feel as if you have to mind your table manners. Here, it's perfectly acceptable to lick your fingers (although they do provide hot towels for the especially messy finger foods) and otherwise enjoy yourself. If you like wine, Alinea prides itself on its wine list, but better to go with the optional wine pairing where each course is perfectly complimented by a specially selected wine. Arrive hungry - the portions are tiny, but after a total of 16 or so courses (we lost count), you'll be more than satisfied. Also, save a visit here for special occasions because it's definitely pricey - but do go at least once. It's definitely worth the three-star Michelin rating. Have fun!"
117,"It's going to be long. Must be brief to fit the experience in 5001 characters. Alinea is a special occasion kinda place. Before you can dine here you must get a reservation here. The trick is they open up reservations two months in advance so if you want to eat in March you better call Jan 1 to snag that spot up (especially if it's a weekend). You've got your reservations? Great! It's located in a building that's pretty nondescript. During the day my friend described it as...""shady looking."" In the evening there will be a tiny sign for Valet Service ($11). Unless you're lucky and there's a spot open, why not just Valet (You're already splurging on this epic meal.) Oh yea...formal jackets required...don't be a bum! The interior looks like an upscale office. Tell them your name and reservation time and off you go to your seats! They'll take your valet card so they can prep your car when your meal is ending or call you a cab if that's the route you went. Service! They only do wines so don't expect cocktails. Wine pairings ranged from 160 to 250. Ok Food! Warning that there will be some spoilers! Steelhead Roe sitting on a bed of watermelon mousse, wrapped in watermelon flesh and finished off with watermelon consume poured in with an edible flower. Wonderful starter that was mostly sweet, but light elements of savory. Hamachi bite that had pineapple salt, ginger, west indie spices, and kaffir lime with Vanilla Bean Stick for holder. Complex flavors here. It was sweet, but also sour from the kaffir, then salty and rich from the hamachi. Another good opening to get your tastebuds going. At this point they brought out what looked like fruit rollups and set them down and told us we'd deal with them later...intrigue! The next dish was a quad that we were supposed to eat in a specific order. The presentation was these 4 shellfish sitting on kelp sitting on this driftwood. Oyster Leaf topped with a mignonette. Leaves that taste like oysters! Taylor Bay Scallop with old bay oil and a white ale foam. One of the highlight bites of the night. The scallop was juicy and firm and had an overall richness of flavor. Top Neck Clam with an xo sauce and carrot and ginger tapiocas. This reminded me of Asian cuisine with the xo sauce and the salty flavors. Mussel with saffron, chorizo, and orange. The mussel was sitting in the shell and the other flavors were these cubes that sat on top of it so as you chewed the flavors got intense based on which cube you were hitting. Yuba (tofu skin) with shrimp and a miso mayo dip. They dried it, rolled it up, and deep fried it to create a stick then wrapped a shrimp around it and placed it in a holder that had a well of miso mayo dipping sauce. Chip and dip! Mackerel bite with juniper, radish flower, and mango. We were just to chomp down and slide the bite off the wire. Great layers to the flavors. Salty richness from the mackeral moving down to the sweet mango. Wild Mushrooms dish. A mixture of wild mushrooms with sumac, pine, and ramps. The mushrooms individually had great earthy flavors, but it didn't come together as a whole for me. Hot Potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter...one of the winners of the night. Small wax bowl with a wire in it that has a potato sphere with a black truffle cap, a cube of butter, and a cube of something else. You pull the wire out so everything falls in and then take the whole bite. Wow, great bite. Lamb Loin with lamb jous reduction and barnaise along with mini potato spheres. There were 2 small lamb loin medallions topped with a slice of artichoke heart and 2 small asparagus tips. This sat on a crunchy, flaky disc. On the center and sides were the jous and sauce to dip in. Short Rib, olive, fermented garlic, fresh blackberry, smoked salt, white wine radish, tobacco agar...this is where those flags come in play. Make your own wrap with all this stuff. Also you get to make the holder for the tomato pasta and the engineer in me got happy. Black Truffle explosion. Winner! Single bit of ravioli with liquid truffle inside...that is all Octopus with eggplant mousse and soup. Also great, the mousse was awesome. Yuzu Snow. Palette cleanser. Sprayed yuzu mist over a super cold dish to create snow. You scrape to create a granita. Refreshing. Peach, jasmine, basil, balsamic, mozzarella cubes. Think caprese salad. Basil cubes and mozzarella ice cream were win. Lemongrass juice, dragonfruit, and herbs. A tube where you sucked down this refreshing liquid. Chocolate mousse, red pepper, bitter orange, banana rum brulee, and rum cake. The chefs came out to create this art on the table for us. The mousse was frozen in liquid nitro. Lots of fun to watch and eat! Servers were warm, funny, joked with us. It was awesome. They told us we were sitting at Zac Efron's table but were more fun. Our sommelier was passionate, knowledgeable, and talked like a motorboat. Running out of chars. So TRY IT!"
118,"Let me tell you about a small, unassuming building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, IL. An incognito dark grey facade that casually juts out a few feet further than it's neighboring buildings is all that this building offers. There is no signage, no lights, and no indicator about the activities carried on within. Nothing to suggest to you that you are at the site of the number one restaurant in North America. Once you pull open the plain doors of 1723 N. Halsted, you walk into a dark hallway with cascading walls and soothing red light. The hallway abruptly halts to a dead end and right before your mind tells you that you did something wrong, an automatic sliding, stainless-steel door (I swear they imported it from the Starship Enterprise) opens to your left and you are immediately greeted by a staff member who soothingly coos, ""Welcome to Alinea."" My excitement for this restaurant runs deep. I have had the cookbook for ages and I constantly admire it for the expert photography and the insightful details that Grant Achatz shares about the establishment and his thought process behind the food. I have read many reviews and articles published about Achatz and Alinea too. My level of expectation when I finally got to sit down in the restaurant was brutally high. I kept thinking to myself, ""It's okay if it disappoints a little, my expectations are just too lofty."" I'll spare you the details of the dishes. We had 18 courses with wine pairings so it'd take way too many words. The menu changes regularly too so my banter about it would just be outdated within a few months. But I'll assure you this: the dishes are as gorgeous to look at as they are delicious. Chef Achatz' command of flavor, texture, sight, and surprise is unsurpassed and the many articles I've read comparing a dinner at Alinea to a performance at the theater are not exaggerated. The final dessert course is something a lot of people often write about. We had the privilege of having Chef Achatz do the plating himself and that topped off a night that many of us would probably never forget. The experience at Alinea is almost just as important as the food that goes along with it. My advice is to leave your fears about the bill outside of the plain grey facade of the restaurant and enjoy yourself without hindrance. Because after you step through that sliding stainless-steel door, that will be the last plain thing you experience for the rest of the night."
119,"Since my attempt to dine here when I was in Chicago 2 years ago was thwarted, I was more than determined to visit Alinea during my recent trip back to my hometown 2 weeks ago. I refused to book my plane tickets for my high school friend's wedding before I got a reservation. And I apologize for my co-workers who had to listen to me for 4 hours of repeated calling, groaning at the busy signal, and repeating that over and over again until I finally got through (clearly I will not be winning any employee of the year awards). I loved almost everything except for a course that featured English peas. Can't quite put my finger on what it was that I didn't like about it, because I do enjoy peas, but in comparison to the other stellar bites of food I had, this one just didn't do it for me. Service was spectacular - I love how unobtrusive the servers are. They seemed to anticipate when I would need them without making me feel like they were peering over my shoulder during the 4-ish hours we dined there. We got the wine pairings, which were the equivalent of about 4-5 glasses of wine. I must be a lightweight because I was having quite a time staying upright on the red line back to my hotel. Whoops. Oh, and definitely do not lick the Yuzu Snow. My husband and I were warned to not do so because it is really super cold, and there's a chance of getting your tongue stuck. GUESS WHO GOT HIS TONGUE STUCK. Ahem. I'm definitely not naming names, but I'm glad he was able to get his tongue unstuck before we had to call for help."
120,"This was a while back, but decided to write a review anyway. It felt like i was entering a space ship, but once i got inside the place, I was amazed by the decor. It was simple and elegant. The center piece on our table was very unique, it was actually part of our meal. We had the tasting menu, each item was amazing. It's true that the flavors burst in your mouth, each item was uniquely prepared. The service was top notch!! Although it was the most expensive dinner I've ever had, the experience was truely amazing. Expect to spend $500+ for two people and 4-5 hours"
121,"Did you really just give the ""best restaurant in America"" less than 5 stars on yelp??? Nahhh.. But really, it's hard to write a review on such an intimidating restaurant but actually it's not at all. Intimidating that is. I didn't know what the expect and was afraid to walk in and have everyone staring at me like I had a big ""noob"" sign on my face. But the service was awesome and the atmosphere was not pretentious at all even though neither of us (2) ordered the wine pairing. The food is also obviously amazing. Way beyond anything I've ever eaten and probably beyond my comprehension of how complex the food is. There are many many many reviews about the food and pictures and books even so I'll just impart a few nuggets of knowledge. - We didn't read too much about each individual dish which was nice because we like to be surprised. Especially the dessert at the end.. I won't ruin it. - Being the good foodies we were, we were taking a few notes and pictures along the way. Turns out they give you this awesome menu at the end which has names and a little chart of flavors. - Took us 3-4 weeks out to make reservations and we called a few times to get a better time. They have a wait list but it's just day of. - Plan on being there for at least 3.5 hours. We got there 6pm and left at 10pm and only had a table of 2."
122,"On January 20, 2012, I dined at Alinea. It was one of the best meals I will ever live to enjoy, and I'm okay with that. For the first time, I find it impossible to fit both a thoughtful review and a complete log of my meal into 5000 characters. I don't expect anyone to read all of this, but if you're interested, the full tour will be written below, with the remainder to follow. Michael K. snagged us a table for 9:15, weeks before we booked our flights for the bone chill of January in Chicago. My flight cost $220. My meal at Alinea $335. I'll tell you which one I liked more in a second. With Janice K. and her sister Frances, we made a party of four. We arrived a few minutes early and took advantage of the kitchen view while we waited. Grant Achatz kept himself busy in the most spotless, populated kitchen I've ever seen. When the time came, we were led to the downstairs dining room. The atmosphere was cool and calm, and the space was modern and sparsely decorated, interesting but not distracting. Our table got some flair from a captivating block of clear ice with magenta vial-shaped pockets. We were told this was not edible. Service was worthy of all 3 Michelin stars. Our head waiter Alex took care of us beautifully, with help from sommelier Ben, and waiters Johnny and Jeremiah. They were personable, even jokey, while never straying from perfect competence and professionalism. They presented every course in detail, and swept the table for crumbs after each dish was cleared. We kept Alex and Ben up until almost 2AM, and they made us feel welcome, even liked, while they waited on us hand, foot, finger, toe. We ordered two of the cheaper bottles of wine on the menu (a $55 Riesling and a $65 Rioja) instead of springing for the pairing, and we had no regrets. Otherwise, we were offered no choices, once we confirmed that we suffered neither aversions nor allergies. The feast just poured in, blowing our minds one bite at a time. The first part of our meal was a poem in sea ink, opening with charred cured roe with coconut, carrot, and a curry yuzu reduction. Other than the roe, nothing came in its original form, instead bringing soft textures that let the burst of roe take the tactile spotlight. The light, sweet, salty, curry-tinged dish set the bar high. Then came a presentation of shellfish on Malaysian driftwood draped with seaweed that told us the bar was there to stay. An oyster leaf confused and delighted, topped with a shallot mignonette. I hardly knew oyster could taste so much like oyster, never mind a single green leaf. King crab with passionfruit, pineapple, hearts of palm, avocado, rum, allspice, and vanilla provided a playful run of sweet and tropical flavors, with a juicy chunk of crab at its center. A long shell of razor clams marinated in XO sauce brought hearty Asian flavors with soy, shiso, and daikon. I loved the way the firm chew of the clams was accented by an accompaniment of carrot and ginger tapioca. The last shell on the driftwood held one of my favorite bites of the night - sea urchin with banana sabayon, black truffle, and coarse salt. Sweet, silky, earth-and-sea-scented perfection. Seafood played a supporting role in the next course, which featured yuba, dehydrated and fried, wrapped around jumbo shrimp with chive, orange taffy, sesame seeds, and togarashi, dipped into a sweet miso emulsion. There was crunch, there was snap; sesame seeds stuck to lips and tablecloth. While we enjoyed the yuba, we watched dashi brew in a siphon. The clear pot held seaweed, konbu, bonito, scallion, ginger, yuzu, and mirin, and when the broth was done, it was served with a delicate cube of scallop mousseline, fried to imitate agedashi tofu, garnished with cucumber, nasturtium, wasabi, carrot, chive, celery, and yuzu rind. The scallop was utterly delicious, with a slight crust and creamy insides. The broth and aromatics were irresistible, and I was glad when we got a cup of dashi to sip on. A long metal antenna impaled our next course, a bite of Hungarian wooly ham and hibachi-grilled squid, with sherry, orange, and fennel, which we plucked with our teeth. The tender squid fell just short of overpowering the ham, but they played together nicely. Then we drank our centerpiece. It was filled with a sweet floral juice of beet, hibiscus, and Italian licorice, which we had standing with glass straws. After that came an interlude of Sicilian family style dining, a way for Achatz to show that anything you can do, he can do better. Moist, flaky, herb roasted Atlantic scup came filleted over garlic basil mint puree, with sides of panella chickpea crackers and caponata, and a ramekin of Sicilian sea salt. The fish was perfectly cooked, and fritters were fun and crunchy. The caponata was the ultimate rustic side, with firm eggplant and raisins, capers, olives, pine nuts, and celery. The scup also came with wine - a pouring of French chardonnay, in ornate glasses. ***"
123,"If you told me a few years ago that I'd be dropping $850 for a meal (btwn 3 ppl) sans wine pairings and would be redialing 250 times for a rez for said meal...I'd think that you were insane. Because really, what meal is worth that cost and effort? My friends and colleagues probably still think I'm insane! But you know what? It was one of the best experiences of my life. If you have the time and resources I highly recommend a trip to Alinea. Just some personal notes before you do so. I won't really go into the food because I think plenty has been said about how amazing and creative it all is. Also, there's not much else to say about the service except that it was impeccable and not stuffy or pretentious at all. It truly was as good as it gets. 250 redials sound ridiculous, but that was because we had a short window in which we were in Chicago (namely two nights)...and it was summer time. If you wanted to dine on a Wednesday during a bad weather month...probably won't be as much effort. I agree with Valerie H.- dining at Senior Citizen time is actually a good thing because you get to see your dishes come out first as there is only one menu. However...it's not a big deal to just revert your eyes if you dine later. We actually had a 5:45 rez and some folks were there before us so we just made an effort to not look over at their table. I highly recommend reading Chef Achatz's book Life, on the Line: A Chef's Story of Chasing Greatness, Facing Death, and Redefining the Way We Eat before you dine at Alinea. SImply one of the best non-fiction pieces I've ever read. I made my husband and our 3rd dining companion (a high school buddy of mine) read this before our meal and they agreed with me that the book enhanced the experience even more. Wear something dressy, but also comfortable. We were there for nearly 4 hours I think. The thing I appreciated about Alinea was the pacing and amount of food. We weren't so stuffed by the end that we couldn't enjoy our dessert. The portions were just right throughout the meal and when we left we felt satisfied, but not so full that it hurt to walk. What was my favorite course? Everyone has their personal faves but I particularly loved the fried hamachi course. Pairing it with a whole vanilla bean as a ""utensil"" was a great experience for the senses."
124,"Completely incredible experience. 27 individual, tiny ""bomb-like"" experiences in a row. Little ""micro courses"" of flavor, texture, temperature, and smell. I read Peter Segal's book, Vice, on the flight to Chicago and booked dinner from the plane. My buddy and I had 4 hours of never-before and never-again food science creations from this amazing sensory experience. These course come out at intervals, there's plenty of time to savor and then reflect on what you've just had, and the staff does a great job of explaining and couching the food. Get the wine pairings so you have the ultimate experience. Be prepared for a lengthy stay, though. Be ready for conversation as we don't typically have 4 hour, dozen-course meal here in the States. Even foodies may reach the ""oh my god, we have YET MORE courses to go"" stage, but stick it out! You'll likely never experience such a series of elaborately-prepared and intricately-delivered foods again."
125,"Oh Alinea, how I wanted to love you. We waited months to visit, stressed about getting our reservation, and anticipated the dinner probably far more than we should have. Maybe if I hadn't done my homework prior to coming here, I wouldn't have such high expectations. The presentation is amazing. The creativity put behind the dishes is what sells this place. I just wish that the rest of the experience supported that. The wait staff was hit or miss. There were a few gentlemen who were fantastic at their job. I don't care whether you are working at Alinea or Dennys...your job is the same. A server should be able to adapt to their patrons regardless of personality. We had a few who could drop off a dish and flutter away without even being noticed and then come back again when we were feeling chatty and keep up with our slightly wine-induced humor. Then there were some that were just so rigid in their disposition that I felt uncomfortable. One in particular came off as incredibly pretentious. Hearing his affected accent when describing wines and food made me cringe, and this culminated in his describing a Hungarian wine to a table adjacent to ours and sneaking out ""Budapest"" in the most horrific accent I have ever heard. I am Hungarian. No...just...no. Chef Achatz came out for the dessert and I didn't even realize it was him until hours later at home when my boyfriend pointed it out. I wasn't expecting a huge show, but a modest introduction from him would have been kind. He simply walked over and began tossing things on the table with brief explanations under mumbled breath. I will not go on and on about the details of the dinner as many people have before. If you can look past the service, the food is enjoyable. Is it the best meal I have ever experienced? No. Is is the most creative? Could be, but molecular gastronomy is all fairly creative. I most likely will not go back as there are so many other options to try in the same price point, but it was a good experience nonetheless."
126,"It's delicious and incredible. I never want to go again. The food was good and the wine pairings were wonderful. The service was so attentive it was almost over the top. If you are in dire need of an ego boost, you'll leave feeling like the world revolves around you. The thing is, I really don't want to spend 4 hours eating a meal. I felt like Gretel being plumped up. At the end of the night it was just so much food and the dessert really pushed me over that unhappily full edge. I wanted someone to stick me in a wheel barrow and roll me out. It's definitely worth going to and is certainly an experience. I'm happy I got to try it but this is on my once a decade list."
127,"This is my first review and I'm glad that it's for Alinea! I initially called over 20 times to book a dinner reservation for my girlfriend's birthday, which was two months away. So yes, it is very difficult to get reservations here, especially at a reasonable dinner time. But it was SOOOO worth it! My girlfriend and I agree, it was the most EPIC meal of our lives. The service, presentation of the dishes, flavor combinations, everything was just spectacular. It's an experience like none other. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert. The chef comes out and makes it for you right on your table! I wish I could come back here for dinner every month, if only it wasn't incredibly expensive. All in all, chef Grant Achatz does an amazing job. I would definitely recommend all my friends to atleast dine at his restaurant once!"
128,"In a nutshell: Food: 5 stars (period.) P/C: 4.5 stars Service 4.5 stars Alinea really brought me out of my culinary, gastronomical box, helped me come to a realization that this is truly one of a kind, and provided an example how such a perfect combination of a form of art and a form of science can create wonders, i mean wonders. I have to admit, I was a bit nervous before I went in here. I have this jinx about restaurants - if i have a wonderful experience in one restaurant, the next restaurant i visit just turns out to be a mediocre experience (and i feared more after such a wonderous experience i had at L2O the night before). and throughout the night, everything that i ate, felt, smelled, and saw at this restaurant proved me wrong. I am going to omit what I had - because it'd just be too difficult to list them and depict them there. if you're ever going here - just let them know of your dietary restrictions, and let them take care of you and take you through the journey of your life. you're in good hands. the goods: 1. i LOVED the thrill of not knowing exactly what i was going to have next. every dish after another was something to be awed about and to be remembered for a long time. they used lots of apparatus, gadgets and other whimsically brilliant ways to absorb the experience. 2. i LOVED even more how they really paid particular attention to my sense of smell - in 4~5 dishes, they really brought out something that not only made my sense of taste happy but also my sense of smell - amazingly done. 3. when i close my eyes, walk through the journey and pick one dish that moved me the most - it was the loup de mer dish - wonderfully sumptuous whole fish simply grilled with lemon and mint, complemented by sea salt, mint pesto (?), caponata (amazing...), and chick pea chips. the was nothing molecular or scientific about this dish, but they stuck to the fundamentals (good ingreidnets, good execution skills and the marriage of the ingredients). i will never forget this dish. 4. the wine program was pretty dynamic - pretty much stuck around in the old world. the chassagne-montrachet was my favorite pairing with the loup de mer. the echezeaux was a bit too tight for me, and the wild mushroom dish didn't fully open up all the good stuff that wine probably had. 5. service - spot-on. the interval between dishes was absolutely perfect. the servers were interactive and friendly but not too chatty (golden..) 6. the presentation obviously was creative and out of this world. i got a little tensed up on parts where i had to participate, but oh my am i going to remember them. 7. they completely listened and took care of my hatred toward game meats. i didn't see them anywhere near me during dinner. 8. the staff anticipate what you're going to do and take care of you - i managed a major coffee stain on my beige jacket, they must have sensed some distraught-ness in my face, brought a thing of shout-wipes so i can undo the stain. 9. A real time perfomance by Chef Achatz with the last dessert - nicely done. the not-so-goods: 1. this is really my own fault, but the loup de mer portion was too big, i ended up eating almost the whole fish, which was a stupid move. gah. 2. not a sweet/dessert wine fan and after 3 consecutive sweet wines, i was getting dizzy. i personally would've preferred something a bit fruit-forward but not as sweet...the whole time i was having the last messy dessert - i was thinking gigondas. Alinea in a league of its own, it's simply not comparable to some of the other restaurants I've been - it was impressive on all fronts, i mean all fronts. it was 4 hours well spent and i will remember this experience for a long time. As of Alinea, i think I am at crossroads where I can definitively list out the things that I enjoy/look for in fine-dining experiences. I think I prefer traditional to eccentric and bread service to audience participation to assemble dishes. I have 110% for Alinea and everybody that makes the restaurant as successful as it is now and I am going to have to thank them for really opening a next chapter of my culinary journey. Thank you Alinea."
129,"Even with all the hype, it's awesome. I now know what dining experience I've missed. When we got out of the taxi, we weren't sure where Alinea was, exactly. By chance, someone asked us if we were looking for Alinea... ""oh, yes"" (must have been our attire or she just stands there and directs people idk). After finding the unmarked door, everything changes. Gosh, the waiters there are darn good waiters. They know so much about every course (and we had 20+ of them). The courses are beautiful; it felt like being an Iron Chef judge. The entire staff is ready to serve you. At one point, I asked where the restroom was and one of the waiter walked me there. When I went in, I was surprised that the toilet paper-end was folded in a triangle. Is this done after each person's visit to the restroom? When each course came out, I felt a little rude taking photos of EVERYTHING but I didn't want to miss anything. Make sure you make your reservations on the first when the books open for the month, 2 months prior (I'd double check)."
130,"Alinea may as well be called ""Alien-a"" because it's simply an OUT OF THIS WORLD culinary experience!!! Haha that was cheesy. Onward... Not too long ago I watched the Andrew Zimmern Bizarre Foods episode where he dined at Alinea. I was fascinated by the crazy contraptions used to create their culinary creations and immediately put this restaurant on my ""must try sometime in my life"" list. Then I realized it was also a 3-starred Michelin Restaurant. THEN I was sent to a work trip out to Chicago. AND my boyfriend just happened to have a work trip that brought him out to Chicago the same week. Needless to say it was meant to be for us two foodies to pay this place a visit. ""Subtle"" would be the word I have for this location, but I'm too excited about the food so I'm diving right in (there ARE 22 dishes, after all). The first course composed of 3 mini-servings of ""frozen drinks"", all meant to be consumed in a single bite. 1) Lemon - luxardo bitter, luxardo amaro, grapefruit: a frozen bite of liquor lifted with a delicate pin - a bit bitter for me but a good refreshing start to the meal. 2) Apple - laird's apple brandy, grenadine, thyme: a piece of crunchy apple encapsulated in a jelly liquor served on a circular spoon - once again a foreign and enlightening experience for the taste buds 3) Squash - cynar, carpano antica, flor de cana 7 year: served on a mini tower, a flan-like substance with a tasty foam. This was my favorite of the three, likely because it was the sweetest. 4) Steelhead Roe - dijon, retabaga, grapefruit: creamy, full of ""umami"", zero hint of fishiness paired with the essence of grapefruit.. simply delicious. 5) Yuba - Shrimp, miso, togarashi: a crunchy twist of fried tofu skin, wrapped with tender shrimp and dipped in a perfectly seasoned miso sauce. The asian side of me is comforted by this little ""snack"". 6) Urchin - watercress, vanilla, mint: A vanilla ""jello"" of sorts encapsulating a small piece of sea urchin. A small bite exploding in different flavors... I can't even describe this one because it was a medley of the strangest flavors popping in and out of my mouth. This dish ends with a sip of watercress soup served beneath the jello. 7) Halibut - black pepper, coffee, lemon: One of my favorite dishes of the night and presented in a snowy-white art form. The fish was perfectly cooked, the hint of coffee flavor permeated occasionally, the crunchy ""shrimp chips"" and the flawless cream sauce played together in a strange, but perfect harmony. YUM. 8) Rabbit - Parfait, rillett, consomm: A three-tiered dish (literally, served in a 3 tiered cylindrical bowl) beginning with a cool rabbit parfait on the top layer that was creamy yet refreshing, culminated to a rabbit meat medley (a cube of shredded meat alongside a fried ball of meat) covered in king trumpet mushroom and surrounded by butternut sauce, and finally ending with a clear rabbit broth kept warm by a hot stone and flavored with a stick of cinnamon. 9) Wlid mushrooms - pine, sumac, ramp: Loving this mushroom medley of wild mushrooms from the Fresno foothills in CA (what what)... weirdly spongy but super flavorful... another favorite. 10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter: Another creative sip of soup served on a mini wax bowl with a pin poking through, spearing a bite of potato, black truffle, and frozen butter. Pulling the pin releases these items into a cold potato broth... this dish was particularly different. 11) Short Rib - olive, red wine, blackberry: Yet another favorite dish. Earlier during dinner we were presented with 2 red ""flags"" in criss cross formation, which seemed a strange table decor. At this point we realized that this ""flag"" was an edible homemade tomato pasta. This pasta was then draped over a metal, cradlelike contraption that made space for the most tender and tasty short rib I've ever eaten. A plate of sides and sauces containing sea salt, olives, blackberry, sour cherry were all fair game to garnish this ""pasta short rib wrap"". Likely the most luxurious ""wrap"" I will ever eat; I was blown away. 12) Hamachi - West Indies spices, banana, ginger: served on a smoldering piece of cinnamon, this fried dish had a very ""Indian"" vibe to it although the banana felt like the centerpiece. 13) Canard - a la Cussy: Lots of ""best of""s during this meal, but this was the BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD. A puff pastry stuffed with duck innards, foie gras, cock's crest (first time trying... it was good), and topped with the 3 most tender slices of duck I've ever had along with a tiny piece of fried duck skin. I was getting really full at this point but I had to push through... 14) Venison - cherry, cocoa nib, eucalyptus: Once again, most tender piece of venison I've ever had. Not gamey, served on a ""lily pad"" like presentation that covered the bite of deer heaven. To be continued... yelp's 5000 word limit can't stop me..."
131,"It would have to take Alinea to get me out of my 2 years of not writing reviews slump. Holy crap, this place is the shit. Seriously. Save your money and go here before you die. I've never experienced anything like it. Each course could be put on display at the MCA and each course (with the exception of 2) was delicious. And Grant coming out for our last course to decorate our table with delicious chocolates, fruits, syrups, and nuggets?? F-ing surreal. It was surprising that such a highly regarded chef would come out and perform (yes, it was a performance) to an audience of two common folk. Believe the hype, this place is legit. I am already saving my money for another visit in the fall .."
132,"This was literally the best meal of my life (surpassing my previous best at Daniel in NYC). And yes, I literally flew to Chicago to eat here on the recommendation from my parents. I think the highlight for me was how interesting the food was. I was very anxious for each course to continue to come out so I could see what it would be. I was also a huge fan of the bite-sized nature of many of the courses- most degustations leave me feeling completely stuffed and struggling to try things. Alinea left me feeling pleasantly full, even though I got to try everything. As far as specific dishes go- I loved the black truffle explosion. I also thought the course with several different types of seafood on drift wood was well done, and I definitely couldn't get over harvesting my own table centerpiece garden during dinner. I'll leave it at that. I suppose the lowest point for me was one of the traditional lamb dishes- I just wasn't in love with it. It wasn't bad, I'm just not a huge lamb person. Seriously, if you're in Chicago, go here. If you aren't in Chicago, consider going to go Chicago so you can go here. And yes, it's expensive. But you knew that already."
133,"Best place to experience a classic faint! Decor - Awesome Price - Ouch Staff - Friendly My Must Try's Everything on the menu of course My Do Not Try's Even though it is hard to resist licking your plate, do not even attempt to lick The Yuzu Snow palate cleanser. Otherwise, you might end up having a 'Christmas Story' style tongue stuck to a pole experience. (We were specifically told not to lick the metal as they had used liquid nitrogen to freeze the juice.) Enjoy the experience!"
134,"There is no way, NO WAY, this place can get anything under a 5 star. My husband and I dined here last night and this morning we woke up and said to ourselves, ""did last night really happen""? It was surreal. The food was incredible, but that you expect. However, nothing beats the experience and service you will find at Alinea. Come in with an open mind and leave feeling incredible. Many ask if it's worth the $. My answer is, you're not paying for just the food, you're paying for an experience, and YES for that, it's worth it. An experience that you'll remember for the rest of your life. From the moment you walk in, you're transformed into another universe and look forward to what's to come like a kid waiting to unwrap each and every birthday gift. Each dish that comes out, is a surprise and a new experience. Overall, this place is a must if you can justify the cost (eg. promotion, big birthday, giving birth, etc.). Without alcohol, expect to pay about $500 with tax and tip. Until we meet again Alinea, you will be in my thoughts..."
135,"For my 1400th review, I decided to write it on a special place but it was unfortunately not so special for me. I heard recently it was rated 3 Michelin Stars, good for you I supposed. At the sake of what my friend hates people doing on Yelp, I seriously, desperately, crazily wanted to like this place. From Chuckeats to my foodie-tastic Yelp friends from home, everyone had been raving about this place and somehow I lucked out on scoring the last reservation on Independence day at 6 pm. Awesome! But that's pretty much where the good experience ended. I specifically spoke to the reservationist on the phone about bringing a fine bottle of $200 wine that I had been saving for this occasion. She neither mentioned their alcohol policy nor told me anything about my wine. Chicago is a BYOB centric town, so this was my expectation. When we first arrived, I brought out the bottle and one of the waiters stared at me and said ""We don't do that here."" It wasn't rude, it wasn't friendly, it wasn't polite but in the end he just looked at me like I was some dumb foreigner. I tried to explain that I had told the reservationist on the phone and no one told me it was a non-BYOB place. He got into an ARGUMENT with me over this, and in the end I had to say, you know, I will put it away. He basically captured the attention of the whole dining room area, so everyone was entertained I suppose. Classy. My goodness, if I were a restaurant that perhaps did not mention to the guest that they were not BYOB in a BYOB town, I would at least be nicer about it. Then, the food. We opted for wine because I wanted some but their choice was mediocre and the bottle was $100+ for .. mediocre. The food came, and it was a confusing string of random servers, not our server, and then our waiter changed, and then it was a waitress, and then I ended up having to ask for water 6 times. I expect this at Chili's, I don't expect to pay $600+ for a meal and have to ask them to refill my water when it's empty, not once, but 6 times. I expect consistency, the servers, the waiters, the people putting food in front of you. I expect them to know what they're talking about and if asked what the gelatin is made out of, I expect them to know. If they don't know, then they should ask and get back to me, not run away and not murmur a word. Who does that? Every dish was subpar because although it was elegantly presented, the flavors clashed, the play on traditional cooking did not work out and half of the time the waiters didn't bother to even tell us how to eat it. If you make it complicated with no instructions, perhaps we're not enjoying it correctly? In the end, even the main dish, the steak, I had high expectations, but mine was cold and the bf's was warm, hence ours were differently cooked thus did not taste the same even though we both opted for medium rare. When I got the bill, I just felt unsatisfied. I've been to restaurants fancier and pricier, I've been to other 3 Michelin stars and some 2 Michelin stars that deserve one more, but the food here did not do it for me, especially with all the confusion. The service was terrible, who argues with a guest and makes a scene in front of other guests? And the whole evening was stiffly subpar and awkward after the experience. Ugh. Will not be back. Will be heading to L2O this time."
136,"Alinea is not just about beautiful food, it's also about defeating the odds. The cuisine is: an idea realized. Visionary, resourceful, inspiring, and the work of an unforgiving workaholic. There is a reason why chefs around the world have voted him the best in the world - over and over again, and why even now, he continues to cram awards into his home. He is the best. Chef Grant, discovered he had tongue cancer just after his restaurant found global fame and respect, he was told he'd never taste again. A James Beard award winner (multiple times over), he began to rely on his sense of smell to know when his, now infamous, cuisine was reaching levels of endless perfection; that and his trusty sous chef - who operated as a taster... Grant became the Beethoven of cooking. Grant now is cancer free, and still presenting his art of no boundaries cuisine. ****Normally I'd post a list of the foods that rocked my world --- but the menu changes so often..I don't want to recommend a dish and have you not able to get your hands on it.**** Those that argue the price tag of this restaurant is high...I agree it's pricey, but MOST people have enough experience to know, that when go someplace fancy - you pay a fancy price. (it's $195, with tax and tip $252...for 21 courses! And made by the most talented chef in the world. ---- If you spend more than that on wine or cocktails - - that's your problem) So if you can embrace the price tag, and the fact it's a loooong meal (21-25 courses)...you'll have a fantastic time. Whatever the reason...go to celebrate life! TOP FIVE REASONS TO GO TO ALINEA: 1) Culinary art and taste at it's height 2) Feel like your dining at Iron Chef but better 3) Charming yet pretentious service (let's face it when you pay alot of money you don't want the charming yet ""chatty cathy"" waiter) 4) Fantastic wine list 5) Warm yet modern environment THE TOP FIVE REASONS NOT TO GO TO ALINEA: 1) Price (for the those less experienced with fine dining, this will seem like a lot of money - but for what you get, it's fine(it's $195, with tax and tip $252...for 21 courses! And made by the most talented chef in the world. ---- If you spend more than that on wine or cocktails - - that's your problem) 2) If you are a picky eater this will be your worst nightmare 3) Parking can be tedious on the weekend 4) They do frown upon those that want to pick the menu apart ""eg: make my fish, tofu instead, and bring me a side of mayo instead of the sauce it comes with"" 5) Reservations can be hard to get sometimes."
137,"- An experience you need to try in your lifetime. Before going there, you may think paying that much money (cost $520 for 2) is a mistake even if it is the 7th best restaurant in the world, but you'll soon see you are mistaken! I even thought it was cheap when I left there! - The staff were friendly and I didn't expect that. I thought everything will be super formal but it was not like that. - I went there at 9:30pm (the latest time they accept you) and were there till 1:00am on a weekday. It was a mistake. Reserve an earlier time if you want to fully enjoy it or go there on weekend. - The items are small but there are 20 of them. Don't eat anything beforehand otherwise you'll regret it. - There is no sign saying valet parking or anything like that, but you'll see the guys on the street who will take care of finding a spot for parking. Just tell them you are going to Alinea. - The menu will be given to you at the end. If Grant Achatz the great chef is not there that night, give them your address with the menu and he'll sign it and they'll mail it you."
138,"More than a month after my meal, I've decided I really do need to dock some Yelp stars from Alinea to average it out to four stars. What is the purpose of fine dining? Food at its simplest is a means of sustenance but most chefs aspire to something greater than that - an experience, a revelation, a burst of emotion. In the moment, that experience is mostly pleasure and sensation. Later, long after the meal has been consumed, only memory remains. Herein lies the problem: my memory of Alinea will almost always be tainted. Without written or visual aids, I have only a vague recollection of the subtleties of flavor, smell and texture. I remember - in the abstract sense - the meal being technically and aesthetically brilliant, but the overwhelming emotion is one of disappointment. The initial adrenaline rush of meeting Chef Achatz is gone, elation over discovering new flavor combinations somewhat muted, and what was a merely frustrating 5-minute interaction has now evolved into a dark cloud hanging over the memory of an otherwise delicious meal. The human mind has a tendency to become more fixed over time; opinions are stronger, less subject to shades of gray. A few sentences of somewhat patronizing preamble to the meal can have outsized impact in the long run that not even the talents of Achatz's team can counteract. I'll return one day, still a lightweight but not quite so young. I wonder if I will be treated differently. I hope that, in the meantime, Alinea will learn not to judge a book by its cover."
139,"This was my second time dining here. The first was on Halloween, 2009. I decided to start a new tradition of very fine dining on Halloween, an adult indulgence on a day ordinarily reserved for children. The first meal became the best meal of my life (and I have been to a lot of places). The second meal was just as memorable if not more so.This time it was in celebration of my 17th year anniversary with my partner. We flew from San Francisco just for the night, just to dine at Alinea. That is how highly I regard this restaurant. Back to SF in the morning feeling we truly had experienced magic."
140,"My wife and I ate here on 04/06, and I have to say, this was far and away the dining experience of my life. If I could give it 10 stars, I would! Everyone will tell you about the food. The creativity of the presentations (I ate a BALLOON!), the intense flavors in each course (I could have had about a dozen of the razor clams, or black truffle explosions, or a gallon of hot potato/cold potato, or the lamb course), or the the dessert finale (presented at our table by Chef de Cuisine Matt Chasseur), the food is truly spectacular. What I would like to highlight is the service. Going in, you know it's a truly world-class restaurant, from the 3 Michelin stars, critical acclaim, internet reviews across the internet, and so forth. What you won't know about is what it's like to actually be there. Once you are there, you find that the service is exceptionally down to earth, and at the same time, disarmingly precise. I loved that they weren't afraid to laugh with you (custom ""hot pot"" picker-uppers), and at the same time serve your dishes as if it were a Russian ballet. Of course it all does come with a price, but once you go, you are left wondering ""how the heck am I going to get back here?"" I'm still trying to figure it out!"
141,"Best food in town. Alinea is definitely an experience everyone should try at least once. Amazing food and service that can't be beat. It can be difficult to get reservations for desired times, but Alinea is definitely worth planning an evening around."
142,"The experience at Alinea is almost one that you don't want to taint by bringing it to words. We took photos of our courses as they came through to try to be able to describe to others later what was going on, but it was almost like the photos didn't do any justice to the sublime amazing journey that one goes on while going through all of the courses. It's almost like a whole new world is opened up to me... yet all food is now slightly ruined and will never be as good."
143,"Three months after dining here, I've finally been able to bring myself to review Alinea - and give it the same number of stars as the Michelin Guide, though on a different scale. Is the food delicious? Yes. Is it creative? Probably the most creative dining experience I'll ever have. How was the service? Impeccable. Was it worth the ridiculous price tag? Only because it somehow raises my credibility during conversation when I note that I've eaten there - and that's not my modus operandi. If you're a foodie with the budget that would allow you to indulge in a 3-star Michelin restaurant, then undoubtedly you will be extremely satisfied with your decision to dine at Alinea. But if you're a casual diner who enjoys great food and pleasurable dining experiences, you'll likely be be left wondering how you ever thought it would be okay to pay this much for 21 courses of food you probably won't be able to describe without a photo to back up your explanation of such things as a crisp of reconstituted pineapple juice dusted with bacon. One might say that casual diners lack the sophisticated palate of a true foodie, which may be true. But one might also say that you can have outstanding dining experiences for 1/6 of the cost; put another way, with the astounding number of excellent dining options in Chicago, you can indulge in six of them for the price of one unique night at Alinea."
144,"The French Laundry of the Midwest. The food is different but the experience is just as superb. Of course the focus here is on molecular gastronomy. There is only one option when dining at Alinea- you'll have the 21-course (give or take a few) prix fixe menu, which will run you roughly $300. If you want the wine pairing, add in another $150. Trust me, it'll be worth it. You'll leave drunker than a sorority girl, but a happy one. There is no menu, and everyone at your table will have the exact same thing. If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, be sure to let them know up front. You'll start with some frozen cocktail creations, with just a touch of alcohol in each. Other than this, there is no liquor so don't ask for a martini. Then you'll move on to a few cold dishes and progress into the bigger, meatier dishes (including rabbit and a piece of venison, which was soooo good). Try to keep count if you can, so you can pace yourself accordingly. If you eat everything on your plate, you might be too full to enjoy the last several courses. The dessert presentation is absolutely spectacular and unrivaled by anywhere else I've been. All in all, expect to be there at least 3 hours, closer to 4. Bring good company, hungry bellies, a thirst for creative dishes that you'll never see anywhere else, and hopefully- your company's credit card or a sugar daddy."
145,"Had the extreme pleasure of a second visit to Alinea this weekend for my Mom's birthday with special guest, Caroline A. Impeccably impressive as always to say the least. If you haven't had the opportunity to get to Alinea yet, try as you must to do so! The culinary tour is undeniably mind blowing, but their newest concept which brings the wonderment of the kitchen at Alinea right to you with the 'Chocolate' dessert finale is truly unbelievable. Plated right on your table by Grant himself, or his insanely talented Exec Chef, Matt, it is an experience of the highest caliber in sensory mind-meld. They have also made a few minor tweaks since my last visit which should be noted. First up, they are no longer offering 2 menu size selections (""taste"" and ""tour""), they have gone to an exclusive 20 course full tour only format. They also have upped their game, if that's even possible, and now do bring a special individualized course to the table acknowledging special events and such. Way to improve the unimprovable! I can't say enough good things."
146,"Take a bite out of some contemporary art. Alinea is an extraordinary dining experience. I loved every second of Alinea and would highly recommend this for an intimate dining experience. The service was impeccable. Some tips: . . . . . You'll need to book your reservation months in advance. . . . . . Chill out. Do not make after dinner plans. To truly enjoy the experience you'll want to relax and not be cognizant of time . . . . . Do enjoy the wine pairing. After all, you're already spending a few hundo on dinner, might as well go all out. . . . . . If you have to choose between Moto & Alinea, I'd pick Alinea every time."
147,"Simply put, Amazing. Nothing is what you expect it to be. It is almost all exquisite, out of 18 courses there is only one that i could honestly say I didn't feel was incredible, that said I would still happily gorge on it. The creativity and complexity of flavors.. the paired scents that accompany many dishes as well as the active participation required in others all adds up to something that I never expected to experience. This is truly on another level, it makes other 3 star restaurants like Le Bernardin appear boring and uninspired. If you can, ask for Richard to be your sommelier, he is as eccentric as the food and adds flair to an already exhilarating performance."
148,"For the adventurous foodie, Alinea provides one of the most unique and deliciously entertaining tasting experiences that lasts the whole night. From the moment you enter the modern unassuming dining room, you're greeted with a friendly staff who delight in presenting your dishes. Each course plays out theatrically in unexpected sensational ways. I hesitated to touch these ""food sculptures"", because they're unlike anything I've seen let alone eaten. But they encourage you to play with your food, explore it's textures and tastes. Whether it was a frozen pea soup that melted in your mouth, or dessert served on a rapidly deflating pillow of earl grey essence, you're rewarded simply for participating. The night which began with low key chatter grew livelier as fellow diners shared their dining experiences with the rest of the room. This is perhaps the closest thing to interactive dinner theater, because the enjoyment comes as much from the tasting as it does from revealing."
149,"(Not much I say here isn't going to be echoed by previous reviewers, which was part of why I wasn't planning on reviewing this place. Also note that shortly after I went they changed the menu from the Tour and Tasting versions to a single Tour) A vanilla bean being used as a serving utensil may be one of the most over the top bits of presentation possible, but it served a particular purpose in the dish and that is part of why Alinea is great. Even having some idea of what to expect, this still blew me away. The creative effort, the sheer volume of involvement necessary, the service, all of it, was spectacular. As for the food itself, it's ineffable to encompass it all here, but short of it all is, I am inspired to be more fearless with my cooking just to try and find some of the joy and surprise I had during the meal. Of course, I'd have to be insanely talented and a lot richer before I can get close to some of the stuff they do. Out of the entire meal two dishes were a miss...not spectacular, not terrible, just not in line with the rest of my experience. The rest were very good to purely amazing. I think the look on my face after several bites probably made the wait staff worry if both my hands were above the table. They're probably used to that by now, though.....I hope. I can see this not being the kind of place everyone would enjoy due to its involved nature and their playfulness with presentation/instruction/flavor. Much like other places of this caliber, I recommend you go if you get the chance."
150,"I traveled to Chicago in December, in the winter, in the cold, and with wind. Why? Alinea. I only agreed to go because Alinea was in Chicago and I wanted some good eats. We arrived at the front steps on Alinea and was greeted by a doorman that opened the door. We walked in only seeing walls and no door. So what did we do? We continued walking and prayed for a door to appear. All of a sudden *poof* a secret door slid open on the left and we walked through and was greeted by a hostess. We waited a few minutes while our table was being set up and took a glimpse of the kitchen. The kitchen was immaculate and things were moving like clock work. While walking upstairs to our table I saw that the room was very modern and minimal with a touch of techno . I don't know. It's hard to explain. We were seated, greeted, and given a snippet of what was to come. The menu was not given to us because they wanted it to be more of a surprise. Once situated, the meal began and we were served 22 courses of gastronomically incredible dishes. Some favorites were: Yuba, shrimp, miso, togarashi. Rabbit, parfait, rillette, consomme Hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter Short rib, olive, red wine, blackberry Black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan Venison, lingonberry, gruyere, fireplace kindling Spruce peppermint tea Everything was amazing. There was one dish that caught me off guard and I must share the experience. So a plate was presented to us with a mountain of shaved ice and an oyster shell on top with a leaf on top of the shell. I saw oyster and was somewhat hesitant because I don't like oysters BUT I was going to say no to it. So I lifted up the leaf to see that there was no oyster. I was like, ""dude, where's my oyster?"" Our server explained to us that the leaf is grown in Scotland and it tastes just like oysters. I ate my leafy oyster and guess what?! It tasted exactly like and oyster. Legendary. The meal overall was amazing. It was a heavy price to pay but the food and experience was worth every penny. The service was phenomenal. Everyone was really nice and they all had a witty sense of humor. This dining experience was interactive, exciting, and definitely memorable."
151,"Meh. I've experienced better, here and elsewhere. The first time was a treat. This time around it felt like a chore. Service was impersonal. The food was uninspiring, even pedestrian. The wine pairing was alright. It feels like Alinea has lost its magic and focus. I left underwhelmed."
152,"There are enough reviews here to demonstrate just how spectacular this place is... I won't waste your time with raving and keep it simple and short. Very innovative food concepts. Highly memorable dishes with flavors that will haunt you for life. Customer service and the experience itself is ridiculously professional and top notch. A few parting thoughts: Hot Potato, Cold Potato Black Truffle Explosion Golden Trout Roe These three dishes have left me ruined for life... I'm not sure I can eat anything else that will measure up to just how wonderful they were... have you ever eaten something so good, that it made you want to smile... and then break out into an uncontrolled laugh? That's what these few dishes did for me.... Yes it's pricey, but let's be honest... we go out and enjoy food, and pay probably $35 a meal. So if you can resist going out not even 10 times, you will have the opportunity to experience one of the greatest meals of your life. I have. And I will not forget it soon..."
153,"The very second I got back to my hotel room I wanted to review this place. But I practiced restraint and thought better of it and knew it would be best to think this through. Alinea is a 3 star Michelin rated restaurant and worthy of it's praise and plethora of 5 star reviews. Buuuuut, I write reviews for me and this is about me and I write reviews for two reasons. Number 1, to support places I really believe in (see Toto review) and 2. To give the MANY readers of my reviews a fair snapshot of what to expect. With this being said, if you love steak and baked potatoes and do not consider yourself an adventurous eater do not even think of dining here. If the thought of pigeon parts and flaming tree branches brought to your table make you cringe do yourself a favor and make a reservation at Ruth Chris instead. This place is a culinary adventure full of twists and turns which will challenge your taste buds. 27 interesting and ""what the hec is that"" courses placed in front of you that made me feel like I was back in school and studied each complex flavor and trying to figure out which ingredients are in each dish. Actually ""dish"" isn't accurate, each course is just a mere taste. But trust me, that's what you want here. The dining room is easily the quietest I have ever been in. I felt like I was in a library during finals weeks. Usually I equate a quiet dining room with a stuffy or intimate setting. This was a mix of the two, I did not feel at all uncomfortable and found it be a nice experience. Other reviews describe this place is being innovative and groundbreaking. It might be here, but the food preparation reminded me a place back in UK which the name escapes me at the moment. Was it the Fat Duck? Big Duck? Awkward Duck? I am pretty sure it had Duck in there somewhere. In the end I can honestly say this place is a 5 star restaurant but I am not giving it five stars even though it deserves it. My main reason for not doing this is fearing that I send someone here who comes away disappointed. Bubbles has a sophisticated palate and would absolutely love it. My friend who lives up the street in a house with no furniture and empty pizza boxes on the kitchen counter not so much."
154,"So sorry, 3 hours of overpriced food and waitstaff being so serious, cool and somber I felt like I was being served by morticians. 2 of us and $900 dollars later, never again. I can see the effort put in by the kitchen yet not worth it for me. The one strange thing to me is most everyone rates this place so highly. Maybe just a few of you feel that if you didn't rate it well you were out of sync or didn't appreciate the cuisine."
155,"So first, me in a nutshell: - Will eat anything - Never been to Michelin restaurant before this - Even writes Yelp reviews for McDonald's As you can see, I don't exactly have the most refined taste. In fact, I hadn't even heard about Alinea until a few months ago, and I never in a million years expected to find myself here, athough I've drooled over the yelp pictures quite a few times. So I was literally speechless when my boyfriend brought me here for a belated birthday dinner, making me the luckiest girl ever :) PROS: Everything, which is something that I rarely say. My expectations for Alinea were through the roof to begin with, and high expectations are rarely met, not to mention exceeded. 1) Service - top notch. Humor/social-skills are definitely part of the servers' job description because everyone we encountered was personable and funny. They also seemed to have an innate sixth sense (or they were just eavesdropping constantly) because it was like they could tell when we needed to get up for the restroom. We even got a quick tour of the kitchen after our meal. 2) Decor - stunning. It felt like we were in a museum and we were afraid to touch anything. I hope my future house will be this pretty. 3) Favorite dishes - I was trying to pick a single favorite but gave up. - Venison: interactive make-your-own wrap. I had no idea what venison was until my bf explained that it was deer :( It's super tasty though. - Apple: piece of breaded brie/apple/onion skewered by a cinnamon stick. I'm going to go burn cinnamon sticks for decorations now. - Scup: family-style olive salad, chickpea chips, mint sauce, and a WHOLE fish. We were confused by this course since it's completely different from Alinea's otherwise minimalist style. Loved the salad and chips, and the fish was very tender. - Dark Chocolate: pumpkin ice cream-filled dark chocolate pinata. I'm a fan of all things pumpkin so I'm almost required to love this. This was the last course and although I was bursting inside, I kept wanting another spoonful. - Notable courses: scallop shaped like tofu (what is this nonsense), a bunch of spoons with different items on each (flavors meant to complement one another), a squid dish named ""woolly pig"" (confusing name), an ice sculpture (which was actually a course), and peppermint snow sitting on really cold rocks (I accidentally touched the rocks, ow). CONS: - Oyster leaf tasted like a leaf to me... - Too much truffle. Which isn't really a complaint because that's like a kid complaining about too much sweets. - A few of the dishes sauces were a touch too salty Overall, I'm thankful for an amazing experience. Now I'm going to go work off those 3000 calories."
156,"Oh Alinea... how I love thee... let me count the ways.... Where to even begin? Oh, i know. ALINEA WAS THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! Take note that I didn't say best meal.... oh, the meal was only part of it. Dining at Alinea is truly an experience. I love the way Chef Grant Achatz takes you on a culinary journey where the focus is on food as a performance piece. Engaging the diners, making them feel connected to his meal. It was wonderful. I wish i could afford this kind of culinary pleasure more than once. Very deserving of its 3-Michellin star rating!"
157,"It's no coincidence that Alinea has three michelin stars and is the number one restaurant in America. I came here after two long months of anticipation. We had a reservation at 9:30 so we finished our meal around 12:45. Service at first was kind of awkward and the server kept mumbling his words. After they knew that we weren't some uptight twenty year olds, they loosened up and made it a fun time. Although not every course was perfect, probably 19 out of the 22 courses were simply mindblowing. I won't go into detail on the food because I could probably write a five page paper on each dish, but everything was either great to life changing. My favorite dishes were the halibut, black truffle explosion, rabbit rillete-parfait-consomme, hot potato cold potato, wild mushrooms and the mindblowing dessert finale. The two dishes I feel were not perfectly executed was the escoffier inspired dish. It was lamb and it was pretty cold and chewy. I expected it to be hot and melt in your mouth tender, but it seemed like it was sitting out awhile. The venison in the eucalyptus was also not perfect. The venison was pretty overcooked. From pictures I saw, it looked to be cooked medium rare, but mine was rather tough and more cooked medium-well. That being said, they were still pretty great. The service was also spot on and I liked the beer progression. So is it worth it? I think it is absolutely worth it. Although one could not dine there very often, I recommend you at least try it once to see the possibilities of what can be done with food. I would say wherever you come from, Alinea is worth the trip alone. People say it is a once in a lifetime experience, but I am excited to say that I will be back many times in my lifetime. Enjoy."
158,"Do it once, spend the money, and dream about the hot potato cold potato and the black truffle explosion. Suggestions: 1. Book an early dining reservation (i.e. 5 p.m.) It's worth it to eat at the Senior Citizen hour, because you'll be the first in the dining room to be surprised by each course. The presentation of the courses would lose its luster if four other tables were ""ooh-ing"" and ""ahh-ing"" long before you got it. 2. Skip on the wine pairings. If you're going to spend $800 for two people, you think -- might as well splurge on the wine pairings... but I found it cluttered by taste buds."
159,"Alinea, oh yes. I would go here every week if i could, it is so great. From the insanely coiffed sommelier who knows wine as if it flows in his veins, to the extremely knowledgeable waiters, to the serious chef who comes out to prepare the incredible piece of art that becomes an orgy of a dessert....flawless. Grant Achatz is undisputably a genius. Usually i am pretty wordy in my reviews but Alinea left me sort of speechless and awestruck, if that tells you anything. It's been a month and a half since we ate there and I still think about it and wonder if I'll ever go there again, and find myself plotting ways to get back to Chicago, if only for one more meal here."
160,"Since my first review, I went back here on one other occasion. It lived up to its hype the second time. Service was still very attentive, but less stuffy. The biggest difference was I enjoyed the tastes of almost every course on the second visit whereas on the first visit, I thought over half the dishes were misses based on my personal preferences. Presentation was once again over the top in a good way. After being wowed on my second visit, I would come back here anytime. The best dish on my second visit was the dessert that was assembled on the dining table. It was a work of art and delicious!"
161,"After going to this place, how could anything else ever impress me again? When I went to Alinea, I had been traveling all over the country due to my job and was eating out almost every day. I enjoy good food, but at some point I was starting to experience restaurant fatigue at every ""fancy or great"" place I was going to. (Great, the steak tasted amazing, the fish was awesome, so on and so forth, but I felt like I'd seen the same ""twists"" at other restaurants). Alinea was able to take my taste buds on a REAL adventure. It was like if you were straight edge and then all of a sudden you took acid. My world exploded. The food. As others have mentioned, this is molecular gastronomy... which means most of the time you have no idea what you are eating. It's abstract art in edible form. But whatever comes out is whimsical and different from what you've experienced before. We went for the 24 course meal. Should have heeded the warning to NOT get the wine flight. They don't skimp on refilling your glass. We were so full and uncoordinated I felt like someone needed to carry me out of the restaurant. The service: impeccable. Our sommelier and waiter were charming and extraordinarily patient with us, considering we were the last ones to leave the restaurant and also were generally making asses out of ourselves. (See above statement about NOT GETTING THE WINE FLIGHT to make sure you do not end up us.) Playing Lady Gaga loudly over your iPhone for 30 seconds and asking what wine goes best with Filet-O-Fish is probably something that would get you kicked out of an establishment like this, yet somehow these folks managed to remain friendly and down-to-earth-best-Midwest-nice-without-being-overbearing. Also, who would have thought it, but this is fine dining at its most accommodating: 1. One of our party is vegan, and the kitchen made all 24 of his courses vegan friendly. I was extremely impressed with the results. For example, when the rest of our group got the infamous ""bacon on a swing"" dish, our veg friend got a dish that looked exactly like it. It was an apple slice, carved to look like a piece of bacon. Yes, I am easily amused. 2. If Grant Achatz is there, he will sign your menu. (Squeal now, foodies!) And even if he isn't, apparently you can ask for him to sign it anyways and then Alinea will mail it to you. Don't say I didn't warn you: anything you eat for weeks after going to Alinea is just going to taste like unflavored oatmeal."
162,"Once my husband shared with me the 50 best in the world list, we eyed all the restaurants in the US and had to make reservations at Alinea. This was my first tasting menu experience so before arriving, I was incredibly nervous about what we'd be eating... would I like it? Would I really like it? Or would I just convince myself that I was enjoying it because of the price tag. I am happy to report that Alinea did not disappoint. We had 22 courses, 15 presentations and with every one, we were blown away. Highlights * Getting to play with my food (and being encouraged to do so!) * My favorite dishes: Hot potato cold potato, hamachi, short rib, and of course the chocolate mousse. * The staff was so knowledgeable and yet down to earth * Personalized Menu (my husband had an ""abbreviated"" wine tasting, and the menu even reflected this!) We were so lucky to get Chef Grant to make our dessert. I don't know if any restaurant can top that!"
163,"Dear Alinea, I must thank you for the best experience I have had in my entire life. The service was outstanding!!! the wine pairings were divine. For a 26 year old; I feel blessed to have eaten at a place like Alinea. We had a 16 course dinner that left me wondering if Grant Atchatz was secretly god himself! For the people who complain about prices...... you are all extremely stupid!!!!!!! Of course this is going to me an extreme amount of money but to ""be honest"" the food was completely worth it. And I have to disagree with Jeanus when she said this is bad place for first date- If my gf took me here I would marry her on the spot!!!! Yes and thats after only 2 glasses of wine:) Thank you Alinea, Sincerely Mike"
164,"Disney land for your mouth. The bad: We were kinda stuck in a corner where the only way for my dinner companion to get out was for them to move the table. Our primary waiter was very proper. Although I list it as bad, it added an elitist vibe that let us know that he took his job very seriously. Food secret service serious. The good: The wait staff was totally on the ball and my glass was only half full once. Everything was immaculately clean. It looked like an OCD person came and cleaned it just before we arrived. If something had fallen on the floor, I would have been totally comfortable eating it regardless. The decorations were warm and friendly. I wish my house looked that nice. The great: The front hallway lets you know that you are in for something special. I tasted things that I will never taste anywhere else ever again. Everything was presented in a way that was a fusion of art and science. I wanted to take a photo of every dish they brought out but I was scared I would look like a tourist. One of the waiters said ""We are all food nerds here."" and laughed like a boy about to do something really wild. I was jealous of how much he enjoyed his job. The dessert was prepared directly on the table cloth by the head chef... on the table... no plates, bowls, or saucers... on the special table cloth. Blow torches and liquid nitrogen were included in the process... Mad scientist kinda stuff going on here. A few people on Yelp have said that this is a once in a lifetime experience. Damn the cost, we will be back when they change the menu. I am a customer for life."
165,"Hands down, unequivocally, the best meal I have had to date. 20 courses of sheer, amazing, inventive, creative, artfully prepared foodie goodness. Every course has the plate, bowl, etc. custom made just for serving that specific dish. Talk about paying attention to the details! - Steelhead Roe - Yuba - Oyster Leaf - Scallops - Razor Clam - Foie Gras - Venison - Rabbit (parfait, rillette, and consomme) - Wild Mushrooms - Hot Potato - Short Rib (this was a handmade pasta that you prepare yourself... like a taco) - Hamachi - Agneau - Black Truffles - Yuzu Snow (wild) - Sweet Potato - Lemongrass (a shot in a test tube... and have you ever even heard of finger lime?) And then for the kicker, Grant Achatz himself came out and prepared out chocolate/blueberry/honey/peanut/etc dessert-as-artwork on our table top. This course was certainly the highlight of the meal and watching the chef painstakingly work to paint each drop very specifically was quite fun. The wine pairings are phenomenal and everything in the wine was as playful and interesting as the food it was paired with. If I could only eat out once a year, it would be at Alinea."
166,"I don't know where to start. This is not my first molecular gastronomy experience, and I'm sure won't be my last. I can not wait to go back! The service was amazing, they really made sure we had a wonderful experience. They relaxed us right away and set the stage for a wonderful evening. I hesitate to go into great detail about the meal, as with molecular gastronomy experiences, the journey is a big part of the whole. Suffice to say, every single course they brought out left me wanting more simply because it tasted so good. The wine pairings were perfectly done and when I left, even though I was full, I wanted more. I do believe we will be back, during another season to see what they have to offer, say when it's truffle season again or some such :)"
167,"My fiance took me to Alinea for my birthday, and it was definitely a once in a lifetime dining experience. Two weeks later I am still talking about it and showing pictures to anyone who will listen. Each course was completely unique and played with your sense of sight, smell and taste. We opted to not do the wine parings, and I am glad we made that decision. Both of us were so full by the end, we could barely finish the one glass of wine we'd each ordered. Plus, if you're a light weight like me, you'd be so drunk by the end that you wouldn't get to fully enjoy the final courses (the wine pairings amount to approximately 4 glasses per person). I loved the fact, too, that the wait staff had a sense of humor. You could tell they love what they do and take the food they are serving very seriously. But, they all had a dry sense of humor that kept things light and fun. This was a dining experience I will never forget, and is easily the best dinner I have ever had."
168,"I have literally changed my rating from 4 to 5 and back again at least 10 times. What I struggle with in rating Alinea is whether or not food should be evaluated as art. Powerful visual art is not always pleasant to look at, but it doesn't matter because its purpose isn't always pleasure. Maybe this makes me unsophisticated, but I cannot shake the feeling that eating is a more basic, hedonistic pleasure than other art forms and therefore should be evaluated on the basis of sensory experience alone and not sensory+cerebral experience. There is no doubt that the food at Alinea is provocative and that the experience of dining there is absolutely extraordinary. BUT, some parts of my meal were unmemorable or flat out weird, and I don't know if I can ignore that. Dining at Alinea is more like going to a modern art show than eating at a restaurant--the experience is meant to play with your senses, confuse you, and challenge you to think differently about food. It absolutely accomplishes all of those things. The restaurant itself was designed in such a way that you felt isolated from the rest of the world and oblivious to the passing of time. The service was impeccable-- the server even noticed that I'm a lefty and adjusted his service accordingly. Some parts of the meal were more delicious than anything I've ever tasted in my life (e.g. Black Truffle Explosion, Hot Potato). Other parts, though, were conceptually and experientially interesting but I found the flavors to be too weird to be enjoyable (e.g. Bubblegum). Don't get me wrong, though, I am extremely grateful I went and the meal is still one of the best I've ever had...It's just hard for me to proclaim it ""as good as it gets,"" especially given the small fortune it cost me to eat there."
169,"I know, I know, this review is very late. My husband and I decided to celebrate our wedding half-anersary here and I must say, it was a really really good experience. Everything was en pointe and nothing beats having grant achatz plate the whole table with our dessert! here's our video: http://www.youtube.com/u and here's photos of everything we ate. http://www.flickr.com/ph a word from the wise: grant achatz loves truffles, and a lot of what we ate had truffles in them - and if you dont like the earthy, vomit inducing flavor - tell them. we were ""suffering"" through all the trufflecentric dishes. GO!"
170,"I was in between giving this place a two and a three star rating. 2.5 Really cool entrance way. I felt like I was walking in a shrinking hallway, a la Willy Wonka. The gentleman that greeted us at the front door was kinda rude. I typically do not put reservations under my last name because it is difficult to spell and a tad long. Usually I use my partners last name. So when he asked for the name on the reservation, I automatically gave my partners. No. Try my last name. No. Some confusion ensued. The reservation was under my name but it took about 5 minutes for him to find it and this guy kept insisting they did not have our reservation. This was my birthday and the restaurant is a special treat so I was starting to panic a bit. Fine, things happen, but I felt like he acted like this was my fault and he was rude and snobby about it and he did not apologize. Bad start. Dining room service was nice. Several servers came by our table throughout the night and they were all professional with a bit of humor thrown in. Our waitress was a little soft spoken but did not mind answering any questions or repeating herself when asked. I liked that she not only listed the ingredients in the dishes but she also explained how to eat the courses that were served in nontraditional manners. Decor was very minimal but pretty. I wish they played music in the dining room. Awkward silence. I really don't want to hear the conversation from the table across the room. Also, the dining room was freezing. Our waitress said they were having problems with the heater and brought me a pashmina. The girl at the table across also requested one so I know it wasn't just me. Seriously, my toes were numb. Not cool when we are shelling out around $300 per person. The food was interesting, theatrical, creative beyond creative. The presentations were some of the most creative I have ever seen. Taste wise though, most were just OK. Several dishes, 3 or 4, were overly salty. I like salt but it should enhance the flavor of food not BE the flavor. Very few dishes made me say, 'Wow. This tastes amazing.' Most were just good. Not great. For my taste, there were way to many dessert courses. Four or five I think. The grand finale dessert literally covered the entire table and I was already so done with sweet flavors. I didn't even really want to eat it, even though it was the best one. I kinda felt sick by that point! The sommelier asked what we were going to drink. I did not want to do the tasting and he suggested I go with a glass of champagne. He was pleasant and not pushy about the wine tasting. I was a little surprised when the bill arrived. I believe the most expensive glass of champagne on the menu was $18 but somehow we were charged $25 per glass. Hmmm. Alinea is definitely a unique dining experience. You will see and experience food here in a way that is unlike any other restaurant. I had fun and Alinea made this a memorable birthday. (I do not think I would have enjoyed it if we did not have a $500 gift card!) Overall, I just found the flavors to be lacking and have no desire to return. While I appreciate pretty and creative presentations, to me the taste of the food is what makes a great dish. This place just didn't rock my world the way I expected."
171,"Yelping Alinea seems stupid, since it's universally accepted as the best restaurant in Chicago, if not the country, but I do have one thing I would like to contribute to the discussion, on the subject of price, particularly for those who have never been before. I want to add that you cannot compare the expense to prior dining experiences, but rather to some other entertainment, or even travel. Here's a scenario: you get a couple choice tickets to the theater, orchestra, Hawks game, whatever ($200?), have a reasonably priced meal with wine for two before or after ($150?). There. You're about at the price for two for Alinea, and since Alinea dining averages four hours, you've spent the same amount of time either night. Compare the price to that, not to that of your (current) favorite restaurant. And I'm willing to bet that Alinea would be the one of the two options above that you remember for the rest of your life. It's definitely more out of this world. My wife and I do not have money fights. She's a teacher, I'm a community college mid-level administrator. We made it work to come here, twice, by not dining out for a few weeks in a row and giving up booze each time, which is not exactly a sacrifice in order to afford something for which there exists simply no other comparable or approximate experience. Alinea is not another restaurant - it's its own type of satisfaction. A digressing note to any Alinea employee potentially reading this. Off the bat, you all do perfect work, thank you for doing so much to really enhance the first and second best dining experiences I've ever had. I admire your memory capabilities, agility juggling dishes and superlative commitment to service. It is in the most constructive vein that I suggest you stop the practice of pretending to remember - to the very date even -- the last time a customer dined at your restaurant. It's at best cute when you open a food explanation with a pseudo-spontaneous ""I believe when you were here last April, the 12th was it, when you had the..."" Especially when you did not serve us last time. Maybe some CRM research shows other diners think you really remembered them and appreciate the fleeting specialness, but I doubt it. And nothing else you do is transparent."
172,"I went in expecting that I would want to get a taco after leaving. I was thankfully wrong. The food was amazing - even things that I normally would turn my nose up at (truffles I'm looking at you) tasked shockingly good. The wine pairings were well matched and delicious. I am currently working on forgetting what good wine tastes like. The service was good, but neutral - which I think is the point because the meal is supposed to be about the food not the service or decor. Would I go again? Yes. Would I go again soon? Probably not. Since so much of the experience is trying the strange concoctions I feel like it would be a waste to try the same menu again. I'll wait a few years, and then return."
173,A fine dining experience with a theatrical flare equipped with entertaining and informative staff. The food will have you trying to secure another reservation to experience it all again! I agree with another reviewer - you get back what you give out in terms of personality. The staff are very professional! I can go back just to laugh with them again. The food is ridiculously amazing without getting technical; captivating and taste absolutely divine!
174,"So sorry for such a late review but I'd been procrastinating in joining Yelp for the longest. This was, incontrovertibly, the top of my list for creativity and food. It is second only to Daniel in NYC (http://www.danielnyc.com) for the amount of scratch I'd spent in one sitting. No need to go through the courses as it changes periodically. Just go with an open mind and you'll be rewarded with something celestial. If you are in Chicago and want to splurge on an extraordinary experience? Alinea is your best bet. You shan't forget it."
175,"Best meal I've ever had in my life. Each of the 20 courses were innovative and thoughtful, perfectly executed. I felt like a child, receiving each course like a surprise birthday gift. You all will not be able to choose your dishes and the element of surprise is so delightful that I'm not going to reveal any of them. Just enjoy true artistry."
176,"This restaurant is a like museum for the taste buds. It's more about exploring culinary sensations than filling your stomach (though by the end of my meal, I was perfectly full.. not stuffed, not still hungry, just wonderfully satisfied) So don't expect to absolutely love everything, but definitely expect everything to be an amazing experience. The service here defines fine dining. There was always a server nearby.. not hovering, but ready to approach if needed. They were courteous, cognizant of their customers needs, and just all around fabulous. The level of service rounded out an incredible culinary experience making this one of my most memorable dining events."
177,"I'll give the food 5 full stars, but the overall rating of Alinea I will give only 4 because the service in the beginning was actually pretty rude. My parents took me here as part of my college graduation present and I was stoked about it. So yes, I may be a little bias as I'm probably way too young to really understand what it is to go fine dining. But I digress. While I was walking to our table when we first got seated, I wanted to let my parents sit on the booth side so they'd be more comfortable, but as I was pulling my chair out one of the guys grabbed the chair from me and sternly goes, ""NO, miss. You aren't sitting here. You're sitting in the booth."" Wow. Thanks douche. I was just trying to be a considerate daughter by letting the parentals have the more comfortable seats. Didn't realize you loved your budding career as a seating guy so much... Anyway, after that it was all uphill as the courses and wine pairings we got were amazing. Let me tell you, It's very Willy Wonka in that kitchen haha. One of our desserts was served to us in a tube on a hot towel called a ""bubblegum shot"" and there was tapioca and pink stuff in it. Like I said, I'm no fine dining pro. I call it like it is. A tube with pink stuff in it. And it was delicious. The food and presentation really was amazing, but that credit goes to Willy Wonka Chef Grant, not the douchey seating guy. Man was he a douche. Whatever, he's just a seating guy. I got eye-raped while walking to the bathroom too by one of their tiny little dishwasher guys. It was quite creepy. Guess they all find their way into the fine dining world one way or another. My fault for wearing heels and a leopard print skirt to dinner, I guess? At the end of the night the douchebaggery and eye-raping was worth it because my parents love fine dining and could not stop raving about each course. They fell in love with this place. As long as they're happy I'm happy. Can't have it all!"
178,"This will be unlike any other meal you've ever eaten or experienced (price wise too). I give points to Alinea for the creativity and uniqueness in the dishes: a short rib ravioli with the tomato wrapper being the ""flag"" centerpiece, fried pheasant served off burning leaves, a shortbread dessert served on a pillow that deflates as you eat, releasing earl grey and vanilla aroma. The presentation is captivating and refreshing. A couple of themes that emerged throughout our 21 course meal were explosions (the black truffle ravioli; gush of apple juice in a horseradish sphere in celery juice, served as a shot; the way our complimentary bday truffes burst open when vanilla ice crema was poured on top of it) and entrees meant to be eaten in one bite (hot potato shooter with butter; edible cocktails). For $250 for this dinner, service was impeccable, as expected. Overall, though, all of the savory courses were overly salty. Don't the chefs taste the creations and/or make sure it's perfection before sending them out? DISAPPOINTING! I couldn't even finish the rabbit consumme, even though it was probably $7/spoonful. And why was there something that resembled a baby walrus tooth hidden in the fried part of my course #9? So, in one sentence, I'm not coming back here, unless you're taking me, and the meal's on you."
179,"mmmmm.... my favorite course: winter in new hampshire (I want to still be eating that snow) balloon (the greatest piece of candy anyone has ever given me) seafood bites (the mussel, razor clam, and crab were the best bites of those items I have ever had) my complaint: i wish I took my time more. they didn't rush me of course. I just wish I slowed down a bit. haha... there are so many amazing things happening. the only solution is to do it again soon... big surprises: an amazing person to walk us through the wine pairings. truly talented. there is nothing else to say that has not been said. I read every blog I could get my hands on before going. i know how well documented this meal is. still... I was in awe the entire time. talented team. thank you. hope to see you again soon, in a different season."
180,"I just wanted to get my five star vote in. Really, I can't add much to the 600+ reviews raving about the place. The food is just incredible, the experience is unforgettable, the service is amazing yet comfortable. This is an experience of a lifetime. And we got to watch Mr. Achatz in action in the kitchen. Super cool."
181,"Believe the hype! I ate here last night and loved it. Best meal of my life? Yup. An amazing sensory overload? Indeed. Over the top? Of course! There isn't much to add to the praise already laid out on this Yelp page. One thing I don't see mentioned a lot is the environment there. While this is a luxurious over-the-top experience, I wouldn't go here for a romantic night out. The focus is all on the food and the wine. So, long gushy conversations get cut-off descriptions and instructions for the next dish or glass of wine. Oh, and as someone who has a pretty minimal knowledge of wine, I sort of wish the sommelier could dumb down his descriptions a bit. I actually mentioned to him that I didn't know a ton about wine, but that didnt't stop the descriptions and wine comments that were way over my head. Highlights - Black Truffle Explosion, monocrhomatic white bass, rabbit rillete, earl grey tea dessert. Now that I have gone once, I am worried I am going to be looking for excuses to head back soonish!"
182,"Disappointment in the food. You will not get the best meal in your recent memory here, not even close. With a couple of exceptions, it was NOT innovative. It wasn't even about fresh ingredients, no not really. Sometimes, it did more to confuse the tastebuds than anything pleasant. It borrowed shamelessly from other cultures, and the outcome paled in comparison or was completely wrong. Seriously, the ignorance. But could the average diner even tell? I could rip into some of the 'bites' in more detail but it's not worth it. The homage to Escoffier was the worst for me - the squab was lukewarm, which is oh so ironic. The stone soup, while a cheeky idea, was medicinal. Not to mention, 3 out of the 4 waiters were just reciting the same descriptions all night. The only thing they had down was the pace of the service. Again, it's another reminder that our culture buys into experiences that ultimately leave us feeling unsatisfied. This was just a big masquerade, no substance. C'mon Grant - who's watching over your kitchen?! Keller said if you can taste the seasoning, then you've overdone it. Well, every other dish was salty. There were also inedible 'artifacts' in two separate courses that we had. Ugh, the lack of attention to detail is insulting."
183,"Went here with a fellow chef for dinner on a cold sunday night in November. When we walked in we were told the table wasn't ready for us yet, the GM then offered us a glass of champagne on the house. When we got to our table the server was wonderful and we looked over the wine menu, the sommlier came over and presented us with a bottle of there finest champagne on the house. When we dined there sure there were a few dishes that were not the best, but hey two dishes out of 20 that were not up to standard were fine by me. After the meal took a tour of the kitchen and noticed some people I knew."
184,I expected naked men fanning me with banana leaves while little people massaged my feet while I was eating this meal. Especially for the cost. But it was amazing all around dining experience that intrigued all my senses. Spectacular service. Fabulous attention to detail. Food was a work of art. Definitely recommend it at least one time in your life.
185,"As soon as I found out my brother & I would be in Chicago in May, our first move was to figure out how to get a table at Alinea. We are both foodies and had watched the restaurant from afar, and we wanted a chance to experience it. We had never spent more than $50 or $60 for a meal, but were willing to pay the price for something like Alinea. We called a couple months in advance and were able to get a prime 8:30pm spot on a Saturday. The restaurant was happy to accommodate our requests for no alcohol or no pork in the dishes, which was a relief. Upon arriving at the restaurant, you'll notice that there's no sign and it's in a fairly unassuming gray building. As you walk in, you are greeted by a small hallway bathed in a red glow. An automatic sliding door opens to your left and you are greeted -- by name -- and taken directly to your table. Despite probably being the youngest people in the restaurant, we were treated well by the large and experienced wait staff, and they made an effort to be approachable. They are definitely trained to add to the drama and overall excitement. We were especially impressed by their focus on service in all aspects of your time there -- including getting you a cab or ensuring your car is waiting for you. Many people have already written about the food and menu, so I do not need to add to that and ruin any surprises or give away the fun. I will, however, echo the sheer fun and brilliance of the restaurant. We tried many ingredients for the first time and most dishes were excellent. Surprisingly, some of the meat, especially the lamb, was cooked less perfectly than expected, but the dishes still impressed. The dessert, crafted by Chef Achatz at the end of our meal, directly on our table, was fun and you could see his intense focus and technique. I would encourage you to go with some excitement and an open mind. It's certainly not cheap, but it's a memorable meal and if you're like me, you'll start scheming to return as soon as you walk out the door."
186,One of the most memorable meals I've ever had. Brilliant and boldly creative food that will keep you and your dinner companions talking of the rest of the evening. I would go back in heartbeat.
187,"My third visit and as good as ever. Highlight courses below but see the blog for full review: -- For the next course we received not only a bowl but also a story and when it was all said and done ""Brook trout reflections of Steve Stallard"" would prove to be the second best dish I have ever had at Alinea. Named as an ode to Chef Achatz's friend who normally provides his whole harvest of Brook Trout roe to Alinea this dish opted to pair the roe with the entirety of the fish - head, spine, tail, fillets, and fins - in a glass bowl along with Michigan maple syrup, pecans, wild puffed rice, nasturtium flowers, and white beans both whole and pureed. Again complicated in a way that very few can achieve with such finesse this was the sort of dish where each bite presented an entirely different experience - some intense and briny while others were creamy and sweet with the best for myself being half of the maple syrup bubble paired with a dollop of roe, a bit of the bean puree, and the crispy fish head in a single spoonful. -- For the pillow course a dish entitled ""Wild Mushrooms, pine, sumac, ramp"" would arrive featuring Matisutake, Maitake, Chanterelle, and Hon Shimeji mushrooms in varying degrees of preparation mixed with pine cream, Sumac Breadcrumbs, pickled ramps, fried shallots, thyme, wild lettuce, and mushroom reduction. Slightly awkward as it always is eating off of a pillow the dish was presented with jokes about one of the servers frequently dumping this plate on guests (""just joking, just joking"") but once the pillow deflated a bit filling the air with the light essence of vaporized pine this course would prove to be my second favorite of the evening, a flawless ""woodsy"" amalgam that trumped even the much raved ""Walk in the Forest"" at Next the following day. -- For the next savory course Chef Achatz would find inspiration in a London housed painting by Miro for a tabletop arrangement appropriately titled ""Squab inspired by Miro."" Beginning first by spraying and polishing the table with black tea this course was presented with nine forks and spoons arranged 'as random as possible' and containing ""Squab, Foie Gras...and the rest is for you to figure out"" as two large vessels spewed forth a light lavender aroma that washed over the table and permeated the air. With no specific instructions on how to eat this save for placing the used utensils in the silver vessels the next six minutes would prove an adventurous blind tasting of squab, foie gras, celery root with pumpernickel, Picholine olive, lavender noodle, duck fat with blis vinegar, yellow plum, and fig - all but the noodle and duck fat being guessed spot on by our trio and all in all a great bit of fun. --- For the final presentation of the evening the silpat would arrive first followed shortly thereafter by two large chocolate colored vessels, a quartet of small bowls, a steaming pot of liquid nitrogen, and finally by Chef Achatz with apron surprisingly stained and face appearing slightly sullen and stern without speaking a word (a trend we noted with each of the other tabletop presentations in the room as well.) Beginning first by placing the two vessels at the center of the table and filling each with an ample amount of liquid nitrogen Chef Achatz next proceeded to drizzle the table with reductions of Lingonberry Syrup, Citrus and butternut squash reduction, and Goose Island Caramel Stout before dusting the entirety of the table with edible citrus marigold flowers and subsequently lifting each of the vessels and dropping them to the table where they shattered releasing contents that can best be described as the result of breaking open a child's Halloween basket or perhaps a piata. With chocolate notes predominating some bites while flavors of the squash, berries, and stout punctuated others this enormous dessert went slowly - easily over the course of twenty to thirty minutes as we playfully explored its contents; everything from cotton candy and fruit roll-ups to cookies and candies such as house made twizzlers and corn nuts. With bites of brioche, balls of butterscotch, and crumbles tasting both like gingerbread and kettle corn rounding out the experience all I can say is that was a dessert as well suited for a child's dream as it was for fine dining and as we finished the final spoonfuls our server stopped by with a look of surprise stating ""wow, I don't think I've ever seen anyone clean the table quite so well."" --"
188,"An amazing culinary experience that I won't forget. Every course was detailed and crafted and served on special made dinner ware. Each wine was well paired to enhance it's accompanying course. The staff was friendly and fun and not stuffy at all. They would even joke around with us as we kidded about the night. The savory courses were all so good and I wish they had more of the savory and less of the sweet courses. As the night drew on I was eagerly awaiting the final dessert course because I had read how Chef Achatz comes out to create it using the entire table. Watching him was like watching a cross between artist and a lab scientist. I had only wish that Achatz would have been a bit more conversational with our table but I'm sure he has much to do and many other tables to deal with. As we devoured the amazing dessert in record time, we asked the staff that if anybody had ever licked the table clean. They said some people have come pretty close to it. We did get allowed to tour the kitchen at the end of dinner and it was much smaller than I thought and filled with 20+ cooks all in a well coordinated production line style of cooking. Despite the final cost of it all, I'm glad I did it."
189,"This was an absolutely wonderful dining experience. I was expecting it to be as well considering the awards, reviews, and price. I enjoyed each course. They were each complex and creative. The taste and smell of each made me want to take notes as I had them b/c there were so many that it was easy to forget. Fortunately, they give you a lovely print-out of the menu for that evening...which is a nice keep-sake. I did not partake in the wine pairings. I believe it is 10 tastings of different wines. From previous reviews, I thought it best to just order a bottle of wine which I was very pleased with. To top off a wonderful dinner, Grant Achatz was in the house and came to present dessert. It just made the entire night even better. And, oh my goodness, that dessert was SO unbelievably delicious! Oh, and get coffee...the best ever. The service is outstanding although there were a few times when they were a bit antsy and tried to clear my dish before I finished. I'm a talker, what can I say? :) Also, my reservation was at 5:30 so the restaurant is just beginning their service which makes the servers almost too attentive. At my table, I faced the openness of the room which allowed me to take note of everything that was happening....enjoyable b/c I was able to see the process but also a little annoying b/c I could see them hawking my table trying to gauge when to come over. So, my advice is to sit facing a wall if that will make you uncomfortable. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to go back!"
190,"This is a continuation of my review of Alinea... 18. Squab in different preparations - sous vide & rillettes, served with strawberry dramatically on a birch log. Tender, packed with flavour, moist, highlight of the mains though course 21 did run it close 19. Black truffle explosion. A Grant Achatz signature dish where the ravioli served holds a flavour bomb of truffle emulsion and is served with romaine and parmesan . If anything is going to explode in your mouth, make sure it tastes as good as this does 20. Palate cleanser of hibiscus tonic 21. Escoffier's beef. Wagyu beef cooked sous vide, then seared. Isn't your mouth already watering just by reading those words? Well, it ate as well as it sounded 22. Lemon soda powder to be consumed in one bite. Conjures childhood memories 23. Raspberry transparency served with yoghurt. How do they make these films so fine and yet packed with flavour? 24. Bubble gum. A long clear cigar sized tube holding hibiscus & creme fraiche tapioca pearls. Fun dish as you had to suck out the contents from the tube 25. Lemon & pine but with caramelised white chocolate served on a plate placed on a pillow filled with Earl grey tea smoke. The plate gradually deflates the balloon as you eat and the scent enhances the food After course 25, the servers cleared my table. But wait, the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that I hadn't had my 26th course. Well, this is where the magic really happened. Big spoiler ahead for those of you intending to eat the Tour menu, so if you prefer surprises, please skip to the last paragraph! Well, the servers relaid my table with a waterproof cloth and arranged different ramekins on the tabletop. If you've read my previous reviews, you'll know that I like my kitchen tours if I eat at a fine dining restaurant and chef is in service. I was starting to wonder if I should request my kitchen visit, looked down at my mobile phone and looked back up to see Grant Achatz standing at my table!!!!!!! I think my jaw hit the floor. Then, he said that he was going to create my last dessert course himself on my table. In what seemed no time at all, he used different forms of chocolate, coconut, menthol and hyssop to draw on the tabletop - precise drops of gradually decreasing size, smears, streaks, all of which were edible He then told me to come down to the kitchen after my meal where I could take pictures. To this day, I'm still amazed that Grant Achatz cooked at my table. That will stay with me to the end of my dining days Chef Achatz took time to show me round the kitchen and I had my picture taken with him. He is truly a friendly and humble guy Alinea truly is the pinnacle of my dining experiences. The food is innovative & playful but still packs a flavour punch. The whole evening is an unforgettable experience from beginning to end I'm also indebted to my Yelp friend Tess M for forwarding me this inspirational article from the New Yorker about Grant Achatz, which emphasises the amazing journey he has taken to get Alinea to that pinnacle: http://www.newyorker.com"
191,Best meal that I've ever had. Went for our anniversary and still talk about it years later!
192,"I am loved. I am loved and I can't say thanks enough. How do I know? Two clients took me to dinner here. Tonight. December 12th, 2009. When did they start planning this? March. Is this about me? No. If it had been, it would have ended already. This is about this amazing place called Alinea. One of my top four places in Chicago that I have been meaning to venture to. To experience. And well, it left me speechless. We went with the ""Chef's tasting"" which is the thirteen course and then opted for the fourteenth course which was the choice of risotto or pasta with white truffle shaved over it. And of course wine pairings. (if this is how I feel after fourteen, lord knows I would be flat on my face for twenty four). The service impeccable. You feel like a rock star, with out the stuffiness of the situation. Going to the bathroom? Servers clear a path for you. Ego stroking at its best. Returning, the chair or table pulled out, a fresh napkin put out and you better have your best eager game face on, because what they put out in front of you may just slap a smile on your face. Not to go through each course, but really by then end I was topped by one new course by new course, by new amazement, by new amazement, by triumph by new highly achieved triumph. Fuck. Yeah. At first a slightly poached quail egg bursting in your mouth with shitake mushrooms with smoked trout and smoked trout roe was enough to blow your mind, then shortly after arrives a juniper mix of greens smoking and wafting up energy and aroma to make you relax and invigorate your senses. Oh what ho!? A tempura fried collection of goose and cranberry among others among those juniper mix? Seriously. Stop. You can't get better... oh wait. That extra course of white truffle and your choice of pasta or risotto. Yeah... risotto won and so did the truffle. Melt in your mouth sinful amazement. Don't stop. Get it. Get it. Every course so well paired. The attention to detail. The attention to care. The attention to having fun. Every server we had was amazing. Well informed and friendly and over the top fun. Will I stop back? Hell yeah. Oh hell yeah."
193,"I'm not sure where to start with Alinea, honestly. My boyfriend randomly took me here for a late-night dinner the night before I left for a weekend trip without him. I knew all about Alinea. I knew I was tired after a long day. I knew it was a terribly rainy night and I looked horrible. I also knew how much of his paycheck would go into the meal. Needless to say, I was pretty angry at his extravagance (though I knew he did it all in love), and I was not at all in the mood for a fancy shmancy dinner like this. So dinner definitely started off on the wrong foot. Luckily, by the time course 6 came around, I had gotten over myself and I started to feel like a kid in toy heaven. Actually, I felt like a judge on Food Network's Iron Chef and I was LOVING it. The bf, though, was scarfing every morsel down as if his life depended on it. That kind of made me sad, but I didn't let it get to me too much and I proceeded to smell, observe, and savor every course with absolute delight. And some of those courses were seriously unique and amazing. Like super wow. And our servers were sooo kind, so professional, and so hospitable. After 4 hours (a little past 1 a.m.) and 22 courses later, I was completely full and content and ready for our final dessert course of the evening. Let's just say that this dessert course was extra special. Because it came with an engagement ring. Haha. Who woulda thunk it? What started out as the most imperfect night ended in the most perfect way. :) In summary, Alinea will forever remain close to my stomach and heart."
194,"Service: 5 Presentation: 5 Decor: 3 Taste and Flavor: - 5 or Negative 5 ----------------------------------------- Simply put worst food any of us ever ate. Yes I am not a food expert but I trust my taste-buds and no they are not happy at all after eating at Alinea. All of us hated it. Great service and presentation but zero in taste, flavor and satisfaction. None of us will ever eat this stupid food (not sure if I even want to call it food) again, even if we are paid to eat it. I drank like 6 - 7 glasses of water/beverage to shove it down, thinking after every course that may be next would be better or may be just the final dessert would be better but no it also was tasteless, bitter. After tolerating the first 7 or 8 courses we started fearing what may come next and Alinea kept on delivering bad tasting dishes one after another. Most dishes were extremely salty and tasted like I am eating some pain relieving cream like Bengay. When the chef came to our table to put together the dessert he didn't look happy or excited at all but rather looked angry and not-interested. I guess that was planned to convey some kind of experience of shock or something when he just dropped the big ball of chocolate and frozen ice cream on our table and just walked away without saying anything, but I didn't like it one bit and rather felt it was stupid and rude. I would rather like the usual when the chef laughs and asks how was the food. Please save your hard earned money. Sandwich from my neighborhood Potbelly is better than this. If you really have money to burn then you are better off by simply donating that money or may be book a flight to see beautiful San Francisco and make a reservation to eat some real good food at ""Gary Danko"" instead of this junk. So much disappointed that we cancelled all of the next reservations, for second group of friends to follow after a few days. I fully understand and highly appreciate the amount of effort and dedication that goes in producing such a complex meal. Yes this is a new kind of experience and all, but still I want to have an experience where I at least like the taste of the food but unfortunately there is nothing here that I can say good about. Experiences like this make me wish I could give negative stars."
195,"I went to Alinea to celebrate?? my 34th birthday with my mom in May 2008. Everything started out great and ended quite badly for me. So my birthday was kind of ruined. Want to know why? Please read on.... I am giving Alinea five stars because this was a dining experience like none other delivered by a staff that if they put their mind to it could save the world from every single challenge this globe is facing. The restaurant is impossible to find from the outside as its entrance is intentionally hidden at the end of a rabbit hole like cave in a typical building like every other on the street. Be on time, this is like showing up to a theater, you have to be at your table at the time of the reservation. Dress appropriately: Men should wear a shirt and a jacket, women should dress up like they're going out. Jeans are probably not a good idea. This is a formal affair, dress like a formal affair. On the other hand, as a proponent of casual clothes and being comfortable while you eat, I would like to recommend that you not overdo it with ties and uncomfortable getups. Be comfortable but sharp looking and you will do fine. Once inside, you're seated at your own table, briefed about the meal ahead, asked about your preferences in terms of refreshments, offered the wine matching option. The restaurant is softly lit, and relatively quiet. Watch out if you have a big voice like I do -- you will have to remind yourself to talk softly. Before making a reservation at this restaurant, please check their website first to see if the ingredients in the individual courses agree with your dietary restrictions. I have seafood allergies, specifically shellfish. If you inform Alinea ahead of time they will make accommodations for you in the course line up. There are two options 12 course meal and 24 course meal. We made the mistake of being over-enthusiastic and picking the 24 course meal with wine pairings. Every piece that was presented to us was unique, delicious, and a work of art in itself. I am sure every other reviewer has attempted to describe the line up and such. I won't go into all that detail here. I HIGHLY recommend first timers to get the 12 course meal. You think you can do the 24 but you're wrong and you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. It's not the quantity of the food that's the problem, it's the number of ingredients. By the time we hit #18, neither my mother nor I wanted to see food ever again for the rest of our lives because the number of ingredients in our tummies was probably about in the hundreds. Take that and mix it with the 12 wines we had tasted by that point and you have yourself one hell of an upset tummy. I literally turned green after #16 which I think was the lobster -- which I have not reacted to before although it is shellfish. So I had a small tiny piece of it. I got very ill in a very short period of time but I assumed it was a temporary thing and that it would pass. I was not about to lose my dinner or anything. But the feeling of something horrible is about to happen never passed. When we hit course #18, I called the wait staff and told them to stop bringing us more food and bring us the bill. They were super nice and courteous about our early departure by the way which made me feel even worse than I was feeling for leaving. We got the check; Alinea was super nice to us with the check, they discounted the courses we did not have, and the wine we did not drink. This was a class act. I was ready to pay the full amount and leave as soon as possible. Needless to say I barely made it to my room at our hotel to find my insides boiling up and refusing to stay in me. I hate to say it but I lost all 300 dollars worth of exotic spices, meats, foliage, vegetables, and beautiful design down the toilet in less than 15 minutes. I was sick for the rest of the night and it kind of ruined my birthday. After this incident things did not taste right for two weeks. Everything tasted salty to me. To this day the smell of peanut paste ( a flavoring that was omni present in almost every we ate at Alinea) makes me throw up a little in my mouth. Ok I kid about that part. :-) Am I complaining about Alinea? No, not one bit. These were a bunch of beautiful, talented, hard working individuals that put on a feast and show for all senses. I think this restaurant helped me realize my dislike for multi course meals and fusion cuisine. So the problem is with me, not with Alinea. Let me story be a cautionary tale. If you have not done this before, proceed with caution, get the tasting menu -- 12 courses and not the grand tour -- 24 courses. Do not get the wine pairings unless you're an experienced wine connoisseur -- as it adds up in terms of volume fast and you end up mixing champagne, white wine and several red wines -- a recipe for disaster for someone like me -- a light light drinker."
196,"I really struggled rating Alinea. I feel like I have to give it a high score because, well, it's Alinea. But in reality, it most definitely was not my favorite dining experience I have ever had, and for what you pay, I expected to be blown away -which I was not.... With that being said, it still was a wonderful meal - the service is unbeatable. They do their very best to make you understand what you are eating and drinking - and the servers are not stuffy at all which was unexpected. They space out the reservations, so the people next to you are never at the same course which keeps things from feeling like a factory. There is absolutely no music or noise to block out other conversations or the server speaking to other tables, so that was the one bad thing about the overall mood and element of surprise. Overall, there were some really good courses and some not so good courses. I was very displeased starting the whole experience with 3 small shots of alcohol because I specifically didn't eat much that day in preparation for our big meal, and drinking on an empty stomach almost made me throw up! I have no idea why they wouldn't have the alcohol a few courses in... Everything was prepared beautifully and was made with purpose, but I was not blown away by a single course - which I expected that I would. When my husband and I left, we both thought the experience was cool, however I don't know if it was worth the money. After the food and wine pairing, I could have paid for 4 or 5 meals at a restaurant that I have given 5's (Roy's or Sunda..). I would not go again, nor would I urge any friends to go either. If you do go, however, definitely do the wine pairing. They tell you it is about 1/3 the cost of dinner (NOT TRUE) but they really do pair nicely with the meal."
197,"So... I've come to see that I am the minority in my less than stellar review of Alinea. I shall then assume that it's me. I am both too immature and not cool enough to appreciate this restaurant. Must admit the atmosphere is pretty interesting. There are sliding doors, no windows, uber modern. But then again, so is a spaceship. But really - people actually like the food? Really? I guess my palate isn't sophisticated enough or personally not pretentious enough. ""Heaven"", ""best dining experience ever"", ""touches every sense and beyond"",""gustatory hedonism"", ""food orgasm"", like other reviews claim? Wow. Personally, a fried mozzarella stick has gotten me closer to climax than anything at this place. But again, it's just me. I gave it two stars because the caramel dessert was rather cool - it's solid and becomes liquid in your mouth. Guess that's my sexual innuendo in this review."
198,"If Thomas Keller were to hatch an edible Faberge egg in Chicago he would christen it Alinea. Yet it would be encased in the most delicate membrane. Suspended in a shot glass. And upon swallowing, it would explode into the most delightful, surprising and refreshing sensations. Like Mr. Keller's cuisine, there is play in the food at Alinea. The simply named Caramel Corn, a shot glass of liquefied popcorn with caramel foam, reminded me of the joy and delight of being presented with equally nostalgic Salmon cornettes with creme fraiche at The French Laundry -- salmon, creme fraiche & chives presented like mini ice cream cones; the beads in Alinea's White Truffle, Toasted Oat Milk, Pink Pepper and Pear texturally & playfully remniscent of Mr. Keller's Oysters & Pearls. Each presentation at Alinea is unique and exercises all of your flavor senses: *whisper-thin bacon finished with ribbons of butterscotch and apple and dots of thyme dangling effortlessly from a suspended wire atop arc; *a plate of beans with many garnishes resting atop a pillow of scented nutmeg air, the air diffused while you are eating; *one bite of pumpkin, brown sugar and tempura pierced atop a burning cinnamon stick, the scent of cinnamon inhaled while consuming; *a pin of wagyu beef hidden beneath a cloak of aromatic cedar branches; *persimmon presented in two puddles, with the tiniest greens and earthy texture evoking painstaking simplicity yet with the most refined and well thought flavor and texture combinations. But to be enjoyed by first placing a thin, clear cellophane-like aroma strip on your tongue and deliciously warming it in your mouth. To name only 5 of 24 courses. Check out the pics: http://www.yelp.com/biz_ I still marvel that Chef / Owner Grant Achatz is able to create such unique and avant garde food and ways of eating. No surprise either that he is doing this in Chicago, a living incubation of progress + art + architecture + function + whimsy to the scent of Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, the champagne top of the Carbide & Carbon building, the truly spectacular Tiffany stained-glass dome at the Chicago Cultural Center, the outdoor installations at Millenium Park, the ever-present Chicago bridges. And on and on. Chicago is inspiring, even in below 20s snowy winter. After eating at Alinea, I couldn't help but smile at the commonplace cedar branches covering the potted plants lining Michigan Avenue. And wonder: whether Mr. Achatz would consider an inventive, unique snow inspired plate?"
199,"Oh Alinea.... My Boyfriend Adored eating here, and it was an experience of course. I particularly loved the hot and cold potato soup.... And the presentation of the food which was gorgeous. But what ruined this what-should-have-been-immaculate meal for me was the attitude and proximity of the staff. From the get go a waiter who presented us with a wine list turned up his nose and nastily said, ""No!"" when I asked if they had any wine from South America. (I adore Chilean and to a degree Argentinean wine). The table next to us then inquired why they did not carry it, which set him off on a diatribe on how it is lesser wine, cheap, not well-developed, etc. Apparently not only is the customer not always-right, her taste in wine should be criticized openly to the whole room. Whereas some restaurants, not having the wine you like, will gladly offer to go pick it up for you, Alinea rather slapped us in the face. That already left a bad taste in my mouth, which was agitated all night by the fact the gaggle of awkward waiters stood maybe 5 feet from our table against a dresser continually eyeing us as we ate. There is a not-so-fine line between attentive and obnoxious service. The waiters at Tru know when you need your wine refilled or are ready for your next course - they don't hover near you giggling and telling hushed stories to each other like a couple of high schoolers. Maybe they should be sent over to Tru for a lesson in waiter and sommelier etiquette. Yes, I should have said something to the manager at the beginning of the night, or at least when I realized the situation would not improve. My boyfriend loved the interesting food and textures at Alinea. I hated the vibe I felt the entire time I was there. He wants to go back some day. We might. I hesitate. And am truly disappointed."
200,"The virtues of this restaurant have already been exalted ad nauseum. I would like to add that the food, plating, and service at Alinea strives to be more whimsical and interactive than at other high caliber restaurants. For example, you have to assemble a scaffold for holding a cabbage leaf. Then you form the cabbage into a roll after adding miniaturized stew, veggies, and sauces--the chef's interpretation of Hungarian Goulash. While very few people would ever crave the food here, the cuisine is nothing if not cutting edge. The whole meal, all three plus hours of it, is quite the production. On another positive note, the servers have personality and make jokes, a charming departure from the flat affects and zombie-like service you'll encounter at other places."
201,"Saturday the 15th finally rolled around and my long anticipated night at Alinea was just hours away. I'd have to go back to December 24th 1984 to recall the last time I felt so anxious. With a nice lunch at Irazu I was primed and ready to go. I even planned which ""jacket"" I was going to wear for the occasion. Jeff, John, and I were about to embark on a five plus hour twenty four course culinary adventure. We were ready. We arrived at Alinea for our 6:30 reservation and were escorted up the glass staircase to our table on the second level. The room we were sat in housed two four tops and a six top. We were a bit nervous that we'd overpower the small room with loud obnoxious vulgarity. Shortly after sitting we realized that they sat us in the loud obnoxious vulgar section. Perfect! Each of us went with the twenty four course ""Tour"" menu with wine pairings. Alinea offers both a twelve and twenty four course menu. (Alinea is so well designed and deliberate that I am actually spelling out 12 and 24 because I think it looks better!) Below you will find a list of each dish we had followed by a few brief descriptions of those dishes that really stood out. In the interest of time I decided to not list the wine pairings, but they were all superb. STEELHEAD ROE coconut, lime, vanilla fragrance Yum! YUBA shrimp, miso, togarashi Deep fried soy milk? Grant Achatz has definitely proven that anything deep fried is bound to be good. CRAB passion fruit, avocado, heart of palm This dish was served as a one biter on a white porcelain spoon. The description delivered by our server listed what seemed to be more than ten ingredients. I asked ""How can you fit all that shit on that little spoon?"" Sure enough all the components were abundantly clear on the pallet from just that one itsy bitsy bite. Delicious! SALSIFY caper, dill, smoked salmon Is it just me or is everybody using Salsify these days? Up until a few weeks ago I had no clue what it was and no I can't get away from it. BEANS many garnishes, pillow of nutmeg air We all selected this dish as the best of the evening. It was a navy bean puree with a piece of crisp pancetta on top of that and on top of that a Guinness beer foam. It was St. Patrick's Day after all! Surrounding the puree was eight or so single bite accompaniments intended to be consumed with the puree. Brilliant! DUCK butternut squash, banana, Thai flavors LAMB mushroom, red wine, diverse embellishments HOT POTATO cold potato, black truffle, butter PORK BELLY smoked paprika, polenta, pickled vegetables CHICKEN SKIN truffle, corn, thyme MANGO soy, foie gras CARAMEL CORN ""liquefied"". Yep, tastes exactly like liquid caramel corn! CRANBERRY frozen and chewy, bitter orange, chervil One of the most simple and interesting dishes of the evening! WAGYU BEEF black truffle, potato, Blis Elixir They dangle this piece of beef in front of you and don't let it eat it! It just sits there taunting you and finally they serve it atop a hot potato. ICE FISH shellfish, horseradish, parsley APPLE CIDER walnut milk, cinnamon, vegetable ash SWEETBREAD cauliflower, burnt bread, toasted hay BLACK TRUFFLE explosion, romaine, parmesan A signature dish that should never ever be taken off of the menu. Easily my second favorite dish of the evening. Rich and delicious! Hands down the best pierogi I have ever had! TRANSPARENCY of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt BACON butterscotch, apple, thyme PERSIMMON carrot, red curry, spice strip LICORICE CAKE muscovado, sugar, orange, hyssop CHOCOLATE egg, pomelo, smoke SWEET POTATO bourbon, tempura, cinnamon incense COFFEE five ways The space is stunning. It looks like it was pulled from the pages of a really strong issue of Metropolitan Home. To tell you the truth, I was in love with the restaurant before taking a single bite. Alinea....you had me at hello.... You had me at hello.... A majority of the plates and apparatuses that were used for serving food were custom designed for Alinea. The food, the wine, the interior design, the service, and even the china all worked to create a truly harmonious dining experience. It was culinary theatre at its very best. The staff was welled dressed, mostly well behaved (a good thing), and very knowledgeable. Everybody is clad in Zegna so it's hard to look bad! I couldn't keep count of the number of servers who we interacted with, but despite the turnover the service remained consistently perfect. The thing that stuck out the most was how approachable our sommelier was. I enjoy wine and like to have an open dialogue with my sommeliers. I find more often than not the sommeliers try to prove their worth to you by spewing out obscure facts and using bad accents. Our guy was just like one of the guys. Well, one of the guys who knows a whole lot about wine. 3 ""Tour"" Menus with Wine Pairings $1300"
202,"I have been to Alinea five times since the place has opened.. Last night being my latest time.. I think the last time I went was about two years ago in July.. I was surprised to have had repeats of dishes I have had.. The hot potato cold potato and the black truffle explosion. Though they were good, I was hoping to have come back two years later and seen a lot of progress.. Service still impeccable, room still elegant and understated... I just remember previous dinners being a lot more over the top.. A lot more playful, perhaps even more scientific. They also have a new format which is only 19 courses.. I think I normally got 25 or 30 courses.. Things like frozen foie gras huckelberry soup stands out as being one of the best things I have eaten there, was I think 3 years ago.. Anyway, all I am saying is, I think the world may be catching up with Grant, perhaps some of the shock is gone but, what remains is still wonderful flavor combination and beautifully prepared dishes. The best dish I had last night was a recreation of a class Escoffier dish.. A perfectly made butter tart with a slice of squab breast and some forced squab meat and foie gras ovals. Beautifully done dish. The way he was able to take a classic dish and add a little modern twist but, keep it's integrity, it was amazing.. A monochramtic dish consisted of 6 components all stark white.. Really enjoyed the idea behind this dish but, the flavors escape me.. I have had something similar to this dish made by Pierre Gagniere a few years back.. Still it takes such skill and creativity to pull this dish off. Flavor combinations like combinig appricot with thai basil, absolutely beautiful.. Adding a dot of black liquorice to a dish which created a strong curry taste.. Also a revelation.. I guess that bar has been set so high by him that it might be impossible to top.. A wonderful experience non the less.. I will certainly be back next year."
203,"I'm a nerd. For a long time, I denied that. I'm good at math. I like to play computer games. I'd rather watch Discovery Channel over the Playboy Channel (assuming my hijacked SPICE network is on the fritz). Whatever the case, I've embraced my inner-nerd and celebrate it (with close friends only). For these reasons, I suppose that I would have a natural interest and affinity towards molecular gastronomy. Ground-breaking chefs such as Ferran Adria and Pierre Gagnaire push the limits of food and really make us reconsider everything we know about cuisine. Well friends, after dining at Alinea, I believe Grant Achatz deserves to be listed with the heavy-hitters of molecular gastronomy. Now let me remind you all that wifey and I are not toothless hillbillies who are easily fooled with smoke and mirrors. If something tastes bad, we'll say it tastes bad no matter how much you manipulate or dress it up. We've eaten at places that try to wow their customers with ridiculous foams, lavender perfumes, and lobster-scented bubble-baths... we weren't fooled. Molecular gastronomy is a powerful tool. But when it's done poorly, everything on your plate just seems pathetically silly. Options at Alinea are simple, choose the tasting or the tour menu. If you want to do the tour menu, you'll have to commit when you make the reservation (typically 2 months in advance). You'd better go with the tour, or you're an idiot. Brief version: 22 courses, nearly 5 hours. - At least 4 courses involved liquid nitrogen. - 2 courses involved warnings by our server of possible ""explosion"". - 3 courses included custom-made utensils which could poke your eye out... - 4 courses included live plants Long version: Wifey and I are fairly quick eaters. If food is set in front of us, we'll gleefully shove it in our gullets and chew later. The pace at Alinea was very good, with stuff coming out pretty quickly. Despite this, nearly five hours lapsed from beginning to end. I felt like we were in some time-warp because the dinner seemed to pass by so quickly. Another benefit of molecular gastronomy!! The showmanship and creativity were truly breathtaking. Many courses were highlighted by unique bowls, plates, and utensils created especially for that particular dish. Other offerings were accented simply with embellishments by mother nature herself. A branch of oak leaves, a single hyacinth stalk, a fat gob of brook trout roe... mmmmm brook trout roe. If you can set aside the snake-oil and smoke, the food is absolutely astounding. Because many courses consist of a single bite, swallow, or ""explosion"", the flavors have to be concentrated and ""spot-on"" or the entire course is a waste of time. In these single morsels, Chef Achatz's genius is revealed. That liquid nitrogen or burnt bread reduction isn't puffery, it's methodically and painstakingly utilized to make the food better. Better food through science... Alinea would give Vulcans orgasms. You'd better believe that our Chicago experience was highlighted by our dinner at Alinea. It beats deep-dish pizza by a country mile!"
204,"This absolutely has to have been the best restaurant experience that I have had in recent history. While I was a little apprehensive having gone to another ""tastings"" restaurant a couple of weeks before and being underwhelmed, this was all and more that it was touted to be. From the time I walked into the door, everything was perfect. Someone whisked my coat away before I even knew it- no ticket for the coat- yet somehow I knew they would find it when I was ready for it. After being seated in the front room done in shades of gray and purple, we were reminded of the tasting that we chose (12 courses) and were asked if we wanted the basic wine pairings or the more obscure wine pairings. We chose the basic (additional $95 per person) and were not disappointed. There was an Italian Cabanon Bonarda that was absolutely my favorite wine of the night. We started with cold potato soup with a black truffle served like an oyster in a shell and were told to eat it in just that way. The food was not only delicious, but I couldn't help wondering with each course how to eat it- challenging myself with options to see if I could come up with how they would suggest the ultimate enjoyment. One of my favorite presentations was a pillow (yes, I said pillow) that was placed at each setting on the table that was filled with ""juniper air"". The smell was amazing and perfectly complimented the duck that was served on it. Or imagine small cubes of lamb on a hot stone with a sprig of fresh rosemary inserted into that stone. The aromatic scent that was released from the rosemary perfectly complimented the lamb which was served 3 different ways. Throughout the night, while we had a multitude of servers, all were well informed about each course and answered any questions that we had. It was great service without any pretense. They do encourage men to wear jackets, however, only one of the men I was with had a jacket and the others were not made to feel uncomfortable- keep in mind this was on a Wednesday night- weekends might be different. If you are looking for a really special night out- this has to be it. It's not a ""cheap date"" - we spent $1200 for 4 of us, but it was worth every penny. I will definitely be back to see what other surprises this amazing chef dreams up."
205,"I admit, I'm a sick, twisted person who went out of my way to find fault with Alinea. Impossible. Yes, could have spent the money on a year's worth of groceries, but am perfectly content with the decision to blow it on 24 courses here. It's a 3 hour plus experience of impeccable, impossible-to-replicate flavors and service, all worthy of the hype. Dishes served on aromatic lavender pillows that deflate with each bite. Nuclear butter balls the size of pennies that erupt with a puncture, perfectly saturating nearby lobster. Explosions of black truffle, which, if you ignore the instructions of eating with your mouth closed, have superhero potential to careen out of your mouth at high speeds and decapitate others. And bacon, bubble gum, wagyu, foie gras, bass, and much much more taken to sublime levels of culinary genius and creative mastery. Did the wine pairing, which was also a gift for the birthday boy. Our goal was to be wildly drunk when the bill came. Sadly, 24 courses have the uncanny power to absorb endless wine, so this did not happen. Next time, may need to bring a flask for this sole purpose. A bedazzled one of course, to match the classy ambiance. You should know that hours later, I woke up violently ill. Though I was tempted to blame courses 3, 7, 13 and 19 in order to get a partial refund, the more appropriate culprit is likely my kitchen floor. In preparation for the feast, I'm not ashamed to say I starved myself to the point where I was licking it in order to accomplish the dual task of mildly quenching my hunger, while also buffing it to a healthy shine."
206,"I had a very nice time here. The food was tasty, surprising and interesting. The staff were friendly and incredibly attentive. Here are the reasons it's not getting an extra star: -My mind was not blown. Maybe molecular gastronomy isn't for me. The food was like nothing I've ever eaten, but it did not connect with me the way I'd hoped. In addition to tasting flavors combined in new and interesting ways, I would have like to experience familiar flavor combinations done better. -Some of the dishes were too salty for my taste (the rabbit consomme, black truffle explosion). That's strange, because I like salt."
207,"Alinea was simply phenomenal. And SO FUN! Walking in the entrance, you knew you were getting into an experience to say the least. The dining room was cozy and warm, like dining in a fancy friend's house. The service was perfect - professional but not too stiff. They were good at reading our table and as the night progressed, and even became friendly - cracked a smooth joke here and there, and answered the questions that we rhetorically asked ourselves. Also, contributed to our skydiving conversations. The food was out of this world. Each course had a story and contributed to the entire journey. The wine pairings were perfect as well."
208,"Warning: The following review is TRUNCATED and better revisited at my blog for full pictures and commentary =P Five stars for innovation, though some flavors are less accessible to the palate than others Alinea can best be described as a series of carefully orchestrated surprises for each of your five senses. While the 12-course tasting menu will set you back $135 and a good four hours, it is unlike any culinary experience I've had yet. It may seem counterintuitive, but the best way to experience Alinea is without expectations. Yes, you've read the hype and you've heard the buzz about molecular gastronomy--but you've never had bacon for a palate cleanser and you've never dreamed of adding soy sauce to your dessert. So when you hear adjectives such as good, orgasmic, or weird, you're really only hearing expletives that are void of meaning. Because unless you've been intimately acquainted with the likes of Homaro Cantu, Heston Blumenthal, Wylie Dufresne, or Ferran Adria, you will really have no baseline with which to compare Alinea to. COURSE HiGHLIGHTS Course 3: Monkfish - banana, onion, lime // Cauliflower. Our only other seafood dish was Monkfish (vegetarian Cauliflower), prepared in a mousse, tempura, and steamed with banana and lime sauces and garnished with an onion paper. Above all, this was a lesson in texture with the creamy mousse, crunchy tempura, and silky monkfish. The banana and lime sauces cooled the dish, while the onion paper dissolved swiftly in our mouths. Like any good lover, Achatz means only to give you a taste of what he's got in store for the rest of night. Our first four courses were merely child's play--dishes that were fathomable and gently teased us into oral foreplay. So just when we were starting to get bored... Course 5: Apple - horseradish, celery. We were told to throw back the shots and to open our mouths wide to take in the entire ball at once. Once inside, there was a cytoplasmic explosion of apple juice. It was strangely pleasant and slightly erotic all at once. Paying careful attention to the progression, this first eruption was gentle, easing us into the experience. Once the liquid went down, we were left with the essence of horseradish but with only a hint of its heat. The remainder of our savory courses paid homage to the regional cuisine with a Midwest-lean towards rich, protein heavy dishes. Course 6: Duck - mango, yogurt, pillow of lavender air // Turnip. The Duck (vegetarian Turnips) was prepared in a manner befitting of pork with duck rinds, duck bacon, and pulled duck. As with the other fruit sauces, the essence of mango really shone through and for added pizazz, the whole plate was set atop a pillow of lavender air, which diffused directly into our olfactory systems. Course 8: Black Truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan. Though it came sans meat, the Black Truffle ravioli was no less rich. Although benign looking, the pasta membrane actually housed a robust, truffle scented broth that exploded upon contact. The single ravioli captured the soul of an entire pasta dish and would have sated any craving for Italian, no matter how small or large. Course 10: Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme. Our prayers were answered when an interlude came announcing the arrival of dessert. While the vegetarians got a Honeydew jelly to cleanse their palates, we were served dehydrated Bacon. With the OC Fair currently in tow, it was a stone's throw away from a caramel apple. Served on a rocking apparatus, it was highly whimsical and an inventive way to bridge the salty to sweet transition. Our last and final dish was Course 14: Caramel - meyer lemon, cinnamon perfume. I will never understand how you tempura a viscous caramel and lemon, but the taste of churro sent me yearning for home. How many licks do you think it take to get to a center of a caramel tempura ball the size of a golf-ball? Alinea's answer is one. The staff read our minds (or eavesdropped on our conversation) and asked us if we wanted to see the kitchen at the stroke of midnight when our meal ended. The kitchen was starting to wind down, which gave Chef Chad a chance to explain to us the wax molds he was working on. No sign of Grant Achatz, but Chad was good enough eye candy for me. In closing, Alinea is not about what you do or don't like. It is about the appreciation of an unnamed sensation, a flavor that leaves you at a loss for words, and a culinary innovation that is only beginning to take flight in the United States. It is the technology of the early adopter and the beta version of a cuisine that is not yet commercially viable. Some art forms are more accessible to the intellect--others, just need to be studied to be appreciated. Alinea 100 - Introduction to Molecular Gastronomy, check."
209,"Most elegant, sophisticated, art-sy, and quite delicious meal of my life. Well worth the greater $500 price tag. We had the 11 plate tasting with the red-wine pairings only. A year later I can still remember every dish clearly. Highlights were the entire tomato garden brought to the table. Hot Potato Cold Potato!!! A super elegant French duck & truffle dish with the most amazing place setting and wine glass. Just one of the most memorable and beautiful nights of my life. Entirely focused on the wonder of the food in front of me."
210,"I'll start by saying that the food here really is unimpeachable. Every dish was surprising and inventive and technically difficult and beautiful and, on top of all that, delicious. The lowest points were merely very good, and the highest among the best few dishes I've ever had. It even winds up seeming like good value for money -- the night we were there the kitchen, which is open to the right of the entrance, was teeming with probably as many chefs as there were patrons in the restaurant. Swarms of them, bustling in relative order through the huge, open kitchen that looked surgically spare and clean. You're getting amazing food, it's obviously very labor intensive and difficult to prepare, and so you have to pay for the staff to make that happen. So why only three stars? This was the best overall food experience I've ever had, after all. The wait staff. Normally I don't discount stars for the staff, because it's the food that counts, but when you're paying THIS much money, it's important that nothing detract from the dining experience. You should feel comfortable and welcome and taken well care of. We were in an upper dining room with only three other tables active, and about 4 or 5 young men -- early 20s -- working the room, and they seemed to think that whenever they weren't actively doing something for a diner, no eyes were on them. Giggling and evidently talking shit about paying-through-the-nose customers in the adjacent dining room; playing little private jokes on each other at the table that they thought were over the customers' heads; and just generally making the environment almost uncomfortable. It wasn't just sophomoric; it was fraterniacal, word or no word. It really seemed like they needed a floor manager or something, to keep them in line. These misbehaving children needed some supervision. The sommelier was one of these young guys, and while he was nice enough, we had the following interchange: Him: Blah blah blah, wine pairings aren't scary, don't be overwhelmed, blah blah blah, we can customize the pairings depending on your tastes, we won't show you the food menu before you eat, blah blah blah, you just let me know and we can make something work together. Me: Great, yes, I'm definitely getting the wine pairing. Since we won't know the menu in advance, I'd just like to request that you make it as red-heavy as possible. Him: Well, see, there's a lot of fish. I don't really know. I don't really know if we can do anything. A pairing is really supposed to complement the food, you know. Me: Yeah, well. Maybe a pinot noir with one of the fish dishes? Seriously, just make your best effort and I'm sure I'll be happy. Him: Well, it will be really tough.... Wait, I know just the one! As the meal went, it turned out he was totally lying. He just poured me a bigger glass of the pinot noir that was earmarked for a lamb dish, with the fish dish that preceded it. Weak. Was it a good match? Yes. But purely by accident, and really what I wanted was variety, not just more of the same red wine. At the end of the day, maybe he should have just told me that he couldn't make substitutions, if he couldn't. We'd all have been happier. Overall the pairings were solid, with a couple that were really stellar (a madeira and a thick red douro, not a port). But did he even set the pairs? There were at least two sommeliers active in the restaurant while we were there, and I strongly doubt there were two sets of pairings. When we left, I was happy and full, and thrilled by the food. For most other fine restaurants we'd have paid around half as much and had food that was proportionally less-inspiring, BUT service that was just as proficient AND ten times more professional. Fix this problem, and this becomes a guaranteed five-star experience."
211,"The most expensive meal in my life...and somehow one of the best values in my life. How can that be? The drama of merely entering the restaurant is enough to take your breath away, and then the service, calm and sophisticated ambience, little gee-whiz gadgets and tricks, and the food, oh the food.... We were not able to get reservations for the tour, 25 courses or so. But our 12 course tasting was more than plenty at $125 a pop for the food, and I think that once he rotates through some new dishes I will go back for the easier on the wallet 8 course. We did the wine pairing, which they say is around 2/3 the cost of the food. My math says that $90 compared with $125 is more like 3/4ths, but who's counting at a place like this. The wines were just as memorable as the food, and I strongly recommend that you a) go for the wine pairings, or at least some of them, and b) make sure you're taking a cab afterwards. How so much flavor can be packed into single bites, and then how I can get so richly full from these single bites, will always be a mystery. I could go through the highlights, but that would require walking through all 12 dishes. Only one that I'll mention as such a surprise was the Kobe beef with teriyaki reduction, cucumber, and...melon? Who in the world says to themselves, ""Hmm...what goes well with Kobe beef? Oh, I know, honeydew melon of course!"" Genius. Like many foodies-in-training, I seek value. Alenia is a place that proves that ridiculously, guilt-inducing prices can sometimes still be a value when it buys 3 or 4 hours of food perfection."
212,"This is my second time to Alinea. On this occasion my wife and I were fortunate enough to be able to bring my parents along with and treat them to everything that Alinea has to offer. This place is nothing short of spectacular. From the first bite to having Grant Achatz come out to prepare the final dessert. It is great how they keep the showstoppers on the menu (truffle explosion, short rib, hot potato cold potato) and constantly change up the rest of the menu based on seasonality of the ingredients. I am seriously dreading the day, as irrational as it may be, when Chef Achatz stops doing whatever it is he does in the kitchen."
213,"I went for my birthday and was not very impressed for the price we paid. The food was good and in small portions, which is to be expected from a high end restaurant. However, I think what threw me off was the experimentation of food taste, presentation, and smell. We just received samples and whiffs of what the food is supposed to be, with different presentations. I thought the service was stiff and super slow. We ordered the tasting menu, and it took about 4 hours to serve. We were still hungry at the end, but disgusted with the thought of more food. I had high expectations of this place, but walked away with only mediocre experiences."
214,"Innovative flavors, jaw-dropping preparations, beautiful presentations. I was, but shouldn't have been, surprised that in 2006 Gourmet magazine rated it the number ONE restaurant in America (http://www.epicurious.co). Some of the dishes are created from the much-lauded ""sous vide"" cooking which explains some of the unique textures presented in the dishes. The kitchen hums with an unexpectedly quiet and efficient energy. I was unfortunate enough to have only the 12 course, and wish I had room (and money) for the marathon 24. Remember, though, a ""course"" can be as small as a bite-sized morsel (for one example, think Gobstopper on crack). Service was excellent. Case in point: my wife left her butter knife askew on the edge her bread plate and a waiter -- thinking the knife might clatter onto the table -- swooped in to adjust the knife to keep it on the plate! Make reservations and come prepared for an exquisite experience. Upsides: - The best in high-end cuisine. Period. Downsides: - Expensive, but you get what you pay for. - Might be intimidating for the non-foodie."
215,"My husband and I went here for our first wedding anniversary. We did the 20 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. I believe Alinea excels at service, creativity, and it is a meal that I will always remember. However, very few of the dishes are things that I will actually crave and feel the need to eat again (although I did enjoy the pea soup). It was a wonderful experience and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, but I did not find most of the dishes to be mind blowing on a taste level. It was the best food that I'd ever seen, but not necessarily the best food that I've ever eaten. I guess creativity and presentation are pretty cool, but for me, taste reigns supreme. The experience was definitely worth the money, but I don't think it's the type of place where I feel the need to go again. I went to French Laundry with my husband when we were engaged, and I was blown away by all the amazing things that I tasted there. French Laundry is the type of place where I would feel the need to go again on another special occassion."
216,"This review was from a meal I had at Alinea in July of 2010. Unbelievable. Truly. I wish there was a special 5+ Stars rating on Yelp: while my other reviews are based on relative quality from one another, Alinea is not just 1 star better than my other 4 star restaurants; in fact, they are much better than most of the 5 star restaurants I list (all of which deserve their ratings). The bottom line is that there is a difference between restaurants that are absolutely amazing, and restaurants like Alinea that exceed culinary boundaries you thought were static & impenetrable. I was constantly exclaiming to my girlfriend, ""I had no idea flavors and textures like this were even possible."" I'm still not sure how to describe this nearly 5 hour meal, other than it contained more elements of discovery and participation than I had anticipated. In fact, I am revealing some of the details here only because the menu has changed since this visit. For example: * We were instructed on how to create a frame from some pieces in a box. Once this was completed, they took the centerpieces (two flags) from our table and draped them over our frames. It turned out that each flag was comprised of rice paper, with herbs pressed in-between. From there we were instructed on how to create a spring-roll-esque dish out of it. We added pork belly, curry, cucumber, and lime, among other ingredients. * The pillow of ""fresh cut grass aroma"" which our plate was set upon... slowly releasing a complimentary scent to the dish. * The dessert (chocolate w/ coconut, menthol, and hyssop) which Chef Achatz made directly on our table into a piece of modern, edible, art. The entire meal is served, or rather guided by ~6 different people. They explained each dish in some detail and instructed exactly how it should be eaten (such as ""this is a hands free dish, you should pull this off the wire in one bite""). Other Highlights: * Ice cream-like english peas w/ iberico, sherry, and honeydew (each spoonful produced a completely different flavor); * Lobster tempura on a vanilla bean w/ lychee, gruyere, and vanilla fragrance (we were instructed to scrape the vanilla bean with our teeth as we ate the tempura); * Black truffle explosion w/ romaine and parmesan (like its name suggests, this ravioli explodes in your mouth with liquids containing unbelievably rich flavors); * ""Distillation of Thai flavors"" (a shot of liquid that, perhaps due to the power of suggestion, tasted like a complete Thai dish... something out of Woody Allen's Sleeper). The flavors, like the presentation, were outstanding and unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The bottom line: if you love food, you really need to make a reservation here; plan on making your reservation well in advance.. On that note, when I made my reservations, they were taking names for 2 - 3 months out, on the first day of the current month (so if you want to make a reservation for sometime in October, your best bet is to call right on August 1st). If, however, you wait too long, and all reservations are full, you'll still have the option to be put on a waiting list. Also, if you have any food allergies or preferences (Gluten Free, no Sour Cream, etc.) let them know... they'll make alternatives for you. Next time I do this, I'll be requesting ""no sardines."" That was the only dish I really had trouble with. Alinea is/was (depending on when you are reading this review) the highest ranked restaurant in North America by the famous ""San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants"" awards (#1 in North America; #7 in the World, 2010), as well as the recipient of the ""Outstanding Service"" award from the James Beard Foundation, and the #1 spot in Chicago Magazine's ""Chicago's Top 40 Restaurants Ever"" (2010). While this praise raised my expectations to ridiculous heights, Alinea completely exceeded each and every one of them in terms of style, service, and taste. This was, without question, the most unique and wonderful culinary adventure I have ever partaken."
217,"I bookmarked this restaurant for when I would return to Chicago.... I made reservations 3 weeks ahead and was lucky to secure a 6:15pm reservation. We were not celebrating any special occassions but just simply wanted to try this culinary experience and boy, were we impressed! Thomas Keller and French Laundry has competition.... :) FL is an experience in its own way but Alinea, OMG, it would be hard to top this unbelievable, out-of-this-world dining experience. The food, the dishes, presentation, service is all impecable! The food was simply orgasmic to say the least.....bursting with flavor and the artistic talent that goes into the food preparation. I was just thinking out loud to myself that there must be all these chefs sitting in the kitchen decorating all these plates and creating each masterpiece! We were priviledged to sit next to this couple who happens to be one of the investors of the restaurant and we overheard him telling the servers that he just returned from Venice, Italy the very same day and came right in to try the Fall menu before it went away. He added that nothing in Venice quite beat the Alinea experience! :) So he told us that there are at least 25-26 chefs in the kitchen creating up a storm! 25???? That's a whole assembly line on the manufacturing floor of some company, I would think! the 3.5 hour dining experience was simply unbeatable, it flew on by quickly without us realizing it....we were hoping it would never end. The food portion was decent sized and we were not stuffed over the top and neither did we leave hungry, it was a very satisfying, a nice, comfortable feeling! The 12 course flight tasting menu was delightful, as Yelper Jeremy L pointed out; wagyu beef covered within a bowl of pine leaves and the ""pumpkin pie"" served skewed on a burnt oak branch, dish served on a fluffy pillow filled with nutmeg aroma, scallop served in a bowl on top of a dish filled with hot water and chamomile and lavender and the server was joking that we could have steamed our face for facial....it was such a nice pleasure to witness all these creativity in presentation and food decor! Unbelievable! With 81 reviews and 5 star rating, you simply can't go wrong! Great for that special occassion or simply a ""just because"" meal. GO and make that reservation right now! It's soooooooo worth it! Every single morsel of it. I'm not sure when we'll be back to Chi-town but I would dine in Alinea again in a heart beat! Remarkable!"
218,"We went to alinea for our first anniversary. Being foodies like most yelpers and living in chicago for about 7-8 years, we had to try it. I would agree with Patrick N, to not read the reviews too much and just try it for yourself. The surprises and theatrics of the meal are what make it. This was one of the most memorable experiences I have had in a meal, and its worth the price for once every couple of years when they change the menu. We have a full set of pictures from when we went, and i may upload the video of Grant Achatz making our desert. He didnt do this for everyone, so we felt particularly lucky that he did it for our table. The food is of course amazing, and even if you have dietary restrictions, which we did, they will be accommodate every request. There are some reviews of people who did not have an excellent time, so this may happen to some and if it does to you, that sucks because you will be footing a pricey bill. However, for the most part, people leave happy, and thats hard to do when people are paying 250+ a person."
219,"A THOUGHT: I feel like people HAVE to write good reviews of this place. It's required. I mean, you spend so much money, dang it, you'd BETTER LOVE IT! And even if you didn't love it for real, you'll MAKE yourself love it b/c you don't want to look stupid for blowing your rent money on dinner. That being said, this place is pretty amazing. I don't know if it's b/c I'm SUPPPOSED to love it, but it was a great experience, one that I'll remember for years to come. FOOD: The food was not only interesting and complex but aromatically and visually engaging as well. It really is an event. It takes hours. And I found joy in the way I was challenged by the food. It was actually pretty inspirational in some ways. I liked that even after 15 or 20 courses (can't remember how many there were, it's been a few months), I didn't feel over-stuffed. STAFF/SERVICE The staff wasn't mad that we didn't drink wine. In fact, they had a great alternative they suggested, something they had picked out (for the Alcoholics?), some sparkling juice that didn't interfere with the food. WHY ONLY 4 STARS? My rating is more of an in between 4 and 5. The reason it flirts with 4 is because of inaccessibility for the financially challenged. I mean, I like good food and will pay the price, but this is flirting with ridiculous. It's kind of like how I wouldn't pay $2000 for shoes. Even though I can appreciate its design and aesthetics and fawn over it and say things like, ""Yes, it IS genius, it is the perfect shoe,"" I still can't bring myself to buy it. So even though I might pay $500 for a pair of shoes (which I think is still a lot), in the end, it doesn't make me feel great. This is couture food. And I appreciate couture. And I can champion their existence with the rest of them. But the inaccessibility, though it may be celebrated by many, is not a celebrated quality for me personally. And I don't mean to say conversely that cheap production for the masses is a quality I necessarily prize, either (though I can appreciate its contributions as well). But like I say in my profile, no one should really read my reviews anyway. So don't get mad."
220,"Alinea I went with the tour menu. Due to the 24 courses, I won't write a bunch of comments about each, but rather primarily rank the dishes and mention the highlights for each dish. I prioritized the dished by a 1 (dishes I loved), 2 (dishes I thought were good) ,or 3 (dishes that I didn't care for). I had 11 #1s, 8 #2s, and 5 #3s. The pictures really do more justice for this place than my written review. To sum up this dinner, I'll say the same thing I told one of the sommeliers, ""Thank Grant's parents for having sex."" #8 Croquette Cheese filled and one of the first times I thought salmon roe actually complimented a dish, rather than overwhelm it with salt. #19 Octopus They hand this dish to you so I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it. A well prepared dish. #1Chanterelle The presentation on this one was cool. It comes on the plate within a cylinder. Then, they pull the cylinder and the dish pours out on the plate. The flavor on the mushroom cream propelled this one to the top. #16 Apple Fresh flavors of apple and celery. Cool interlude between dishes. #15 Monkfish The monkfish was presented three ways: fried, grilled, and pate. Very good, but too normal for Alinea. #12 Duck They bring this one out on a pillow that is filled with juniper air and then puncture it, so there is this aroma of juniper. Pretty cool. The dish itself was good, but not memorable. #7 Black truffle One of the best tasting dishes I had. He knows how to use truffles. The serving dish was cool because it had an opening in the bottom. #6 Short rib One of the best presented dishes I had, next to the coconut. Layered with Guinness (beer) gel, it looked liked a piece of art and tasted great. I could have done without the peanuts. The rating was more for the presentation. #20 Yuzu Nothing special to me, but the flavor was good. It was a yuzu flavored with saffron and sprinkled with powdered sugar. #10 Chestnut I love maple so it may be my bias. The chestnut base had a good flavor too. #11 Persimmon Two things stood out on this one. The ginger liquid filled ball, it's explosive and I liked it. The brioche pudding was the star of this dish, very rich. I could bathe in this stuff. #14 Licorice cake It was a chocolate-licorice cake and it was well-executed, I could have done without the hay on the top. You are supposed to put the whole thing in your mouth without the use of your hands. I think women could learn a lot from this dish. #22 King crab Not for me. I didn't care for the gel around the crab and the rice on the side looked nice, nothing special on the flavor. #24 Skate Rumor has it; the chef calls this one, Master of the Universe. I forgot to asked why they served it with bananas, it was odd to me. And way too much powder on the plate. It was the only dish that I thought didn't work. None of the flavors went together. #21 Pinapple Like the yuzu, it was good, but nothing special. #4 Lamb One of my favorite for the presentation and the quality of the lamb. I would consider it a simple dish, each lamb piece with a different sauce, but it was near perfect. I also liked the change to chopsticks. It was served on this hot coal that seared the bottom of the lamb. That's hot. #5 Hot potato One of his signature dishes and for good reason. It's a warm potato ball in a cold soup with truffles. You pull the pin out and the potato falls in the soup. Again, the presentation and the truffles make the dish. #18 Venison Just way too much granola for the venison. Once you take the granola off, the meat goes well with the accompanying sauces. #13 Foie gras This was the chef's complimentary dish. I just liked the fact that I could get foie gras in Chicago. It was a foie gras mouse encased in cinnamon bun dough. Sweet goes with foie gras and it worked well. #2 Orange I'm certain there is cocaine in this dish. It's the one I still crave today. That olive oil ice cream is something Ben or Jerry should look into to. Looking around a lot of other people seems to like this dish, also. #3 Coconut I'll remember this one for some time. It had the best presentation of the evening. The coconut ribbon across the middle reminded of the 60s when brides use to wear white to weddings, I miss that color. Taste wise, the cornmeal cake was the star. #17 Chocolate - passionfruit, kaffir lime leaf, soy Not sure if it was the wine kicking in at the time, but I stared at the chocolate for a few minutes. Like in that one Seinfeld episode when Elaine stop having sex and she was starring at the tires go 'round and 'round. I just thought it was cool how they coiled the chocolate. #9 Caramel It came wrapped around a cinnamon stick, crisp on the outside and a rich, juicy bite of caramel on the inside. Great dish. #23 Bacon It's just bacon with a strip of butterscotch. I would take this one off the menu."
221,There are no words. Believe the hype.
222,"Went there for our anniversary. Amazing. Best restaurant in the city that I've been to. 20+ course menu. Edible cocktails, and let me say ""Swine Swing"" for dessert! Words don't describe how good it was. From the Star Wars -esque entryway with secret sliding door, to the impeccable service -the staff new when my husband was thinking of using the bathroom! The staff let me take a peek at the goings on in the kitchen too, and we were escorted to our car! Google Alinea pictures to get a sense of the amazing food. I was thinking we'd be starving afterwards since these were so tiny, but not true! there were so many, we were satisfied. Pricey, but worth every penny. Loved it."
223,"Had dinner at Alinea last night and man, what a very memorable experience. I won't go into detail over every cource, but the highlights for me were the short rib, the hot/cold potato, and the Black Truffle Explosion. The wine pairings were very good as well, and combined with the exceptional food, service, and presentation made for an amazing dining experience. It is very expensive, but worth it!! Still thinking about those three courses, I wish I could have had seconds or third servings..."
224,"I really can't top Monica T.'s review on the food, so I'm going to review their valet. I drove my car up to the valet area in front of Alinea. (The only way you'll know you're at Alinea is when you see the valet sign. ) Initially I think they thought I was lost, because they didn't come up to valet my fancy Ford Focus rental car. I had to wave at them and they came over. So I got out and watched them drive the car away. So while I was waiting outside for Monica T., Jun H. and their friend, the valet was nice enough to point out that they found a street parking spot for my car, so they wouldn't charge me for valet service. My jaw almost dropped to the floor. ""Really?!?!"" I asked as he handed me back the car keys. ""That was awfully nice of you!"" And then I tried to give him a tip, and he refused politely. Never before had I experienced someone being so kind to find me a parking spot and refuse a tip! Perhaps it's the astounding attention to service at Alinea or Midwestern kindess, but I would love it if more people were like Alinea's valet staff. :)"
225,"Ambiance: 4 stars - Nice. Modern. No music (that could be a plus or minus depending on your preference). My particular seat in the house faced a boring corner, but the glimpses I got of the restaurant were...zen. Service: 5 stars - Impeccable. Perfect. Not pretentious. Attentive but not smothering. Very informed. We were the rowdy table and the servers rolled with us; but still laid down the law when we were out of line (no flash photography!). Saw a couple of the servers at Violet Hour later and they were very gracious and sweet. Food: 3 stars - We did the 20+ course tour, half did the wine pairing as well. I really tried to keep my expectations down about the food because I didn't want to be disappointed. Out of 23 we saw, I licked my lips for maybe 6 of them. My stomach literally churned at the sight of one course - the Black Truffle. I've mentioned my dislike of the overuse of truffle before; this was an explosion of truffle - blech. I tired of the pudding texture presented as a cube. The courses that wowed really wowed. Tastes and flavors I didn't think would go well together but were wonderful - sweet onion and rhubarb? Who would have thought it! My friends who did the wine pairings were impressed and enjoyed the wine more than the food (I think). Presentation was exquisite. A great dining adventure that I only need to experience once. I'm giving it three stars because Alinea needs to be taken down a notch. I feel that the overabundance of 5 star reviews is deceiving and skews perception."
226,"I finally got the chance to eat here on a Friday night during my first visit to Chi-Town. I've been wanting to eat here since I had satisfied my craving for the French Laundry a couple years ago. I was in town for a convention and totally had to make plans to come here. Originally I had signed up for the 12-course Tasting menu but my buddy who was also a foodie and I changed our minds to the 24-course Tour menu as we were waiting for our table in the lobby area. We asked if this was possible and the great Chef Achatz told our server that it wouldn't be a problem. Suffice it to say it was definitely a new and enlightening experience. I had never eaten at a progressive American/avant garde/molecular gastronomy restaurant before. This has definitely opened my eyes about what food is and can be. Every course was a mixture to tease all the senses. The presentations were beautiful and playful. The servers were knowledgeable and clear with their instructions on how to go about eating every work of art. The 24-courses came through pretty smoothly and quick, probably because we were on course to be the last ppl there that night. Our time there came at just under 4 hours so that was much appreciated. We also got Chef Achatz to sign our menus. As we were waiting for one of the staff to flag down a cab outside, I noticed the curtain to the entrance of the first level dining room slightly closed. So I peeked into the dining room and surprisingly saw Chef Achatz sitting with his back towards me at one of the tables with his laptop. Culinary revolutionist, cancer conqueror, and computer savvy as well. What can he not do?"
227,"Almost a year after my meal here, I'm ready to take the plunge and write this darn review. Likes - Service. Our waiters were these really cool, hipsterish guys who were SO knowledgeable about everything. It made me wonder if they found people who looked good on paper, then made them adjust their style to appear kind of quirky. - Decor. Beautiful, as expected. - Presentation. I won't go into detail here... Look at pictures or read other people's reviews. Dislikes - Food. Despite the zillions of courses (err, 24 to be exact), there was not a single dish that I considered delicious. A lot of things were interesting, or surprising, or quite good, but nothing was ""OMG I WANT ANOTHER ONE NOW."" Actually, a couple of the course actually made me want to throw up, like the strip of clarified butter. Ew. A certain Porkchop LOVED our meal here, and he was kind enough to treat (as a bribe for me to go to Chicago with him, perhaps), but in no way do I think this was worth the money. You know, looking back, maybe I just don't fare well with these exhaustive meals. I didn't like Per Se either. I'd much rather prefer a simple 4-5 courser from Chez Panisse..."
228,"Come on. It's Alinea. * Don't be cheap. Get the wine pairing, and enjoy! * TIP your servers. At least 20% if not, 30. * Show up early or at least on time. * They were respectful and even made special courses for my friend who didn't drink raw alcohol. Lastly... STOP TAKING PICTURES!! YOU'RE ANNOYING! And it takes away from the experience of other diners....like myself. Eat, enjoy and take in the wonderment that is this experience."
229,"I agree with all the other posters, this is a unique place and a definite must do. The food is imaginative and well executed. On top of that I loved that the service was so welcoming and repeatedly we were encouraged, ""Welcome to Alinea. Have fun!"" They pull off the fun and excitement of such interesting food very well. My only complaint is that toward the end of our meal we were asked, ""Will you be having coffee or tea?"" We both answered coffee and thought nothing of it. When the bill came, there was a $15 addition for coffee. Now I'm not a stingy, penny-pincher, and on a $600 bill $15 is a drop in the bucket, but it has left me with a feeling that Alinea is a little sneaky. Maybe it's nit-picky but it just sort of bummed me out. Luckily, the meal was so good that my memories are still fond. Still a definite must go!"
230,"I've been to Alinea 3 times, it is without a doubt, my most memorable dining experience ever. Alinea isn't just about food, it's about going to Alinea. If I had more disposable income, I'd go once every other quarter instead of once every other year. It's as truly amazing as you've heard. Writing a yelp review seems pointless since if you're considering going to Alinea, then yelp isn't going to change your mind about it. If you've got the dough, go. I'm not going to bother criticizing the place since every time I've been there, everything is perfect. For those people dissing this place for anything, they don't truly understand the concept of the restaurant. You don't go here just to eat, Alinea isn't just a restaurant. You go here for an experience, Alinea is like dinner and a show, but the dinner is the show. The guy on here that compared the price to going to a sports game and a nice dinner before or after, he's full of shizz. Alinea is going to cost you. The time I brought my girlfriend for her birthday and did the wine pairings with the full ""tour"", it cost me more after tax and tip than my mortgage payment did that month. It goes without saying that if you've got the money, and your adventurous with food, you gotta do it at least once in your lifetime. I've found that after several trips, it starts to lose it's luster, since in my opinion, Alinea is more about the experience than it is about the food. You start to see trends in the experience if you repeat your business there. Some things will always be different, but some things stay the same. Chef Achatz is the Willy Wonka of fine dining, but it's his food coupled with the experience of eating the food which makes Alinea unique. From the way you enter the restaurant to the way you are given your check, everything about Alinea is unique to Alinea. Each course comes out on it's own specially made ""serving utensil"" from a metal swing with bacon wrapped in butterscotch, to a wax bowl of soup with a pin in it. Chef Achatz and his astonishingly creative staff deserve all the praise they are constantly given. They aren't the only ones in the game though. Many chefs have gotten into the molecular gastronomy scene. Chicago local Moto will give Alinea a run for the money as it is more affordable, and more interactive. The bottom line is Alinea is absolutely amazing, it's an experience you will never forget, and you should go at least once in your lifetime if you have the funding to do so and a very open mind about dining. I'll be the first to admit, the whole thing seems a lot better when someone else pays the check, but even if it's your credit card that's being run at the end of the meal, you won't ever forget what it went to pay for."
231,"Came here on my visit to Chicago back in September. Apparently this restaurant is really hard to book reservations for but luckily one of my friends called and they had a cancellation so they were able to fit us in last minute. First off this is a very unique restaurant. Totally different from any restaurant I have been to. It was an experience unlike any other. It was entertaining and a feast for your eyes but I must admit not a feast for your tummy. You can definitely tell that the chef put much work and thought into the presentation of each dish. We ordered the tasting menu which came with 13 courses. Every course was unique and different. Some courses were really good but some I thought were just ok. You could do wine pairing with the dinner but we opted to order just a bottle of wine. Which I think is the smarter approach. The wine pairing cost an additional 120 per person on top of the 150 you are paying per person for the tasting menu, if I remembered correctly. It definitely was not a cheap meal and will take a big chunk out of your wallet. So why the three stars you might ask....the staff I thought were pretty uptight. We tried to take pictures of our food and at times our flash would accidently go off and they would come up to us right away and remind us that we need to stop using the flash. What's the big deal right, I am sure no one is bothered by it and if we are paying the price that we are paying I feel we should at least be able to take pictures freely. On top of that there was no music at all in the restaurant and it was really quiet. I felt so uncomfortable and felt like I couldn't talk or act freely. I felt like I was being watch like a hawk by the staff, it was not a very comfortable atmosphere at all. I wish the staff and atmosphere would have been a little more relaxed and chill, it would've made the experience so much better. Total price for the four of us was around 800 bucks. A big thanks to our friend who was so generous to treat us to this very pricey dinner. I definitely don't regret trying Alinea because it's something you gotta try for the experience of culinary art. But would I come back..most likely not. One time is good enough for me."
232,"We finally came here for our second year anniversary. One of the most remarkable and inventive meals that I've ever had. We did the smaller tasting menu, 12 course with wine pairing. It took about three hours. The sommelier was a highlight -- he had a story for each wine that was witty and interesting. I would say we liked 11 out of the 12 wines with 4 that we loved. The experience was orchestrated to every detail by a great waitstaff. The food was beyond my expectations of molecular gastronomy as it truly had the perfect blend of imagination, taste and presentation."
233,"I had the extreme, and I mean EXTREME, pleasure of dining at Alinea a couple of weeks ago and, ever since, I have been racking my brain trying to think of how I can accurately describe such a profound experience with mere words. And... I can't! I don't know where to begin. I don't know how to review it in a way that could even capture the essence of what it's like to dine at Alinea. Ahhh joie de vivre, the tribulations of life really are worth it when you get to enjoy the wonderful places, people and adventures afforded by simply living...uhhh and eating at luxury, world-renowned restaurants doesn't hurt either. If L.A.'s Urasawa is the Space Mountain of restaurants then Alinea is the first class ticket to fucking Mars. Everything from the entrance to the initial greeting by the manager to the dining room to every single motherfucking course to the wine pairing (OH THE WINE PAIRING) to the wait staff to the sommelier, everything was executed with the finest attention to every detail. I loved it. I more than loved it. I wanted to bare its evil, epicurean spawn. I wanted it to slap me in the face and never call me again. The tasting menu was incredible. I mean, it's giving me the vapors just thinking about it. I won't give anything away, but I did dub one dish the ""Black Truffle Bukkake"". YES! Just know that the entire tasting was fucking amazing. They also have pared their menus down to just one, no more having to choose between tasting or touring. We opted for the wine pairing with our meal, which was a genius move on our part. Actually, it might not have been genius, as I don't quite remember everything involved in the dessert courses. Oops. The pleasure of being in the hands of such brilliance was overwhelming at times. Grant Achatz and his team are true culinary wizards. We're not worthy! We're not worthy! These are all people who love what they do and they do it expertly...food, cooking and glorious glorious alcohol. Our sommelier was beyond extraordinary. He had an anecdote for every bottle of wine and delivered it with unwavering knowledge and intoxicating (get it?!) charm. If I could just make my home in Alinea and be lulled to sleep every night by the sommelier while partaking in delicious fare and impressive libations, that would be...*HEAD EXPLODES*"
234,"Dear World, Don't worry, we know we just rocked your body. Your Welcome! Respectfully, -Alinea- Now, let's begin this review. 5 stars across the board. This is a dining experience...a whimsical adventure using the best of your senses for food. Smell, Sight, Taste. The haute cuisine is like no other in America. They have been heralded the closest successor we may see of ""El Bulli"" recently, speaking to the immense impact they have had on the culinary world. The beauty of Alinea is the focus on one ingredient in each dish and bringing it to life. Surprisingly it is usually NOT the ingredient you would suspect, making it so much more interesting. Example: dishes based off Hay, Chestnut and Rhubarb to name a few. Don't worry, Duck, Waygu, Truffle and many others are there as well but those are luxuries you would expect! Course after course you are drawn into the dish with strong scents while you are instructed to close your eyes....or Sight, while you marvel at the presentation of a dish. It's something you should never miss. The service is unlike any I have ever seen, your ""team"" of wait staff help bring the dishes, share insight on the construction of the dish, explain the wine pairings and quickly get you set for the next course. Warning - This is an expensive meal and is not meant to fill you. This is about the passion of food being on display like the art it truly can be when a chef isn't afraid to break out of the mold and turn it into something exquisite. Alinea will tantalize your senses and leave you wishing for more. Quite possibly the most artful mix of food and culinary vision in America."
235,"I DID NOT LIKE THIS PLACE. Try if you must. I'll leave it at that. After writing this review, I come to find out that Grant (the owner) has been dealing with cancer. LOVE AND LIGHT TO YOU GRANT !!"
236,"As others have suggested, the 12 course tasting is ideal. Perhaps because of my experience at Moto http://www.yelp.com/biz/ of having to bail at course 18 of 20, I was a little (molecular), if you will, gun shy. The Moto and Alinea kitchens may share the same tools, but alas, its all in how you use 'em, as they say. In the middle of our 12-course indulgence I do remember commenting that there was actually identifiable food on some of the plates, which was reassuring. Ingredients in their natural and their scientifically altered states shared the same plate, and complemented each other well. 1. Osetra. Actual caviar with foams. Simple and delicious. 2. Pork Belly. Moto, take notes on how to cook pork here. Perfection. A 'thai distillation' shot was also provided with lemongrass and fish sauce flavors to prime you for the course. 3. Brook Trout. Mmm. with roe. Old school presentation to boot (glasses and silverware) 4. Pheasant. Affixed to an Oak twig with burning leaves. In a fried puff with apple and shallot. Tasty 5. Lamb. Flat iron style, 3 chunks of lamb on a hot iron with dabs of pumpkin and eggplant. Paired with 2004 Schwarz Zweigelt, really good. 6. Duck with kumquat. Some reductions here, but actual duck and kumquats. Nice 7. Tomato. Real slice of tomato, figs. Some molecular-ness with the pine nut cheese and olive 'snow', but well executed. 8. Bacon, Peanut Butter, Thai Banana. Mostly molecular-ized. The bacon was just right (hanging from its own holder) and the Peanut Butter had a bit of spiciness. 9. Hay. This is the one with the pillow presentation. Burnt sugar, huckeberry and tobacco flavors with ice cream. Really well done. 10. Chocolate. Yet another dessert course. blueberry tobacco and maple flavors, paired with the classic Warres 2000 Port. 11. Bubble gum. long pepper, hibiscus and creme fraiche flavors presented in glass tube to be slurped up. Was pretty good. Yes, only 11. I think #8 counted for 2 or 3, but was served all at once. Overall, very good and would recommend it to adventurous friends. Please do try Alinea first, if you haven't been to Moto. Our experience at Moto almost turned us away from the genre, but glad we tried it again!"
237,"Prior to moving to Chicago, I actually considered dining here alone (if they would allow a table for one). I was so happy to make and meet friends in the city that had the same interests in food and gastronomy as me. The restaurant can be a bit difficult to find, especially because there is no sign outside. But the minute you open the door, be ready to be impressed and wowed. Prior to this experience, my favorite places to eat was a tie between Providence in Los Angeles and Per Se in New York City-- now, its a three way tie. From start to finish, I loved everything. The staff is very accommodating and knowledgeable. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. I arrived earlier than the rest of the party and i was allowed to sit by the kitchen and watch the chefs and cooks prepare. Sure the price of admission is pretty expensive but totally worth it. If you're weary of the price, the amount of food and entertainment they provide you makes up for it. The three of us dining were all pastry students and of course I had to slip that in during the meal. And to my surprise, Chef Grant Achatz came out to prepare our table side dessert. I was in awe and still in shock from watching him create the beautiful presentation of flavors and textures that was oh so delicious. Truly a memorable experience. I don't think I've ever had a four hour dinner. I will definitely come back again someday."
238,"Wow -- I went here and had the 24 course meal. Holy crap is that a lot of food even though each course is a bite or two. Here's a piece of advice, don't down a bottle of champagne with your friend before you get here -- I made that mistake and was pretty tipsy -- asking the waiter (who I'm SURE hated me) if every course was an 'amuse bouche'. The food was very unique and delicious. If I were to go back, I'd get the 12 course -- 24 was way too much for me. Also, if you don't like white wine (I personally hate it) -- don't get the wine pairing. Most of it was white wine and therefore I didn't drink most of it. The decor is really cool and while waiting for my friend to use the restroom before we left I got to watch the kitchen staff running around the kitchen like a well oiled machine. Love Alinea -- hope to go back soon. :)"
239,"I don't need to go course by course ... but our table was awesome... in the front dining room. Our wait staff was PERFECT. They were playful and witty and they had superman hearing... seriously... they could hear everything... I didn't find them patronizing at all. Just playful. I was a little overwhelmed when I was escorted (twice) to the bathroom... but the second time we had a little laugh about it. I went there for my 30th birthday (dined on Saturday May 14)... and will remember the night forever and ever. Chef Achatz wasn't there because he was at Next that evening, but Chef Matt Chasseur came out for the final dessert and it was awesome. He was super fun to watch - and very kind. Go with someone you like... I mean really like because you are there for 3 1/2 hours and the more you can talk about what is happening the more fun you will have. It doesn't have to and shouldn't be stuffy... have fun and enjoy it. The experience is incredible! Thank you Alinea for making my 30th incredible!!"
240,"Some people just go to dinner for food and drinks, but I want a complete dining experience and that's exactly what I got at Alinea. Alinea is unmarked from the outside, except for a valet parking sign. Once you walk through the doors, its like entering a fantasy land. The entryway is lit with hot pink lights leading to a steel sliding doors that reveal a sleek, modern but welcoming restaurant. Our table of four had the 13-course tasting menu with wine pairing (about 3.5 hours). Each course was an artistic, incredibly constructed masterpiece that catered to all your senses with varying textures, flavors and smells. The custom-made serving instruments went beyond functional utensils, but were engineering feats in and of themselves. And the creativity that went into each dish was absolutely amazing. One dish required you to pop a balloon of clarified butter in order to douse your lobster. Another course began with a pillow of smoke. Once the platter was placed on it, the smoke released so you could enjoy the aroma as you ate your meal. The food service was well proportioned and well paced, and the wine pairings were perfection, enhancing the dish or cutting through the flavors as needed. This dinner was hands down the best meal I have ever had, not just for the food but for the entire experience. One of my dinnermates even said it surpassed French Laundry, often regarded as the best restaurant in the world. All-inclusive Alinea cost ~$300 per person, so this is definitely not everyday affair (although I wish it could be) but if you want to go on a true culinary adventure without leaving Chicago, this is the trip of a lifetime."
241,"So you *think* you like food... When you go to Alinea, be prepared to have your world spun around and turned completely upside down because this experience will completely change the way you think about food (in a good way, of course). Alinea might have just been named the best restaurant in the US (#7 in the world) for 2010, but to me Alinea will always be one of the best experience I've ever had in my life. Chef Achatz have done everything from the minimalistic decor, the use of scents in some of his dishes (lavender air slowly coming out of a pillow that your plate is sitting on), the use of visuals (""plating"" food on a silicone mat on your table right in front of you), the use of unique serving ""vessels"" (a piece of bacon sitting on a swing, come on man!!) to get you to indulge in your senses during your time at Alinea. The ""truffle explosion"" that I had was probably the best bite I've EVER had in my life. I'd love nothing more than to find the remote control that control my life and just hit pause there for a little while (and then maybe rewind and play in slow motion after that). For what it's worth, I would recommend the tasting menu (~12 courses) as opposed to the tour menu (~20 courses). I left feeling pretty full (and a little drunk) after doing the tasting. Do yourself a favor and go with the wine pairings. Some of the pairings were unbelievable!!! I think that night we ended up getting 14 courses with 9 different wine pairings!! The bottom line is that, yes, this is an outrageous price to be paying for a meal (especially with the wine pairing). But this is a once in a lifetime type experience (unless you've just got a lot of money to burn). You're pretty much paying a premium for perfection. Know that EVERYTHING has been thought out as to make you experience what the geniuses at Alinea want you to experience. You just have to hang on for a few hours for the ride of your life. Note: I called ahead to ask about the camera policy (I didn't want to be rude and understand why some restaurants just don't allow photos all together). But Alinea only forbid flash photography (just turn up your ISO and turn off your flash). The waiters are really nice about telling you when you need to hurry to take the photo before something gets cold."
242,"Let me preface this review by saying a few things: first of all, if you are a person who thinks places like Bucca Di Beppo are acceptable places to eat, you won't like Alinea. If you think fast food is actually food, you won't like Alinea. If you are the kind of person who thinks that the more money you spend, the more quantity of food you should get, walk AWAY and never think of coming to Alinea again. Now, having said all that: ALINEA IS FOOD PORN. There is no way you could possibly replicate the experience at home, and probably 99% of all restaurants in this country couldn't come close. It is as good as everyone says it is. There were only two things I would have changed about the experience. Firstly, the reservationist was a bit snooty. For a Five Star dining experience, I kind of expect that the whole thing--from the people you talk to on the phone all the way to the guy who hails you a cab at the end of the evening--should be top notch. Secondly: the staff at Alinea are a veritable treasure trove of information. However they seemed to be a tad stiff and if I attempted to go beyond the usual ""what's this??!"" question format, they seemed uncomfortable and scurried off. Finally--the reviews are true. The 20+ tasting course is a lot of flavors (not necessarily a lot of food), but it is well worth it, as are the expertly selected wine pairings. To prepare for this meal, I ate very little all day leading up to it and had a nice round of cardio at the gym before I went. In summation: if you are a foodie and have some cash to burn this place is TOTALLY worth it. GO."
243,"I'm not even going to attempt to write a review of this place. It was, quite simply, the best food experience of my life. Words don't really do it justice. It's a fantastic experience from start to finish: entrance, service, food, kitchen (25 chefs at once!), wine pairings, even the restrooms. One word of advice - don't be so stiff here. It seems like that kind of place at first, but the staff really loves what they do and we had a lot of fun with them. As fantastic as the food was, we wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much if the people creating it and bringing it to us weren't as fun, yet professional as they were. You'd expect the latter, but not always the former. After the fact, I didn't think twice about dropping this much money on a meal here. It was well worth it. Go. Just do it. You'll be amazed."
244,"This is a totally different dining experience than I have ever had, anywhere else, ever. A destination in and of itself. The food was wonderfully executed, the wine pairings were fabulous, the service was great (and not overly formal; one gets the sense that the wait staff is trained to read their diners individually--if you want want formality, I'm sure they could do it, but if you want to be more relaxed, joke around, be a little chatty--they can do that too. This sort of adaptability is hard to accomplish, but for me, the hallmark of truly exceptional service). Alinea was good enough that the cliche ""in a class by itself"" doesn't seem cliche. I couldn't do it all the time--who would want to do it all the time?--but I'm glad I was lucky enough to go at least once. By the way, make sure you schedule some time. We started at 8:30, and left the restaurant at 1:30 am!"
245,"It pains me to give Alinea only one star. My entire trip to Chicago was planned around eating at Alinea. For an entire year I have been eagerly awaiting the dining experience of a lifetime.... Unfortunately, it was only memorable as a nightmare. The food was presented beautifully and the technique is out of this world. But the taste was terrible. The savory dishes were so salty I wanted to gag and the sweet dishes came too often. The chocolate and menthol dish at the end tasted like tooth paste and there was WAY too much of it. I really, really wish I liked it but I found myself trying to hurry up and eat so I could get out of there. The staff was so attentive and the experience was top notch but I hated the taste."
246,"I've only been to Alinea once, so I can't give an all-encompassing take, but I will definitely be going back at some point, despite the 800 dollarish tab for two. Without spoiling anything, Alinea was full of unexpected twists and turns from before we even found our way inside. While the restaurant provides a novel approach, full of science-meets-cooking gastronomy, the distinct flavors have the substance to ensure that the experience is not gimmicky. Alinea has a vast wine list that is filled with treasures that are surprisingly (relatively!) reasonably priced at a fraction of the markup of many high end restaurants. Sadly, though, unless you're dining with a big party, it's pretty impracticable to limit yourself to a single full bottle for a meal that covers the entire spectrum of familiar flavors (plus some that are totally new to even well experienced first-timers.) We instead opted for the wine pairings which included about 12 half-glasses for the Tour menu and incorporated a few familiar and many obscure varietals. However, at least on this particular occasion, neither of us felt like the pairings were truly on, and got the impression that a lot of the wines were selected more for their gross margins than their compatibility."
247,"5 stars is not enough. My husband and I have been going to Alinea every year for the 24-course tour since its opening. Charlie Trotter's, Tru, Arun's. . . all are good but no meals stand out in my mind as much as the ones I have had at Alinea. Grant Achatz is a culinary genius who knows how to play with his food. Each dish is not only a piece of art, but also an incredible creation of flavor, texture, and most importantly, imagination. My words cannot describe the amount of thought that apparently goes into each creation. This was so much better than a night at the theater! We first found Grant during his early days at Trio and followed him like donkeys following a dangling carrot to Alinea. Totally, totally, brilliant."
248,"After dining at Alinea, I was torn about how I felt overall. After a couple days I realized that, in my opinion at least, Alinea may have to be reviewed in a different context than other restaurants. I'm not going to claim that I know good food, or that I have an amazing sense for anything culinary, but I do feel that I have a strong appreciation for the heart and soul people pour into creating and maintaining their vision of a restaurant. I've heard some people compare Grant Achatz to Willy Wonka, and I would have to agree with that assessment. I enjoyed myself and my meal immensely. I would have to say that the service and presentation of the food stood out the most. While outstanding service is self-explanatory, the presentation of each course was meticulously crafted. Everything down to the custom-made plates and sculpture-like items used to present the food was inspired. The taste of the food, however, was varied and not always in a good way. I realize that I am not going to be wowed by every single course, but my palette left me wanting more of the 'one bite' style courses and less of the heavy, rich ones. I understand that it's just how the cards fell, but it was a bit of a bummer for me (because, darn it, that Hot Potato / Cold Potato dish was so good!) I supposed I will have to consult the Alinea book my wife purchased to see how I can make that and the awesome Bubble Yum stock. That's not to say I didn't appreciate each course. The flow of the meal was perfectly paced. The starting courses revolved around lighter, cleaner flavors and slowly progressed into rich and heavy offerings before transitioning into the dessert portions. Over the course of the 3 1/2 hour meal, the staff starts to feel like old friends (especially if you've had some wine). Which brings me to another point - they specialize in wine pairings and offer a small selection of beer only. So you won't be able to booze it up while you eat :) Overall, I feel that this was indeed a special once-in-a-lifetime type of meal. It did not change my life, nor did it make me feel like I ascended to some higher state of consciousness. Instead, it was a pleasant and unique diversion from anything you might come to expect from your typical critically-acclaimed restaurant. I count myself as extremely lucky to have experienced it."
249,"WARNING SPOILERS: If you want to be surprised by your meal at Alinea, do not read this review. 25 courses over 4 hours. The food was a strange and delightful trip. Very interesting to have a 140 yr old classic dish like the Pigeonneau a la St Clair served in the middle of a post-modern deconstructionist / molecular gastronomy dinner. It showed they could do ""normal"" cooking at an extraordinary level as well. Let me describe some of the dishes: Oxalis - tiny little sorrel flowers that taste like baby snow pea shoots in a juniper gin gelatin. Served on a shiny bent ""guitar pick"" eaten as a bite that is both crunchy (the flowers) and soft (the jelly). A dish called Lilac because of the lilac foam around the dish. The center of the dish is what ""seafood chowder"" would taste like if they served it in Heaven. Clams and Scallops in cream but with fresh celery, herb sprigs, and a surprisingly sweet addition of tiny melon balls. Tomato with olive oil ""snow"" and olive-fig ""chocolate"" sauce. Served with fresh figs with a large tomato plant brought to the table to proved an ""aroma"" addition to the course. Butterscotch Bacon and Japanese Cedar Smoked Date Parfait. Foie Gras with Fennel and Shiso (Japanese Mint) on a fork - just warm enough the Foie Gras melts like butter in your mouth with savory delight and a slight crunch from the Fennel. As you finish the Foie Gras, you drink the fresh Japanese Peach juice in the bottom of the glass for an explosion of lightly sweet fruit that clings to the fats on your tongue from the Foie Gras. Crab Parfait. This one was hard to wrap my brain around. The flavors were of ginger, spices, and carrots - like a delicious carrot cake. The texture was like a fluffy and airy parfait. Then at the bottom was *POW* king crab in gelatinized duck fat. The contrast of the flavors and textures was basically overstimulating all my taste buds. Two types of Rhubarb on Goat's Milk Cheesecake: A freeze-dried crunchy rhubarb sorbet and a transparent rhubarb ""glass"". These are served on top of pillows filled with lavender scented air. The weight of the plates slowly diffuses lavender from the pillow into your table area as you eat the delicious cheesecake and rhubarb dessert. All the food was absolutely amazing and definitely 5 stars. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I also got the wine paring (which raises the price to $500/pp from $300/pp after tax and tip) and I felt the wine pairing was not worth the extra $200. I guess I am pickier with my wines and prefer mostly earthy reds -- the wine pairing was mostly whites, champaign, and a strong aquavit (and fire-water is not ideally the first thing they should serve on an empty stomach for a 25 course meal). I would highly recommend the tour with just one or two glasses of wine or beverage ala carte and you will save about $160-170 over the full pairing."
250,"First of all, it's plain from the outside. We thought the taxi driver dropped us off somewhere else, but there was someone there to open it. It opens to a hallway that ends. I felt like that scene in Alice in Wonderland when the room ends and it gets smaller. All of a sudden, an automatic slide door opened. We jumped, but I must say that was really cool. Such a great culinary experience, for reals. My friends and I got lucky with the reservation since we were going for Lollapalooza. We're obviously not from Chicago area and were definitely excited a table opened up. I can't believe how Grant Achatz relearned taste and then created these amazing dishes. We had a tube that had 3 different flavors, hibiscus, then pomegranate, then bubble game... HOW THE HECK DOES HE DO IT? Also, Grant, please adopt me. The short course is 16 dishes. We were all stuffed and carrying our stomachs to Second City. The Sommelier was very entertaining and I loved his wine choices. I'm a light weight, so I could only take a few sips from my wine pairings. Thank goodness I was there with male friends, who helped me drink it. However, I did finish one that stood out which was the K Syrah with my wagyu kobe beef steak and dried A1 sauce. OOooh.... then they came out with a pillow filled with lavender scents and I felt like I had fallen into a very happy dream. It was just amazing... also thanked it wasn't allergy season. My boyfriend got me the 50lb Alinea book. Hopefully, one day I will be able to make 1/4 of a dish."
251,"Pretty intense. 26 courses, lost count of the wine pairings, clocking in at over 5 hours. *Loved* most of them, and liked the rest just fine. Comes with the territory, it's pretty avant-garde. Excited to return! (Saw some people comparing Schwa and Alinea, they are extremely different. Schwa is intimate and rougher, Alinea more sterile and ordered. Both good!)"
252,"BEST meal i have ever eaten in my life. Not only is each dish presented in a unique & beautiful way, turning food into art, but each dish tastes as good as it looks! Not a single dish was disappointing. 5 stars to each and EVERY dish...only downside is that most of the courses are literally ONE bite. So after eating that bite, you wish you had more to enjoy, but that's it....just ONE bite. The meal is 22 courses, but you won't feel stuffed when you leave due to size of course. We went in a group of 6 (max # they will take)..and the experience lasted 4 hours. There are 2 sizes for wine pairings you can add ($160 additional, or $100 additional for 2/3 the pour of each wine). It's too bad they don't have a non-alcoholic pairing. They had this cranberry/pomegranate juice mix that was delicious...a little fizzy, a bit tart, but mostly sweet. This is the first restaurant I have been to without a sign! I guess it's so well known that it doesn't need any more attention than it already has...so don't be surprised if you drive by a regular looking building. Only sign with the restaurant name is the valet sign. Reservation process: On the 1st of each month, phone lines open for booking 2 months later. You will have to call and hang up repeatedly until you get through...and when you do, you'll be put on hold. But..it's WORTH IT. Regarding the meal (see pics for each course): No bread, no amuse busche. Just start off with the first course and finish through. Favorites: Mussel, razor clam, hot potato/cold potato, black truffle explosion, & yuba. Some of the dishes are very playful...as in you ""play with your food."" Others are displayed in a unique way, such as ""antennae,"" where the yellowtail snapper is hanging from a wire & you eat it without using hands. ""Lemongrass"" looks like a mini-fishtank, or what reviews call food in a test-tube. The ends are sealed with a jelly/ dragonfruit so the contents don't spill out. You suck on it like a straw and everything (mostly liquid contents) fall into your mouth. Lastly, there is a dessert finale where they plate the whole thing on your table (lined w/ silicon sheet). Pay attention to the WHITE liquid! Small detail you might miss if you aren't observant. When they put this liquid on the table, it forms SQUARES, not circles like most liquids do!! Super cool! The chocolate mousse dipped in liquid nitrogen tastes better when it melts a little b/c it is similar to chocolate ice cream; in the beginning, it has more of a ""dry"" crunch taste. It's also cool to watch them turn the banana cream liquid into creme brulee right in front of you. DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT SURPRISE SPOILERS regarding playing with food. When we first sat down, our waiter brought us what he called ""centerpieces."" Looked like a little baby garden grown on a rock with soil. He told us it was for decoration...and not to eat or touch it. Later, this centerpiece actually became our salad! (They bring you a baby pair of scissors & u cut your own greens and place it in the bowl of dressing & tomatoes...which we originally thought was a soup). I loved the element of surprise. There is another dish (short rib) where you have to assemble the plate and add the ingredients to make your own giant ravioli. (DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH SALT...i mistakenly added all of each ingredient..which is fine..but don't add all of the salt). There is a dish called hot potato/cold potato, where there is a pin that holds a fried hot potato ball on it among other things...you pull the pin down and out, and the hot contents fall into the cold potato soup below it and you take the whole thing like a shot so you have the sensation of both temperatures in your mouth. Very cool. Lastly, there's a dessert dish where there are different colored cubes which represent different flavors. You get to choose, mix & match the cubes, to blend the flavors in your mouth. Choose wisely, b/c not all combinations go well together..haha. After reading this, I might have ruined the surprises, but it'll still be very fun. Loved Alinea, loved the food, the service, the art, everything. Will definitely return one day."
253,"Alinea..... Grant Achatz you're a genius!!! My friends and I came to Chicago over the MLK weekend for the purpose of trying out Alinea to see if it lives up to all the hype... food has never been the same since leaving Alinea. My favorite was the canard, puff pastry is just not the same anymore. =( Presentation was awesome and dessert... Chef Achatz can make my desserts anytime!!! This place is a must try before you die! period!"
254,"BEST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD! We did the Tour menu which consisted of 27 courses! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and we actually got a tour of the kitchen. They have 23 chefs working at all times--- the restaurant is only closed from 4AM - 6AM every day--- the other 22 hours are for prepping, cleaning, and cooking--- I thought that was pretty amazing. It's hard to start with ""highlights"" when I would say 15 of the 27 courses were the best dishes I've ever had in my life. I think the three that stood out were the prawn wrapped sesame stick, the pork belly spring roll, and the venison served on a cherry infused fireplace log. Everything is great though--- I thought that I would have a little trouble enjoying knowing the bill that was coming at the end of the meal, but as hard is it may be to believe, it's worth every penny for the experience. They create amazing flavors that truly challenge your pallet and are served in such creative ways. Some dishes come out with hidden food encapsulated within serving dishes, some require self preparation, some you think are merely table decoration until you end up eating them! I would recommend the tour menu- we originally were going to do the tasting, but it's kind of silly to save $150 when you are already talking about $600-$800 meal for 2. Do the tour, enjoy the extra 10 courses that include lots of amazing deserts. I will say they have a good variety of wine bottles in the $45-$75 range, but even with 1 bottle of wine you're looking at $700 for 2 on the tour menu. Will I go back soon? Probably not unless the economy drastically changes, but I definitely will be remembering the experience with my fiance forever."
255,"Yes, it lives up to the hype. Yes, it's totally worth it. Insanely creative. Polished deconstruction. And most of all, fun. Wow. I'm still in awe of it all. This is minor, but if I could change one thing, I would have opted out of the wine pairing. We came into this with a ""go big or go home attitude,"" and we got to taste some interesting varietals...but for $150 per person, the pours were quite small. On a do over, I would have just purchased a couple of bottles instead."
256,"After working for a foodie business and eating at hundreds of delicious ethnic/foodie/gourmet/Michelin starred businesses all over the US, I can proudly say this is the best damn meal of my life. I'm so lucky to have a boyfriend who believes that a sensual (but ultimately ephemeral) experience as unique as Alinea is easily worth $500. Eating here is a huge treat, a once in a lifetime opportunity (unless you host something on the Food Network) and worth every penny- really, I promise. Alinea truly delivers on every level- I'm proud that the Midwest offers the creme de la creme by international dining standards (could El Bulli really be better? I guess I'll never know). Read up on Alinea's expediting process before you go; pique your interest by watching youtube vids on the molecular gastronomy devices Grant solicits. Page through his ""cookbook,"" and watch some of Mike Sula's brilliant Reader vids on their collective mad genius. Consider all of it opening act to your tummy's greatest show. Grant and his team are savants (duh) but also dorks of the highest level; food nerds who treat dining as a video game, to conquer each evolving level and eventually save the princess. You supply the gold coins, of course."
257,"I'l say it very simply: Not only was dining at Alinea the best culinary experience I will likely EVER have... it also set my standards so high that it's very likely I will never rate another restaurant 5 stars. Mind blowing food and service that would be worth flying to Chicago from Canada for one day, and then go back home right after the meal. If you can attend an Alinea service, do it. You'll thank yourself forever."
258,"Framing: My partner and I went to Alinea for our 10th Anniversary. This was a special occasion so we opted for a special restaurant. The final bill was around $700 including a 13 course tasting menu with wine. Arriving at the restaurant, initially we thought we had the address wrong because it is about as nodescript as they come. Walking in, however, we were transformed into a truly magical experience with decor that was stupendous. We had the 13 course tasting menu and enjoyed every minute of it. The presentation of each course was amazing and the food really good. If there is one thing both of us questioned, it was the sheer volume of pureed or ""foamy"" foods. I did get a feeling much of what we were eating was prepared earlier, which is a bit disapppointing. Service was better than I expected. I can afford, thank God, this kind of restaurant and pretty much any restaurant in Chicago. Yet, I don't feel I have to act like I can, nor do I feel the servers must be snobby to make me feel special. I KNOW this is a special restaurant and I know that only certain people can afford it. But SOME (not all) of the staff were a bit pretentious. Could they afford to eat there if they did not work there? My particular server was really good, and I liked the fact that the entire staff worked together to ensure your meal was always moving. After the meal, we took a peak into the kitchen with our waiter and about a week later we received an autographed copy of our menu, which really meant a lot to us. Would I go here again? Probably - maybe for 15th Anniversary. Would I take friends? Not likely. I would rather have a nice dinner at a reasonably priced restaurant with friends where I can treat the whole crew for the price of one meal at Alinea. Great food. Great ambiance. Great service. Great presentation. REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE. And I don't feel like less of a person for saying that!"
259,"Believe it or not, I ate here in September 2009 and had this review saved for several months! So, here it is, for what it is: Imagine waiting in line at the Post Office being totally disgruntled when you get a text message saying that you're going to Alinea in two days. Well, it happened to me, and truthfully, I almost couldn't go. ""Couldn't go??"" you shout? ""Are you crazy!?"" Well, working until 9pm on a Wednesday night leaves little room to arrive at a 9:30 reservation. But thanks to my managers who let me leave early and the fact that I changed, met my boyfriend, and practically broke the speed of sound driving there, we arrived right on time! ::phew:: Now to the main event. I was so nervous walking in, it was almost as if I was going to meet the President rather than sitting down to dinner. You walk down a long corridor and sliding doors open where lovely servers greet you warmly. To your right, you catch a glimpse of the kitchen where the best food is being prepared just for you. How exciting! My boyfriend, his friend, and I were seated upstairs. We were fully prepared to do the 23 course ""tour"" as it is called, but we did not get the wine pairings with it. Instead, we were encouraged to try a nearly 30 year old wine that would go with almost everything we tried that night. We were given nothing but the best service, knowledge about what we were trying, and care. Alinea loves you. And you can't help but love it back. I can't count the number of times my boyfriend and I looked in awe over our friend's head at what wonderful treats we would be given next. We were scolded like children for not answering a question or paying attention to a story. But it can hardly be helped! When you are given pheasant tempura skewered on a burning branch of oak leaves, or a tube of long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche to mimic the taste of bubble gum, what else can you do but gasp in delight like a 5 year old meeting Mickey Mouse for the first time at Disney World?? You clap your hands in delight and close your eyes encasing every taste, smell, and sound your senses explode upon you. It's like a dream you never want to end. But end it does, and what an ending! The table cloth removed, and a special silicone mat placed over the table. Two chefs come out (one of them being none other than Grant Achatz himself!) and pour an overwhelming amount of freeze dried blueberries, chocolate mousse, and even a tobacco sauce all over the table! We were given nothing but a spoon and then we had to duke it out on who ate what and got the last bites. The servers were funny, caring, and catered to all our needs. We asked questions, we engaged them in conversation, and there was nothing but smiles all around.They weren't pretentious or snobby. Although we ate for nearly 3 hours, I was comfortably full and couldn't ask for anything more. I have nothing but praise and good words for Alinea. Anyone who says less was probably having a bad day before they stepped inside. At the end of the best meal of your life, you are given a small menu listing what you ate during your ""tour."" Asking nicely, we wondered if Mr. Achatz would sign our menus, to which the waiter agreed. ""Refine and Redefine!"" is written on mine. It holds very true to Alinea's mantra. Did I say that Alinea loves you? Because I love it right back."
260,"Been here a few times, and they never disappoint me!!! There's always a surprise in our meals, and the service is always exceptional!! Looking forward to the next visit again!"
261,"I can probably die now after the meal. Dining won't ever be executed at a level as high as this for the near future. Prepare to watch your pallet grow throughout the meal. I can literally re-imagine every dish in my head, it's basically ingrained in my head. That being said, everything here is fun. They're formal, but not pretentious. I've been to some pretty stuffy places in New York that act like it's a privilege to dine there, if anything, it's a privilege to dine here, and they're very professional about it. The food is great, the presentation just as great. The involvement of the diner is a key aspect of the experience. I dined here back in July when they still had the 26-course tour running and I know the menu's changed since then, but a few of my favorite courses were the pork belly spring roll, the truffle dishes, lobster, king crab, tournedos, lamb, chocolate, and squab. There are a few pointers I'd like to give to fellow yelpers, though. Don't look at the menu at all. I know that you're paying a huge sum to dine here, but going in with the an open mind, not knowing anything, and letting Achatz dictate everything is the best way to experience it in my opinion. And finally, leave the cameras and notepad at home. There are plenty of people taking pictures, just steal there's and enjoy your meal. There isn't a thing that hasn't been said by a yelper or blogger already, so give that a break. Besides I'm sure the entire Alinea team will like it that way better, anyway. *****"
262,"Yeah, it was alright. I snagged the grand tour reservation with 3 days notice, dining 2 days later. Don't give up on the wait list, baby. I probably enjoyed the chicken liver pate with bacon, caramelized onion paper, and vin santo in terms of tastiness. I probably enjoyed the duck, foie gras and mole flavors surrounded by the warm fragrance of heady nuts and spices in terms of interestingness. Environment and food seemed ""yang"" to me. So I had to balance that out by making constant references to licking beef curtains with the wagyu beef presentation. The dinner, maybe it could use a course called ""promenade,"" where a favorite server would take us for a walk around the block to break up the pace of four and a half hours of gastronomic self-indulgence. The wine pairings were excellent with fine verbose explanations. The menu composition, Edward Tufte would be proud."
263,"I dont understand how a restaurant like this can garner anything less than 5 stars, aside from hmmmm, ....maybe the fact that getting a reservation here is so onerous it's almost not worth it, almost. actually it's worth everything. worth every penny spent, including the ridiculously expensive but so worth it reserve-wine pairing. It's been months since i ate here and only now catching up on my yelping but i am a huge fan and would fly out again just to eat here and fly right back to nyc. Now that Grant Achatz has succeeded w/ his second effort Next, i am hoping that he gets bored and looks for a new challenge here in NYC, where eaters are much more skeptical and harder to please."
264,"We went to Alinea last night, which completes our trio of experimental dining (Moto, WD-50 in New York, and now.. Alinea). I have to say... Alinea is great. The entrance is really cool, the service is what you would expect, and the food is excellent. Achatz is indeed a genius, but in the end... the experience isn't really that memorable. I feel like he cut his teeth at Trio, and is delivering interesting, but not amazing food, in an interesting but not amazing space. What I would say tho.. is if you're going to spend $450+ on dinner for two... and you've got one place to go in Chicago, we'd still go to Moto. Achatz's food is interesting, but not amazing... which when you're dropping that sort of cash, you need to be able to walk away and remember your experience for months to come. At Moto we had exactly that... both for the service and food. So... if you haven't been to Moto, I'd go there first... if you have... Alinea is great, but it won't be quite as fantastic."
265,"A million things have been said about the wonders and delights that rest behind the star trek entrance that is the front door of Alinea. This place is not for the faint of heart or the frugal diner. To put it mildly, this one meal is going to set you back a month of rent, and we are not talking about the rent for a studio in Pilsen. More like a two bedroom in Lincoln Park or the Gold Coast. Yet, despite the high cost, it is an amazing journey that any self proclaimed foodie should experience at least once in their life. Grant Achatz and his team of scientists and wizards design dish after dish of wonder. This meal is a sensory blitzkrieg. After every dish, I could not imagine how they could outdo themselves with the next only to be even more surprised with the next mixture of flavors and smells that assaulted my palette. Alinea is not for those who don't appreciate a good meal. This is art in its highest form and takes a true connoisseur to appreciate the subtleties in each dish. If you decide to go, I recommend that you take the 24 course tour with the wine pairing. You should take the opportunity to try all of the creations and flavors that they have prepared, but it is a ton of food so come hungry. Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience....... savor it and enjoy!"
266,"After dining at our nation's culinary mecca, The French Laundry, I had been curious to check out Chef Achatz's, Alinea, after learning that this young chef who was once working at TFL back in the late 90's, launched his own restaurant that made it to #10 in Pellegrino's Best Restaurants in the World List in 2009. Finally, tonight was my chance, and I was blown away. Upon arrival, I was a bit in shock. The outside was ultra-modern, almost resembling a lounge. It was everything that Thomas Keller is not: modern and chic. Fresh baked breads? Nope. Butter and 3 types of Salt?! Nada! Chocolates to take home? No way! I applaud Achatz. He highly deserves his ratings. To leave culinary mecca and create a completely original and imaginative restaurant and food concept is rare these days and something that is hard to find. From start to finish, everything is not just delicious, but also beautifully presented as if it were a work of art and at times, requires a diner's personal interaction with the foods..it's all quite amazing, and truly, an unforgettable experience. So....12 courses at Alinea for $150 or 9 courses at French Laundry for $240? You pick...but I still enjoyed them both for their distinguishable styles and opposite philosophies that still resulted in some of the best dishes my taste-buds have ever had. PS: The staff has a sense of humor and tends to be very engaging. How refreshing :o)"
267,"Have you ever been to Wonderland? How about Oz? I have, in the form of Alinea. I never knew these whimsical places actually existed until I brought my palate here. Course after course I fell deeper down the rabbit hole. Words like creative and unique don't even come close to describing the fare served at Alinea. Grant Achatz really is our modern day Willy Wonka. As our 4 year anniversary approached we really felt there was no where more suiting than Alinea to spend it in. Chicago has become a favorite city of ours and I, a huge fan or Mr. Achatz. We made our reservation for the 29 course ""tour"" menu and started counting down the days. As we made our way down the pink glowing hallway my heart was racing with excitement. Even though we were 30 minutes early for our reservation, we were greeted by name and sat anyway. We made our way up the stairs my eyes darting, looking for even a small clue as to what our evening would bring us. The minimalistic decor provides a blank backdrop so the food really is the star. A caterpillar like cascade of purple flowers sat behind our dinner table and set the tone for the whimsy to come. The overall feel of the atmosphere is genuinely fun. There was a level of service and class without it feeling stuffy or pretentious. No dish was ever explained in a condescending manner, no waiter was rude, and the room filled with laughter as the courses continued to arrive. Some dishes shined more than others, some were true to the ""molecular gastronomy"" fad, while others simply showcased simple and amazing flavors. The dishes to me that were the greatest stars of the night were as follows: Course 5- A do-it-your-self pork belly spring roll. At the beginning of the meal we were presented with 2 sheets of rice paper beautifully draped over a small wooden stand. In the papers were flowers and herbs. When the course arrived, we assisted in constructing a sort of tee-pee for the rice paper to sit in. Sweet and succulent coconut curried pork belly was spooned into the center and you chose your own additions off of a plate of 11 ingredients. I choose black sea salt, lime, onion, and additional herbs. I wrapped it all up and was wrapped up in the flavors of that dish the whole night. It was by far my favorite. It was like Thai street food made glamorous. Course 10- Thai banana with a square of frozen Guinness beer with mustard and pecans. I truly wished this course was more than one bite, it was the definition of balance. Course 12- Powdered peanut butter, when mixed with your saliva returned to an original creamy peanut butter texture followed by Cayenne pepper. In terms of creativity, I felt this dish stood out amongst the rest. The way the flavors developed from peanut to pepper was indescribable. Course 13- Foie Gras, which seemed to be frozen, pushed through a sieve, over pear and white wine sorbet. My boyfriend and I both couldn't stop talking about this dish. It was like heavenly Foie ice cream. I wanted another scoop! Course 18- Part of what was called ""cocktail hour at Alinea"". A passion fruit Hurricane with all the traditional New Orleans flavors. This drink was like first sip of ice cold Kool-aid on a hot summer day when you are 8 years old. It was perfection. Course 23- One pound cake bite with strawberry and lemon sitting on a bed of almond sugar. We were literally instructed to enjoy this dish like fun-dip. Eat the pound cake then lick the vanilla bean and scoop up the almond sugar. Besides the fact that it was pound cake perfection, any chef who uses fun-dip as inspiration gets an A in my book! Course 27- Earl gray cookies, lemon custard, candied pine nuts, and caramelized white chocolate served on a pillow of Earl Grey scented air. Can I say anymore? This dish was really like cookies and childhood. It was playful, rich, sweet, and had a wonderful presentation. 5 hours later, I was on a culinary high. My belly was near the point of exploding, but it was all well worth it. I love that the whole meal brought you home and brought you back to childhood. The raspberry transparency was like a grown-up fruit roll up. I even caught myself making little faces as I ate it. I loved course 24, which involved us sucking gelee (grown-up Jell-O), creme fraiche (grown-up pudding), and Bubble Yum out of a tube. What is more fun than that? Even the playful nature of the dessert that is prepared on your table was simply a chef playing with food. Nothing about the meal was too serious, too full of itself, or too out of reach for any palate to enjoy. My night at Alinea will be one I will never forget. Meals that leave an impact on me are some of my fondest memories of life. I look forward to all the things Chef Grant is going to do and all of the minds he is going to open up to ""fun"" cooking. I for one, will always trust my Willy Wonka and take one more bite down the yellow-brick road."
268,"Yes, it is absolutely worth it. Dining at Alinea is not so much a meal, as it is a completely captivating experience in which the act of eating is unequivocally transformed. There are moments of disbelief interspersed with instances of revelation, leaving you with a jumble of incredulous memories composed of a myriad of fantastic sights, smells, and tastes. The two tasting menu options have now been replaced with a single 21 dish tasting for $185, keeping in mind that some of these 21 ""dishes"" are a small plate that may arrive with 2 or 3 others to be served together as a single course, for a total of 16 courses. The wine pairings are offered inconspicuously for a mere additional ""three quarters"" of the price of the tasting. The flavours are amazing. Delicate spheres of sherry explode with each mouthful, its sweetness cutting into the richness of the freeze-dried pea puree, interspersed with the savoury highlights of powdered Iberico ham. The intensity of the tomato dish blew my mind - it is hard to believe that each tomato was simply blanched and dressed with only olive oil, salt and pepper, and still able to produce a natural depth of flavour that I often associate with hours of braising or meticulous reduction. The play and exposition of flavour profiles also produced spectacular results. King crab and plum became the basis of a three-dish course, each revealed in turn after the completion of the former. The essential components remained evident and undisturbed, but the course flowed smoothly from a cold king crab and buttermilk parfait with chervil juice; to a crisp salad of king crab with fennel, plum, and bean sprouts; and then finishing off with a lush, piping gratin of king crab, punctuated perfectly with a delightful star anise encapsulation. And if you have any predilection for truffles, you will not be disappointed. The classic hot potato dish still remains topped with the largest slice of black truffle I will probably ever eat in one mouthful, and the black truffle ""explosion"" will literally stop you in your tracks. Heed the waiter's warning to eat the delicate ravioli in one go, as there is no room for regret if you spill even one drop of the most intense, jaw dropping truffle broth that literally explodes in your mouth and simply overwhelms all your senses with pure deliciousness. Playful themes that engage and delight will continue to meet you at every turn throughout the night. Deconstructions and re-interpretations of classic cocktails start off the meal. South-east Asian flavours will meet you in their presentations of pork belly wraps and shrimp. A shout out to Escoffier makes an entrance, accompanied with period-appropriate placings and cutlery, and a splash of red wine to complete the picture. Nothing happens by accident, as every moment is conceived and carried out to a tee. Granted, this does require the omnipresent hovering of wait staff which does make you feel watched at every moment (which you are), but it does serve the purpose of making sure that you have the most perfectly executed meal you could hope for. Service is so catered to making sure you are happy that we were given complimentary cocktails simply because the bottle of white we ordered was not immediately available and had to be chilled (we promptly received our bottle only about 2 courses after we received our cocktails!). I am tempted to go on and on, but the degree of detail, thoughtfulness, and creativity (and of course, deliciousness!) is simply something you have to try for yourself. A meal at Alinea is absolutely worth it, and will be unlike anything else you will have ever experienced. And yes, I saved my 100th review for Alinea. : )"
269,"I am so late in writing a review for this place. However, my memory of the food and experience has not dwindled one bit! This place is incredible, as most have written. Suggestion: go big or go home. If you are eating here, go for the 24 course. It is well worth the culinary journey! The food is... just go there! Sneak Peak: They have the ability to take the flavor from bubblicious gum and create a shooter, just for you! And that was the C class of the experience! I look forward to my next culinary journey at Alinea!"
270,"I wanted so badly to give it four stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Alinea is everything you read in all of these reviews. The show is amazing. The service is incredible. The food cannot be described in words that do it justice. Here is my thing...the wine pairing. Unless your palette is ready for the extra couple hundo, it is maybe not a good idea. If someone were to ask me my favorite wine, I would say Manage A Trois California Table Wine. So what amazing wines they were offering were pointless to me. Since I cannot truly give them a four star because of my inexperience of wines, they deserve the five stars because of everything mentioned above and I would go again, but only if someone else paid."
271,"Alinea is a one in a lifetime experience, worth exploring. If you have one meal on earth, let it be the tour. Alinea is a distinguished restaurant with minimalistic charm, the facade is understated, but as you walk through the front door, down a long corridor to doors that slide open, you are greeted by a smiling host/hostess. Without a reservation, don't expect to be seated. And make your reservation well in advance, they typically book up to two months ahead. Alinea offers two menus, the tasting (12 courses) and the tour (24 courses). Both menus can be paired with wine by their master sommelier, Scott. Each course is innovative, inventive, spectacular and unbelievably arranged and presented. The inventive techniques applied, from creating foam, pureeing vegetables, grilling meat on hot stones and freezing with liquid nitrogen. From the gentle presentation, the unprententious atmosphere, to the exquisite timing, Alinea is the epitome of dining excellence. Never did I wonder about a nuance of my experience, anticipation of my desires were satiated."
272,"My date brought me here a little while back. Everything was absolutely perfect. As soon as my date parked his car, he was greeted by his first name. The great service started from that very moment, considering most establishments would never simply know one of their client's names from the moment they step out of their car. We were then escorted into the restaurant, which was beautifully appointed. The food and service were out of this world. I was presented with flavors that I never experienced. The presentations were ones I would never imagine. The servers were incredibly courteous. Our wine pairings were incredible. My entire experience was one of my best overall restaurant experiences. For the guys out there...if you'd like to impress your lady...this is certainly the place!"
273,"I admit it's been roughly 9 months since I've been here and am just now getting around to reviewing Alinea. It could be due to laziness but let's use the ""too amazing to put into words"" excuse. Alinea shouldn't be listed as a restaurant and instead as an experience or Chicago attraction. Everything in your environment is mute so you can use all of your sense to engage the food. Achatz and his incredible staff are in the business of creating 'awe'. We dined here during the fall and were lucky enough to be one of the first seatings to experience the new menu for that season. We chose the twenty three course tour and set out for a two and a half hour long culinary experience. Our sommelier guided us to eventually choosing a thirty year old Riesling which was excellent and paired well with most of our courses. He was extremely knowledgeable and I learned a great deal since I'm not a huge wine drinker. I'm not going to go over each course since that would take forever and having been so long since I was there, an injustice to them. Each course was amazing, the combination of flavor profiles, textures, presentation and smell was impeccable. Each ingredient melded well with everything else on the plate and the course following it. Not only are the flavors well developed but the methods for delivery are too. It's a very interactive experience in which you will eat food in unconventional ways. The real highlight for us was when Grant Achatz came table side to prepare Chocolate. We all tried to think of something witty to say as this occurred but the spectacle just took over and I'm pretty sure I personally just stared like a kid meeting his sports hero and maybe muttered ""AWESOME"" a couple times. By far this is the best food experience you can find in Chicago. The waitstaff were a little austere at first but warmed up a great deal once they saw that we were here to really enjoy the food and not just sit here for the upper class brownie points. They worked with the kitchen to pace the courses just right. They answered our bevy of questions and even joked a round a bit once the dining room cleared out some (we had a late seating). When we were winding down to the last few courses they chatted with us and we talked about other spots in the city. Chef Achatz was nice enough to autograph our menus and then we were on our merry way. Twenty three courses does leave you just a tiny bit full, but manageable. Dining here is going to take some planning. Reservations can top out a month or more ahead of time and it's spendy. I believe the bill came to about $850 for three of us with drinks before gratuity. It's a very special experience that I would recommend having at least once. And let's face it, you're never going to grab a table at El Bulli so why not get the best of this hemisphere?"
274,"Probably the longest meal of my life, yet I'm not complaining. I think it's time to talk about the finer meals in life because I don't want people to think all I do is go eat Chinatown Ice Cream Factory and go to Public Libraries every day of my life. I had the pleasure to go to Alinea with 5 of my best friends last year on our first trip to Chicago. The stars were aligned when we rented a duplex which was literally 5 blocks away. We were there for a week long film festival, and there was indeed no better way to kick it off than scoring a table at Alinea! We had the 24 course tasting menu that started at 915p and lasted until 2 in the morning. I'm not going to go into each and every dish, but I will let you know that when the meal was over and we were walking home from the restaurant, I can still remember the joy that within each and every one of us, and the smiles on our faces. Alinea is ranked top 5 in America and top 10 restaurants in the WORLD, so know that this does not fall in the category of ""cheap eats"". What it will fall under is ""most memorable meal ever"" and ""best eats"". When they said life is too short to drink cheap wine (and eat cheap food), Alinea was one of the those restaurants they had in mind. If you love food, and have money to throw around or are celebrating a life changing event, this is the place to spend it. Best of luck getting a reservation! Definitely plan as far ahead as possible!"
275,"I still laughed at myself for being a poor girl having a $580 meal by taking the Halsted bus which drops us right in front of the restaurant. :-) Comparing our experience at Tru, Charlie Trotter's and Everest, Alinea really tops it all for their innovative and still tasty food, the all-senses experience, impeccable yet not snobbish service. However, that was also the most expensive meal compared to the other 3. Well worth it! Now that I've had Alinea, I don't know where we should go for our next special meal? Afraid that no restaurant will live up to the standard Alinea has set."
276,"Plenty of reviews here, so no need to elaborate, but here's my take: Awesome place for event dining, and something that's definitely worth doing once if you can swing it (heck, go once a year or once a season if you're posh). I went with two friends for no reason other than that we wanted to give it a go, despite it being way out of the ballpark for us financially. We made our reservation, dressed up, and had a blast. We went with the smaller menu (PLENTY of food - I don't think I could have handled the full 24-course option) and just ordered a bottle of wine (sure, we were dropping lots of money, but we were trying to be reasonable) and felt like we got the full experience. Food was wonderful, service was great, and the experience was a big thumbs-up. My one recommendation to diners is to relax and have a good time. We felt like we were the only ones in the joint enjoying our meal: everyone else was stone-cold quiet and somewhat serious. So have fun, get tipsy, and ask your waiters lots of questions. Once the waiters figured out that we were chatty, they started spending more time with us, sharing a few extra details, and challenging us to identify the main ingredients. It's food -- it's not that serious. And it's food with a sense of humor, so it's REALLY not that serious. Save your pennies, go once, and have fun!"
277,"Expensive? Yes. But the meal of a lifetime? Exponentially yes. My boyfriend and I are, admittedly, food obsessed. Is 87% of our relationship based on our mutual love for food? Maybe. And so, with no gift certificates or special favors, we celebrated that fact by making the trip to the holy grail that is Alinea to celebrate our one year anniversary last last December (i.e. December 2007). It was fucking heaven in a plastic straw doused with white truffle oil and infused with juniper scent. We now live in New York and I'm still getting familiar with the food scene here but I can say with some confidence that no restaurant here will replicate what we experienced at Alinea. The service is top-notch. There are about 5 or 6 people that attend to your table and if you're like me, self-deprecating to a nasty fault and self-resourceful to the max, you will feel silly at first having so many people attending to you. But, advice: Indulge in the pampering. You are, after all, paying for it. Note: They give you a menu at the end of your meal displaying every indulgence you stuffed down your gullet. Note: Opt for the 24-course tour. Doy. Note: You will be full. Disgustingly, delightfully full. Note: Should you decide on the 24-course tour, your dinner WILL take 5 hours. Note: If you close out the restaurant, they may let you into the kitchen before you leave so you can meet the wondrous chefs who created the works of magic you took seconds to suck down. Note: The experience is worth it."
278,"yes, it's pricey. yes, it is a great experience. yes, the food is interesting and the staff is amazing. yes, it is worth the money. no, i don't feel the need to ever go back again. it was an interesting culinary experience ( I recommend doing the full tasting menu with the wine pairings- just dig into your wallet and get the full experience), and actually very fun and unpretentious. I think everyone should go to Alinea once."
279,"Meal of a lifetime. We ordered the Tour menu (20+ courses) and a reduced wine pairing for two people. Yeah, it was expensive. Really expensive. Almost as much as my rent. But as a wannabe foodie, it was worth every penny. It's as much an experience as a meal, and I never wanted it to end...until the final course, which ended the meal on such a note that I finally felt ready to go. Even the wine pairings were awesome, illuminating different types I had never even heard of. Service was amazing and attentive, while still being friendly and not stuffy. If you do the Tour, try to not have crazy plans early the next day. It doesn't make you feel full, but it does take many hours to ""recuperate""."
280,"I don't really need to go into how good the place was or launch into a discourse on molecular gastronomy for that matter; these topics were likely covered in great depth by the other 148 reviewers. What I do wish to impart upon you, faithful Yelp reader, is that I didn't recognize a single thing I ate at Alinea, and this is what made it great. Most restaurants are adept at giving you what you want, or more appropriately, what you expect. When you visit Gibson's, you know you're going to wait a half-hour beyond your reservation, that your steak will be charred and tasty, that the big-as-your-head dessert will be free. You go there precisely for this reason. McDonald's (on the other end of the beef purveyor spectrum) has enjoyed spectacular international success because they deliver a predictable experience no matter where you are or what time of day it is. Breakfast is over at 11...people set their watch to it. The point is that many great restaurants thrive on providing a consistent experience, in line with consumer expectations. Alinea eschews this maxim with all it's being. Rather than providing an inviting, warm entrance, you get a down the rabbit hole/MC Escher trippy hallway, leading to a Star Trek sliding door and no discernible hosts table. Their food does not look like food. If you eat there while the menu remains the same as it was during my visit, you will stare while a piece of frozen meat hangs in front of you, evoking some walk-in freezer from a discarded episode of Dexter. Expect lots of foams. Alinea is the counterpoint to every other restaurant in the world (with a wink and a nod to Herv This, Wylie Dufresne, Ferran Adria, et al). Your ears hear ""tomato mozzarella salad"", but your eyes see a mess of white meringue and a bunch of funny-colored cubes of stuff. Then you taste mozzarella salad and wonder how in the hell that happened. Repeat this a dozen (or more) times and hope that your appetite for amazement keeps pace with your appetite. I am a rooster illusion. Also, Chuck Klosterman has graced us with his Advancement theory, which posits that there is a cultural condition wherein a true genius creates a piece of art that 99% of the population perceives as bad. This isn't because it /is/ bad, but rather because the average consumer is not Advanced and therefore does not understand the underlying genius therein. Achatz (and Alinea by association) is Advanced because he does not do what is expected of him (California Cuisine), but he also does not do /the opposite/ of what is expected of him (Klosterman fans can refer to IV for more on Advancement theory). Alinea isn't the opposite of anything; it doesn't ignore the existence of outstanding ""conventional"" restaurants. It's off in it's own little universe with El Bulli and the Fat Duck, orbiting around some totally different sun that you and I can't see."
281,"Recently ate here on a trip to Chicago and would definitely recommend it to anyone serious about food. The tour could be shortened by 4 courses - a bit of palette overload going on. It's nowhere near the quality of French Laundry or Fat Duck (I've seen comparisons to both), but it is good. It is a bit pricey for what it is and I'm being really honest here. I have no issues paying $500-1000 for dinner per person if it's worthwhile. This, was not. The wine pairing for the tour was a bit too much. Luckily our table was in the smaller back room -- I say luckily because the other dining areas looked, well, not as cool. Oh and the sommelier is one seriously opinionated person! Question any of his judgments or really really snide comments and it's like World War III. Overall his picks were solid, but he could do without the slanted commentary."
282,Alinea was Awesome. Just do it cause we did. It's all about having fun with an element of surprise. I can't really say anything that hasn't been said except the sommelier has some crazy hair. I couldn't stop staring at it.
283,Okay I think this place has 175 reviews so taking the time out to write another is a little silly but for what it's worth ... We did the long menu with the wine pairing ...it's too much. I am a big eater and I didn't get through it all I had to pass on a few courses...and they were bit size....I tried! That being said ...it was amazing! It is expensive but if you break it down into a night of world class cuisine and entertainment ...to include drinks for the whole night ...about 4 hours then it's not much worse then dinner and drinks for 2 and good seats at a concert ...For what it's worth.
284,"The food is amazing. The experience is simply unforgettable. Alinea is more than just amazing cuisine, it's about the presentation of the meal, and as cheesy as it sounds, how it evokes all your senses throughout. Chef Achatz has truly created a dining experience that must be one of the best in the world (ranked 6th worldwide as of this writing, according to Restaurant magazine, 1st in USA). as someone who doesn't go out of my way for fine dining ALL the time, i really enjoyed myself here and appreciated each and every one of the 18 courses. dishes such as the oyster leaf, short rib deconstruction, and rabbit 3-ways, were ingenious. the infamous black truffle explosion certainly lived up to its name. the last 4 courses were reserved for dessert. dishes that stood out to me were the lemongrass test tube shooter, and - what seems to be really the perfect way to end a meal - a deconstructed frozen chocolate dessert, created with a variety of ingredients, of which are literally painted onto your dinner table. frankly speaking, to me this meal felt like an art gallery being presented to you one piece at a time. if you get the chance, Alinea is well worth the experience."
285,"Warning: excessive use of exclamation marks below! I had an evening (it was about 4hrs) at Alinea last night and I woke up dreaming about the food this morning. It was absolutely AMAZING!!! Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was just perfect! Everyone was attentive and very friendly. Felt so comfortable and not at all pretentious. The anticipation of each course was like opening several thoughtful and wonderful gifts. Our server overheard me wishing my sister and bro-in-law a happy birthday and they got a special bday treat/course! So thoughtful!!! They also offered us a kitchen tour after our meal- it was the most impeccable and organized kitchen I had ever seen. There were over 20 chefs in there! Recommendation- do the wine pairing and any extras they offer. I was stuffed by the 15 course, but my taste buds thanked me for going on. When I took my first bite I couldn't help, but audibly say ""yum"" (several times) and didn't think anything could make it better, but the wine just enhanced the meal. Such unique wines at time, but delicious and luscious all the same. They had an extra course of risotto with shaved truffle- best thing I've ever put into my mouth!!! Did I mention that the night was AMAZING?!?! I will go back again and again and again. Everyone should experience it!"
286,"Nothing compares to Alinea. Nothing. We've been twice, and both times were able to rate it five stars, despite the overly pretentious service and atmosphere. Honestly, it's just amazing food and a mind-blowing experience. Definitely worth flying to Chicago for. And always spring for the wine tasting-- it really increases the pleasure of the meal."
287,"My husband took me here for Valentine's Day. I thought it was very upscale, but non-pretentious. Neither of us had been there before, so when we entered the hall and didn't see the door. I thought, what the hell did he get us into. Once the automatic doors opened, I knew we were in for a delight. We did the 12 course tasting menu. We tried foods that we would have normally shied away from. The bison in particular, it was tender and very flavorful. It was funny because I was pregnant at the time and I kept going to the restroom to stretch my legs. When we got home and into bed, I went into labor. My husband seems to believe the bison had something to do with it. LOL! It was a pricey, but well worth the dollar. The ambience was wonderful, the staff and the other patrons were friendly. I will definitely go back."
288,"Indescribably amazing! The only thing I can add to what others have said about this place is that if I were Charlie Trotter, Rick Tramonto or any other chef at any other great restaurant, Alinea would keep me up at night!"
289,"I am not a tasting menu girl. I am a ""give me a plate of my favorite pasta and let me stuff my face with it girl."" (I know, classy.) I like to know what I am getting, which is usually the same thing I got last time if I loved it. But boy, am I glad I got to have this experience. Getting here for the earliest reservation of the night can be a little uncomfortable... you are greeted by 3 or 4 people standing around in a very spare and modern room... in silence. Where's the music? But once the space starts filling up, and you're onto your 2 or 3rd pairing of wine (which I highly recommend you get! Its unbelievable!), this incredibly special experience becomes truly exceptional. Every dish was amazing. But the ones I loved the most were a pork belly DIY asian spring roll type thing. I am glad I've had some model airplane building experience in my youth, because this one required some assembling and disassembling of the place setting. (Probably also helped that it was one of the earlier dishes, before the buzz of the wine set in!) Also fantastic was the most amazing piece of beef I've ever had... incredibly marbled (was it wagyu, perhaps?). I don't think I can ever go back to having a normal slab of steak. Like going to your favorite band's concert... when dinner ended, I felt a bit misty, because it will be far too long before I get to have this kind of an experience again."
290,"I went during the first month or so of the opening, getting extremely lucky to get in on a Sunday night with just a phone call. I don't know how to review this place. This was hands down the best meal of my life, if I can even call it a meal. It was more like a religious experience. Some of the more memorable dishes...granola rolled inside a very thin tube of fruit leather that has been hardened to the point where it can crack. This is served over a creamy nut-based ""yogurt"". You crack the granola tube into the yogurt to produce wonderfully crunchy glasslike shards. The textures were very interesting. Another one that I really loved was a 'spongecake' which involved a piece of very light spongecake on the end of a vanilla bean used as a spoon to eat some sort of fruit foam and dehydrated fruit bits. Again excellent combinations of unusual textures really added to the experience. Grant Achatz is a true artist. I hope to visit again one day, when my wallet recovers :)"
291,"I'm a little embarrassed to admit I called Alinea to make a reservation the day after I booked my flight to Chicago. I couldn't resist the chance for the Alinea experience I have been hearing and reading about for years and I didn't want to risk second thoughts on the part of my dinner companions. Do: plan for a leisurely meal, dress up (there is a dress code), be able (and willing) to forget price for one evening, and build up a healthy appetite beforehand, follow your server's directions (to avoid food disasters - lets just say I had a tapioca accident) Don't: forget to mention food preferences or allergies, be afraid to try new things, expect a single ""main"" dish, choose dinner companions you can't spend three hours straight with (no flat screens or music), memorize the menu beforehand (ruins the surprise) We had the touring menu and chose to forgo the wine pairing (not all of us were big drinkers). Instead, we ordered champagne to begin and a bottle of red wine for the meal. I can't begin to describe every dish we ate (some were quite mysterious even now), but a few of my favorites were the roe, foie gras with kimchee, and yolk dishes. No need to memorize or photograph every dish, you'll get to take home a copy of the menu. The service was attentive and smoothly delivered (without being snooty), the decor was modern and understated, and the experience of exploding, swinging, erupting, melting food is both surprising and delicious. I won't say this is/was the best meal of my life (mom's home cooking is hard to beat), but it is definitely the most memorable dining experience I've ever had and (in my opinion) worth the cost. Note: While waiting for our coats in the hallway, we caught a glimpse of Chef Achatz hard at work in the kitchen!"
292,"Went recently for my boyfriend's birthday. Second time there. First time I had the 25-course dinner. It was a five-hour affair -- I think I got deep-vein thrombosis from sitting there for so long. The problem with the 25-course is that it just gets overwhelming after a while, especially with the wine pairings. After two and half hours you are drunk and jaded and can't believe you are just halfway through. This time we got the 12-course, with wine pairings. It was just perfect. We sat upstairs in the back room. Big room, but only three tables. The beautiful thing about paying $300/person for dinner is the amount of real estate you get. The food was always interesting, and often fantastic. Service was as polished as can be. And while there is always going to be a certain amount of pretense at a place like this, it seems rather good-natured here and often comes with a wink. This place deserves its high reputation. They do it right."
293,"Incredible, but be prepared for a test of your culinary endurance. I went when I first moved to Chicago, as some friends came to help me move in (although only after they secured reservations at Alinea). We had 9:30PM reservations, and although I expected the 20+ courses, I had no clue we would be there until 1:30AM. I nearly passed out at 11:30 around the 15th course, but a succulent veal course revitalized me. [Upon rereading my friend's blog, it was the pork cheek that woke me up] The menu is also really neat, and I enjoyed a great apertif recommended by the server. The service is impeccable. Throughout the entire four hour meal, it truly felt like we had our personal wait staff team of three. You can view photos (and read my friend's recap) of my meal here: http://www.foodite.com/f"
294,"My bf and I did the tour (29 courses = 5 hours of stomach and eye heaven) It was an unforgettable dining experience. From wrapping your own spring rolls with rice paper with flowers between two sheets (pork belly), to the 3 layer plate that has 3 separate dishes stacked one on top of each other (lobster course), the earl grey pillow wafting out grey essence while we ate earl grey cookies and lemon custard dessert (earl grey), to the art on the table (chocolate course - which I was told took 2 years to create) everything was beautiful and most things tasted amazing. My favorite courses taste wise were the yuba, pork belly, thai banana, goose and bubble gum. My favorite courses look wise were the yuba, pork belly, lobster, hot potato, bacon (swine on a twine), venison, okay pretty much all of the dishes. It really is eating art. That is why I took a picture of almost every course and have looked at it about 10 times now. I just had dinner there on Sat (Mar. 6). I have to also say the service was amazing as well, which just added to the great dining experience. Everyone answered all of our questions well, you can tell they were knowledgeable about the food and wine and loved their jobs."
295,"Most of what needs to be said has been said in reviews here. Acknowledged today as the best restaurant in the US, Alinea lived up to it's billing last night. Dinner, running three hours, was paced beautifully. The service...spread across at least a half dozen servers...was note perfect. The food ran from good/fun to amazing to transcendent. (For a listing of the menu visit http://www.alinea-restau). Grant Achatz, the chef, actually was not only in the restaurant cooking but came out to prepare the dessert table. How rare is that for superstar chefs nowadays? Just a brief story on this. Our table was cleared and a silicone table cloth was brought in to cover the table. That was the ""plate"" for the dessert. A chocolate mousse, frozen in liquid nitrogen, was smashed on the table and surrounded with various flavors...coconut, menthol, hyssop. We chatted with Grant about his inspirations for such a creative menu. Very nice, thoughtful guy. Ambience was welcoming, service great, food amazing. Dinner wasn't cheap but was worth every penny. Most highly recommended."
296,"Food is awesome - presentation/taste/pacing/ordering/etc. Wine pairing is not well paired or necessary. If I go back, I'll order by the glass/bottle."
297,"Like everyone else, I was blown away by Alinea. The precision of every course, every progression, is a revelation. Definitely spring for the 25-course menu and the upgraded wine pairings. it's worth it. If I had to come up with a criticism, I would say that I wish the atmosphere was a little warmer and more relaxed and that the service had the easy perfection of Trotter's. But those are minor quibbles if quibbles at all, and this is still easily the best restaurant I have tried. Getting reservations was actually pretty easy for me--I called around a month and a half in advance, and had no trouble getting a Friday night 25-course."
298,"If I could give 10 stars, Alinea would get them all. Ate there two nights ago and am still completely awestruck. All other food seems like slop now. I""m completely ruined!!! Took pics and/or video of every course (lots of action on the plate there!). If you're interested, they're at http://picasaweb.google.."
299,Damn good cocktails. Even better bites. Overrated by most
300,"A lot has already been said about Alinea so I'll just add some highlights of the 5 star meal: * I had a lot of trouble getting a Friday night table for the weekend that my wife and I were going to be in Chicago but finally was able to secure a table the day before. My recommendation to get a table: get on the waiting list for your desired time and call 24 hours before to see if there have been any cancellations. Worked for me. * Food was fun, fantastic, and beautiful. There are only 2 menus, the 12 course Tasting ($125) and the 24 course Tour ($175). Very expensive, yes, but worth it (in my mind) for a truly unique dining experience. If you're in from out of town like we were, I recommend springing for the Tour. If you get the Tasting, you may see some great looking dishes being brought to other tables that you won't get on the Tasting. * If you're on the Tour, don't eat any bread. You will barely be able to finish all the food in the Tour itself. Trust me on this. * The Sommelier poured us some great wine to drink with our meal but it was *extremely* expensive so be careful if you're trying to keep your meal cost out of the stratosphere. I'm talking $22 a glass! * Service is some of the best I've ever experienced. * As you can read in the other reviews, the food here comes in very novel and strange presentations with unusual combinations of tastes - but it's all great. Make sure to come with an open mind and you'll really be in for a treat. * Very cool entryway and door to the restaurant - but sort of unmarked so don't be confused. Cool interior. * They give you a printed menu to take home with you after the meal, which is helpful for remembering what you ate (24 courses is a lot). You can also take pictures with your camera or camera phone if you want to. In summary: I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!"
301,"Wow, what an EXPERIENCE. There were 5 of us and one of the people in our party had made the reservations about 2 months in advance. We were visiting Chicago and had already planned a weekend of food - Taste of Chicago, that famous pancake place (I can not remember the name - The Pancake House maybe?? haha), and of course Alinea. We got pretty dressed for the occasion. Men please remember jackets only. The ladies wore dresses and it seemed to suit the night. I was happy they sat us at a nice big round table. The restaurant is very minimalistic which I liked and so clean and in order it really was a pleasure just to be there. The service was quite quite good....interestingly enough I was NOT impressed most by the TASTE of the food. I was impressed by the whole creative dining experience thing AND the fact that they were able to tailor our 12 course ""tasting"" to some specific dietary requirements that I have. This means: no dairy, no eggs, no meat (except white meat chicken), nothing fried or heavily cooked in oil, no butter (minimal if any), no coconut. For each course I had something a bit different...something tweaked to suit my needs....if they had milk I had soy milk, if they had fried, I had dehydrated. One of the coolest parts was the beef centerpiece (I had himachi instead). I really do not want to spoil it for anyone who plans on dining here but you will know what I am talking about when you get your centerpieces..... In terms of taste I was wowed but at the same time I was not....weird right? Two of the dishes had coriander in them and it really overpowered what was underneath it. One fish dish in particular I did not care for the fish at all....i found it WAYYYY too fishy BUT in Alinea's defense I know that the fish was not bad it was simply a fishy type of fish....my Asian friends who we dined with loved the fish so I knew it was A OK just not my thing (I wish I could remember what kind of fish it was!) The desserts are so different and a lot of fun to eat. This is definitely the type of place you must be prepared to be spending anywhere from $200 - $400 a head (maybe more!) All in all a great dining experience indeed!"
302,"Alinea has recently been hailed as the Best Restaurant in the U.S. (and #7 in the World). With such status, I had extremely high expectations and quite honestly, was a bit worried that I'd expect too much and be let down. Instead, I was *COMPLETELY* blown away by my experience at Alinea and would have to whole heartedly agree that it's the best restaurant I've been to in the U.S. (sorry, French Laundry). What's even more remarkable is that Alinea has only been around for 5 years, during part of which Chef Grant Achatz had battled tongue cancer. Words can not adequately describe the phenomenal meal I had at Alinea. It is a true experience in all forms - the surprise of hidden sliding doors, interacting with the unique presentations of each dish, anticipating what the next extraordinary course would bring, and most importantly, having my taste buds delighted and pushed to the limit with innovative, incredible food. You really do just have to experience it for yourself. The food at Alinea is progressive, ambitious, artistic, and totally original. It was creative without being gimmicky. Chef Achatz and his team take modern American cuisine to a whole new level with their inventive genius. The service was impeccable. Every need was anticipated before we had to ask for anything. The staff was professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable. I learned so much about the food and wine. [BTW, I highly recommend the reserve wine pairing. The wine beautifully complemented the food - an impressive feat with ~20 courses!] The only thing I didn't love about my experience at Alinea was the ambience. The dining room (there are 3) is a small, rectangular room with modern, minimalist dcor in cool grey, beige, and black tones. It felt impersonal and lacked warmth. It's a good thing that the food was so mesmerizing; else it'd be awkward to be in such a sparse room where you are so acutely aware of your neighbors. But maybe that was intentional, and they want you to just focus on the food. A few of my favorite courses... ENGLISH PEA - unlike anything I've ever eaten before! Peas were mixed with frozen burrata cheese and dusted with Iberico ham powder. It was ice cold yet creamy, salty, sweet, and meaty all at once. The sherry ""bubbles"" and melon would also transform each bite by accentuating different flavors. TOMATOES - this dish transported me to another place. I was initially confused and intrigued when they put pillows on top of the table. Then I started to smell the fresh, grassy aroma emitted by the pillows. Once the plate of heirloom tomatoes was set on the pillows, more of the aroma was emitted as the pillows deflated...it was like eating ripe tomatoes straight from the garden! If summer had a taste, this would be it. PORK BELLY- this pork belly was ABSOLUTELY ORGASMIC! It had been slowly simmered in coconut milk and just melted in my mouth. I wanted more! HOT POTATO - great things really do come in small packages. A metal pick slides down to drop a piece of butter, hot potato, and black truffle into the tiny wax bowl filled with cold potato soup. Let me say that again...Truffles. Potatoes. Butter. Totally my kind of comfort food! This was so delicious, it took all my restraint to keep myself from licking the bowl clean. EARL GREY - I was ready to dislike this dessert because I detest early grey tea, but this was surprisingly my favorite dessert of the evening. It was a moist and crumbly early grey cake served with pine nut custard, lemon curd, and rose gele. The flavors were so well balanced - buttery, sweet, tart, and with just a hint of bitterness from the earl grey. The caramelized white chocolate noodle also added a playful yet tasty touch. CHOCOLATE - The ultimate demonstration of fantasy and wonder at Alinea. You will have to see this for yourself...a tableside presentation like no other! After our 4 hour meal, I felt inspired and completely enchanted. Alinea made me fall in love with food all over again. I've had many great meals, but few have left me feeling so awestruck. The $185 tasting menu is pricey, but still a ""bargain"" considering the number of elaborate and well-executed courses...a small price to pay for one of the best meals of my life. **For a full review and pics of each course, go to my blog link under my profile**"
303,"Really? This isn't 5 stars across the board? Whoever didn't give it 5 stars is plainly picking at a nit, or simply doesn't get it. Or doing the ""hey, check me out! I know more than Michelin and everyone else!"" Seriously ... if you're coming to Yelp to convince yourself to go, don't go. You will be disappointed. I take it back. There might be a question, and that is: is it worth the $$$$? I won't bury the lede ... yes! It ain't cheap, but if you want a meal that you will flat-out be talking about years from now, this is the place. Was every single bite and meal the greatest thing I ever had? No. But I remember each and every single bite like it was yesterday. So does my wife. I look at our menu with fond recollections. Seriously, save $15/week for a year (skip pizza night every other week, really), and the have a night that you will remember. And isn't that the best thing about food, the memories? Anything that sticks with you after the moment is a win."
304,"From Alice in Wonderland: ""Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin; but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever say in my life!"" Alinea takes you down the rabbit hole, turning worlds upside down, clocks backwards, or rather, food on thin air, scents developed from nothing and flavors exploding out of tiny containers. I loved it. I kept expecting our wild haired sommelier to ask, ""and who my dear, are you?"" since this food clearly knew who it was and where it should be. Alinea is a ride and worth every minute."
305,"There is not much I can write in this review that has not been previously written. Each course was wildly imaginative and it is evident that Grant Achatz is ingenious for creativity and presentation. When you leave and later reflect back on the 20+ courses you will realize you went on a full gastronomic trip that stimulated every one of your senses. My experience at Alinea was unlike any other. The service is top-notch and what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the service to be pompous and pretentious. Most of our servers had a dry sense of humor, which I love, and kept us thoroughly entertained throughout the many courses. I was never made to feel uncomfortable or patronized. Alinea is something that you should experience at least once if you are able."
306,"Alinea = A Celebration of Food. It started with the simple question, ""How long is the dining experience?"" To celebrate a special anniversary and as my final meal before my Chicago Marathon, my partner in culinary crime and I headed to Grant Achatz's celebrated molecular gastronimic restaurant, Alinea. Securing reservations for this place was the most difficult (aside from Momofuku ko in NYC, which I have given up on) that I have experienced. Even concierge services have trouble landing a table here. Luckily, thanks to the handy 'redial' button, reservations were made and the simple question was posed. We opted to ""Take the Tour"", which consisted of 24 courses. Yes, t-w-e-n-t-y f-o-u-r. It's pretty intimidating to think about especially if you are worried that you can't finish them (and especially if you were silly enough to eat a pizza pot pie two hours beforehand!). But, no worries, the mission was accomplished. The wine pairings and service at Alinea were quite frankly supurb. The best I've experienced in the U.S. As for the food? It was my best meal ever. Too much to describe, too long of a conversation this would devolve into. The tour included dessert and an assortment of foods prepared in more scientific-inspired styles I could have imaged (freeze dried cheese? gelatinized flavor packed tomato cubs? basil ice cream? Guiness beer gelatin layer?). My favorite dish was the Wagyu beef from Japan pairing with maitake mushrooms and some secret Elixir. Oh yes, the answer to my gf's original question, ""Four hours""."
307,"Plus: Cool experience. Calm minimalist design, a little bare for me but nice all in all Killer, innovative dishes -- obviously Love how they prep the dishes the same even if one's red meat and one's seafood. Great to be able to share the experience... Minus: Over-salted sometimes! What thah... I was hungry after 12 courses...and I'm not big... Some staff have an attitude like you should bow down for the privilege to eat here. Whatever. It was a great meal, but there's no need for pomp."
308,"For her 30th Birthday, I took my girlfriend to Alinea for dinner after a play at Steppenwolf. I was hoping to impress her since I'm of little value otherwise and I think it worked reasonably well. Easily the most incredible service I've ever experienced. They knew what I was thinking and didn't require me to actually say it. I won't bore you with the effusive praise I've been giving this place every time it's come up in the past few months since I went, but let me tell you, it's fantastic. Yeah, they gave us a menu, but I'm not really sure why. I was getting twelve courses, damnit, and every wine on the suggested pairing wine course, to boot. So, of course, we didn't bother looking over the menu as we much prefer to be surprised. The meal was a healthy three and half hours long and while each course was small, it was plenty of food (see: 12 courses above). For me, it was the perfect amount of food and alcohol. I was in a blissed out coma by the end. For my ever so petite girlfriend, I think eight to ten might have worked a little better, but you won't see any complaining from me. It was a truly a memorable that I will never forget. Hopefully she'll remember her 30th birthday and smile and hopefully you can experience it for yourself and offer your own ""condensed"", effusive praise on this very website. Best meal ever."
309,"This is my first EXTREMELY fancy restaurant experience. What can I say other than FOODGASM!!! At first, we felt out of place...we were a younger couple surrounded by a mixed crowd of 40-somes on a double date, a table of young executives buying out the bar, a family of 4 where the parents came saying how they loved it here last time, etc etc. But we felt right at ease when the food arrived and they told us exactly how they wanted to eat it. Hey, we can follow directions :) Every dish was the best dish of my life because of the various tastes, presentations and overall quality. I loved the ideas and creativity behind each dish. Except I hated the beet dish - I can never be friends with a beet and this dish, albeit a wonderfully tender short rib was cooked to perfection underneath it all, was screaming beet flavors. Ewww. I know that I have nothing to compare this to but I'd definitely recommend Alinea to everyone. My ""mass quanitity food only, please"" and ""who cares about presentation and food art"" fiance would, too, and that certainly is an accomplishment for Alinea!"
310,"First things, first - It's stupefyingly expensive. Go on a company's dime (if you can) or save it for that really REALLY special occasion. That said, the experience (as vouched by practically all who've dined there) is stupefyingly phenomenal. It is likely that you will not swear the flavor of every single course is nirvana in tangible earthly form. However, you will always say that the presentation, conception, and delivery of each course is art in its truest form. And I guarantee that you will find - amongst the 12 or 24 courses - dishes that you swear is the work of a culinary prodigy. One of those for the wifey and I was the Lobster of the Winter 08 menu. The inspiration for that dish - as explained to us by one of the extremely capable waitstaff - was brilliant. The flavors on the dish were complex but never clashing. Achatz managed to incorporate multiple different elements that one would not normally use together - curry, lobster, and onion to name a few in this one dish - and bind them together flawlessly. Truly, pure genius. We also really enjoyed the caramel dessert - a perfect example instance where molecular gastronomy is merely the means and never the ends in Achatz's kitchen. Another standout was the Wagyu beef/Miatake mushroom dish. Service can best be described as impeccable. Alinea is the gold standard for dining in Chicago. Don't let the haters and illiterate dissuade you otherwise. I'm sure there will be a pang of regret come the time I open the credit card bill, but for those 3.5 hours we enjoyed our dinner in awe and without regret."
311,"I went here Saturday night for my wedding anniversary. We did the short menu... only like 12 courses (only!). The atmosphere was great.. We walked into a glowingly lit entrance hall, and then the sliding door to the left silently opened to let us in. It was very futuristic. I LOVED the food. Some of it was really good, some of it blew my mind. There was a soup that made me laugh while I was eating it... it was so fun to dig around and try the different tastes, textures and temperatures. We also did the wine pairing, which was wonderful too. The sommelier knew his stuff, and told us the story behind each bottle as he was pouring it (note that this was primarily because we showed interest... i don't get the feeling that he would have forced this on unwilling listeners). My only negative was the price. The short tasting was $145 per person, plus $110 more for wine, and tea & coffee at the end were $6 each. The whole thing, including tax & tip, was about $700 for the two of us. Yeah, $700. I'm not sure anything is worth that. Think about what you can buy for $700. But clearly, people are willing to pay that amount. And it was fabulous stuff, beautifully and whimsically presented without crossing the line to ridiculous (no pop rocks or smashed corn nuts and the use of foams was quite restrained). So... in the end I would say it was one of the best meals of my life, but I'm still struggling with the price. I may go again, but boy, if it were a little less expensive I would go a lot more."
312,"I don't think I can add to the glowing reviews of this dining experience. I would say that I enjoyed 80% of the 24+ courses. The presentation of all the courses was outstanding. The service was excellent. The staff was very friendly and quite down to earth which made the long dining experience not seem as if it was drawn out. This is not an everyday restaurant and many people will struggle with the descriptions on the menu. My suggestions...save your money, get a reservation, don't look at the menu before you go, do the 12 course dinner before you consider doing the 24, do the wine pairings and have a great time."
313,"Words cannot describe the Alinea experience or even remotely do it justice. This was the most intense flavor experience that I've ever had, along with some of the most attentive and nice staff that I have encountered at a restaurant. I'm not sure why I'm going to try, but here we go: We made reservations MONTHS ahead. Yes, this is normal, yes, the restaurant was packed. Yes, they expect you can and will pay out the ass for what will go down as one of the most memorable nights of your life. You will not regret it. You may look at your bill (food+wine) in disbelief, but you won't care. It was 25 courses of amazing food. Culinary genius. You however, will not enjoy this dinner if you are expecting the Olive Garden and never-ending pasta and breadsticks. Some of the flavors are recognizable, some are completely foreign and exotic. You need to be able to embrace it. If you go in thinking you'll love every flavor, you definitely will not. It's about the journey and experiences throughout that make this dinner so amazing. The presentation was flawless, everything perched in its own designated spot. Instructions presented on how to eat certain dishes. Everything has been thought out. There is nothing for you to do other than to sit back and enjoy the ride. Some of my favorite courses were the pork belly spring roll, the tomatoes on the grass scent filled pillow, and the liquid nitrogen frozen chocolate mousse dessert. The dessert was a feat on its own, and they prepared it directly on your table on a silicon mat. I won't ruin it all for you, it's all the small details that will amaze you. The staff was everywhere. This is not necessarily a private dining experience. There were about 2-3 people around our table at all times, either replacing utensils, pouring water that never went below half-full, or giving us another one of our wine flights. If you have a few hundred dollars to spend and you love food and flavors, go for it. There are tons of reviews on here that definitely are compelling and make the case. Go out for a night you will remember for the rest of your life."
314,"On a whim, I made a food field trip to Chicago, and I knew that I had to see what the buzz was all about regarding this restaurant. With my reservation set for a month in advance, I eagerly anticipated the discoveries of a lifetime on my dinner plate. Now that I've been through the tour at Alinea, I can truly say that food is more than just nourishment. It's a way of life that evokes feeling and emotion; to be more specific, true happiness! The experience began as I walked thru the large unmarked wood doors. A long hallway awaited me and mysteriously directed me to the sliding doors of the restaurant. The decor was sleek and very clean. I was greeted by the host and brought up the stairs to a nice corner table where the food experience of a lifetime was to occur. 26 courses and 4 hours later, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Some favorites of mine included a cauliflower puree dish, pumpkin and gruyere cheese custard served a bed of smoke, trout roe with tropical flavors, and a wagyu beef and mushroom dish with a maple infused sherry vinegar. I could go on and on with the food, but to conclude, dinner at Alinea is the experience of a lifetime!"
315,"It's been long enough since we had our memorable dining experience at Alinea. Since I've been traveling I didn't want to just throw thoughts on a page. However, I doubt I can add much to the world of Alinea experiences already well documented. After hearing from everyone else, I discovered for myself why everyone calls Alinea ""an experience."" It's a magic show with food; a cirque du soleil tableside. You might not enjoy the flavors of every course presented (I had a few...), but the experience trumps all. A stop at Alinea is a must for any serious foodie, food lover or people that simply enjoy being wowed. And surprisingly, the value is remarkable. For the amount of time, the number of courses, the quality of service and above all, the quality of the food, you walk out feeling like you got your money's worth. There are more pictures and my review continues at my blog."
316,Most amazing meal ever. PERFECT wine pairings. Impeccable service. 14 courses beyond imagination. I left with a buzz - and mesmerized by what is possible. We flew in to eat here; the meal was more expensive than the flights.
317,"Simply put: the service and food were so amazing at Alinea I didn't minding dropping $500 on the extended menu with wine pairing. I've never said that before (and I will probably never say it again). Alinea is definitely a ""culinary experience"" and not just eating out. They even made some special new dishes just for my wife because she was a vegetarian. All in all, if you can afford it, you should make it a point to visit Alinea. I would say that you can probably just do the shorter menu and still have a great experience but like I said already, I have no regrets about going all the way!"
318,"For me, dining at Alinea is like going to hear Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera. Something I don't need to experience a lot of times or even two perhaps. It is an experience that is unparalleled and unduplicated live and in the moment but not something I crave or want more of at all. The experience at Alinea preys on one of our most basic human weak points: anticipation. After you get surprised (I won't ruin it) the first time, you are constantly looking at the vessels put down in from of you before the actual food comes and you begin to wonder and guess what could be next. That is a unique part of the Alinea experience compared to ANY other place I have ever been to. The dining experience we all know well and can relate to consists of the acts of: seeing food, smelling food and then tasting food. (To Yelpers, there is one more: writing about food :-) SEEING the food here is like no place else. The presentation may seem whimsical but probably could not be more thought out. Every dish is a piece of art unto itself. No two plates were the same and there is a conscious decision for none of them to be even similar. The custom tableware items are essentially ""serving canvases"". They are mediums to help enhance the presentation and are often an integral part of each course. Discussing them in depth here I think would take away part of the experience. Once again, the anticipation was one for the best parts of the meal so I will not go into detail here but I am sure other reviewers have. Just rest assured, you WILL be surprised and you WILL be impressed. The SMELLS of the courses at Alinea were like nowhere else I have ever been. Some of the smells they used did not come from anything that was actually consumed in that particular course. When was the last time or have you ever had someone tell you: ""Here, smell this but you are not eating this. That is just for smell. This part over here, this is for eating.""? You haven't. I haven't and 99.9% of the world hasn't. It's because it doesn't make any sense to us and we have never been forced to consider it...until a place like this comes along and shows you what the experience can be like. You will TASTE things here that you have never tasted before and you will taste things here in ways that you have never tasted them before. They are not traditionally slow cooking and developing flavors here. The chef has very specific tastes that he is trying to impart on the diners. Most of these tastes and some of these flavors, I have never experienced. Every dish had multiple components. Some worked. Some didn't. Some had very specific instructions on how to eat them, others were specific that there weren't any instructions on how to eat them, which actually made those instructions specific. After most courses, we shook are head in agreement that there was ""a lot going on there"" or ""that was good"" but few courses left us wanting more of any particular dish even though some were only one bite. As far as a ""Dining Experience"" goes, Alinea is tops. If this where food is heading, it will be an interesting ride but part of the a conversation that we had was that this is the ULTIMATE gluttonous and selfish experience. You are not coming here because you are hungry, you are coming here because you want to be surprised, pleased & entertained. It gives new meaning to ""Dinner Theater"" . It is worth noting that while the service was impeccable and I do mean IMPECCABLE, there is a distinct lack of warmness and personal experience that you get at other similar caliber restaurants (Le Bernadin & Daniel). We left realizing that no one ever asked us ONE question about ourselves besides ""Do you have any allergies?"". When have you ever been anywhere and them not ask you where you were from or if you were celebrating anything, etc... As much as Alinea exploits our basic weakness for anticipation, it neglects our more basic need to feel like we belong, are liked or are important. None of which is the responsibility of a restaurant but why bother trying so hard with EVERYTHING ELSE just to let this not even be considered. Once again, you eat here for the experience. Having the diner feel like you actually care about them and their experience (which you are creating) is just as important as anything else. When you spend $700 on dinner, I don't care who you are, you wouldn't mind someone asking your name. There is an incredible amount of time and effort that goes into every presentation here and that alone is worth the price of admission. However, for me, ""Best Restaurant in America"", is somewhere I would want to eat in again. This is not it."
319,"Alinea is my first experience on molecular gastronomy. I have to be honest and say that I had low expectations with this type of cuisine since, it's kinda 'freaky' and I thought it was just some commercial invention intended to suck us dry. But I gave Alinea a try after the eventful events I read about Grant Achatz and because this is the top rated Chicago restaurant in Yelp. And boy I was blown away. As expected, there are a lot of unique stuff about the food here that you probably haven't tasted before, unless you've done molecular gastronomy before. All the dishes deliver one way or the other and they were surprisingly very flavorful and on the heavier side, which is fortunately very much to my preference. My favorite would probably be the cauliflower dish. They pureed & cubed it and coated it with 5 different things. I can't remember them now but bacon was one of them. The pork belly with cooked in coconut milk was fantastic too. It wasn't too fanciful and was one of the simpler dish but it was cooked to absolute perfection. One little complain that I concerns the service. Now, the service was very good but I just felt frustrated of the difference in treatment that the other party at the end of the room got. (When I reached the 3rd/4th course, there were only 2 parties in that room). Alinea offers 2 kinds of menu, the tasting (shorter) and the tour (longer); we ordered the tasting and I am 100% sure so did the other party. First, we were not offered a couple of dishes that the other parties were offered. To my anguish, the dish was foei gras and the other one was some candy dessert that I honestly didn't care about. (I'm not a dessert man). When I asked them for an explanation, they gave a very unsatisfactory answer that ""the chef cooked different meals for different tables"" which actually further proved that we were treated differently. Maybe if we had some dishes that the other party did not have, I'd have understand. Secondly, the servant who described their food to them do it in much detail and was definitely someone senior (Had the suit, tie and all that) but the one who described it to us was, how should I say, some random dude. It was not as if there were no other 'senior' waiters available. In fact, as I mentioned, most of them had nothing to do as the restaurants were kinda quiet when we dined. He was also very short in his description and I had to ask him some questions in order to get the full description of the meal. My and my girlfriends are Chinese, and we are young; now I know that there are some stereotypes that may be Asians are cheapskates and young ones wouldn't understand 'complex' food anyway and I can accept that anywhere else but not in a restaurant like Alinea. I DO understand those foods and I expect those guys to explain it fully to me. But after all that, I would still give them 5 stars. Their service was still very good and polite and as hard as it is to accept, I am a supporter of preferential treatment as well. In a business, obviously you'd treat your regular customer differently but damn, it kinda sucked being on the receiving end and this was my first experience."
320,"I, too, can now check off one of Chicago's fanciest/most expensive/hyped restaurants. My verdict: lots of flavors and highly inventive. Most theatrical dish: the nutmeg dessert pillow that deflated and left aromas of nutmeg in the air. I probably won't be back, but it was quite the experience."
321,Worth the special arrangements. The staff are incredibly knowledgable about the impeccable and unique menu. It has all been said and you should believe every word.
322,"As everyone else has already said, the food here is amazing. The atmosphere, is not quite my style - although much to be expected given all the previous reviews. There are a couple things I would change if I were to ever have the pleasure to visit again - skip the 12 course tasting and go for the 24 course tasting. I was practically drooling over the group next to us as they were getting 2 courses for every 1 course we received - skip the wine pairings. Alinea food is better if you're not wasted by the end of your tour -please don't yell at me for putting my silverware in the wrong place - you served me all that wine in the first place For the money, I would go to Schwa every time. I wouldn't, however pass up a trip back if someone else were paying..."
323,"Like the other hundreds of reviewers, i too thought this restaurant was in a league of its own. It is a very different experience than a french laundry or per se given it is gastronomy but eat here once before you die or multiple if you are so lucky. It is truly differentiated in its service, food and creativity, Grant Achatz is one extremely gifted chef and a thought leader in a the arena of food worldwide. The only thing i will tell you about the food is that no matter what sample menu you see on websites or elsewhere, nothing tastes like it sounds, everything is an elaborate experience. They have also customized all their plates and cutlery to be fitted for all that they do. Call exactly 2 months before when they start taking reservations and get one at 6pm because you aren't going to leave before 9pm. If you have dietary restrictions, TELL THEM. They are very good about customizing your menu but you really do need to tell them in advance. Each dish is small so you will leave feeling satisfied without being stuffed, they have perfected this in a way i have seen no one else do. They will give you a copy of the menu when you leave with all that you ate. Service: they section off the restaurant so wait staffs of 8 (maybe less) are only serving 4 tables at once. What this translates to is impeccable service. It is slightly creepy because there is always someone in the room if not 2-3 people so as soon as you are done with a dish, it is off your table before you know it. They also fill water so fast that my water glass never actually got below full. They clean the bathroom after each use. You are not allowed to use flash photography, i found this out by embarrassing myself so please don't do that. The servers are very quiet, they stare at you so you are not alone and you are aware of that but if you try to make conversation i found them to be pretty straight forward, they answer then disappear. I suppose that is just part of the experience where the focus is the food. I could tell you all that i ate but it is very difficult to explain in words so instead i'm uploading the pics i took and you can look at them which i is actually a much better way to try and understand what you'll be eating. Basically you taste things you never thought should go together and flavors you have never had before. The best part was dessert where Achatz came out and did the dessert creation on our table, there are many videos of this on youtube but it was really cool to see in person. Go to this restaurant, it is a foodie's dream."
324,"Alinea is simply...Devine! In Oct '08, my girlfriend and I planned a trip to Chicago for a girls only foodie weekend. Alinea was definitely at the top of our list and quite honestly, the main reason for our adventure. For several years, the two of us have been talking about Chef Grant Achatz as if he was the second coming--so I have to admit, I was a little afraid that after all the hoopla we created in our minds, we would be terribly disappointed with the whole experience. Thankfully - this was not the case. Our visit to Alinea definitely ended up being a unique dining experience and one that I will share with anyone willing to listen. I would honestly dine here regularly if I lived nearby...monthly perhaps ...and you laugh? I'm dead serious! From the moment you enter the door, you are greeted by a narrowing hallway that seems to be a dead-end. For a split second, you stand there wondering where to go next and then a sliding door magically opens up into the restaurant. Sweet...nice touch Chef Achatz!! You are immediately whisked away to where you will spend the rest of the evening on the edge of your seat. We unfortunately went with the tasting menu instead of the full but nevertheless, it was again..the best dining experience one could ever have. With every single item that came to our table, it continued to take the dinner to a whole new level. Each time, it just blew us away. We were so pleased with everything. I took 40 or so pictures and was bummed to discover that I left my camera in the cab. boo hooo... I vowed to make reservations at the restaurant every single time I'm in Chicago. It's worth the money, worth the time..and perhaps some will agree; Chef Achatz is the second coming after all."
325,"Fun food that tickles the senses. The quality of the experience thankfully eclipsed the drunk old woman first teetering in the hallway, then yakking in the Alinea bathroom, when I first arrived. The moral of the story is not to drink the wine flight unless you can hold your liquor better than an Irish frat boy. Otherwise, you might not remember the tasty, and really pricey, meal."
326,"I planned a trip to Chicago around a visit to Alinea. Extreme? No. Dining experiences are remarkably memorable, especially when the company and conversations are exceptional. Conversations spiced with delectable and creative flavour combinations are even more memorable. The Tour menu our party selected held 26 courses. We took the suggested wine pairing (and another bottle of Kosta Browne Pinot Noir 2005, despite a subtle disapproval from the sommelier) and set out to enjoy every tiny morsel. Except that 26 small portions turn out to a rather hefty meal. It takes discipline to taste every flavour in turn, especially while trying equally hard to savour the flavours of the paired wines and of course their interaction on the palate. It's hard to say whether I was successful, but it was a marvel of pairing creativity. It's intriguing to me how much asian cuisine is pulled into the repertoire of the Chef's imagination -- but clear Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese influences are present along with more N. American culinary heritages from Italy, France, Britain and the like. (Earl Grey was used in the dessert, so... back off!) While I can't say that I was ecstatic during every course, I can say I was ecstatic for many of them. Not every combination worked perfectly to my tongue - but that doesn't detract from my sense of amazement at the detail and courage it takes to decide to create a tasting menu of such breadth and depth. Intimate seating, and elegant, visually soothing, non-distracting decor assures the patron that their attention will be focused on the food. Honestly, it's so very worth paying attention. 5 out of 5."
327,"One day my boyfriend came up to me and said that he want to go eat at Alinea when his friends visited in Chicago. I had never heard of Alinea nor Chef Grant at that time, so I was not that excited about going to a high priced restaurant like Alinea to eat plates with a bite or two of food. At the same time, I was very excited to dress up and eating at the number one restaurant in North America with the man that I love. Before Alinea, I rated most places a 4 or 5, but Alinea changed my mind on what it means to be a 5 star restaurant. Alinea was the most amazing dining experience. The amazing experience began the moment we walked up to the restaurant. We were greeted by name and was seated at a large black table with plenty of leg and arm room. We had two servers to wait on us. The restaurant is divided into sections with around six tables in each section. It appeared like each section had two main servers. In other words, you will be well taken care of. They will provide you will just about anything you may need, including aspirin. They pulled the chair out everytime we went to the bathroom and was ready to seat us as we walked to the table from the bathroom. I tried one time to get up without their help. I think it is impossible. The food was the most amazing food I had ever put into my mouth. We got the 28-course dinner that took us around 6 hours to eat. Oh my goodness, that was mind blowing. I don't want to tell you all the courses, because that may destroy the experience that you could have on your visit. I will tell you that Alinea does not serve a specific kind of food. I was asked by friends and family, ""What kind of food does Alinea serve?"" Well, Alinea isn't American, French, Indian, Mexican or any other nationality of food. It is just Alinean food. Every dish uses texture, smell, taste and sight to explode your mind with pleasure. The dessert was even more special. Chef Grant and an assistant personal made the dessert right there at our table. I may not be the biggest foodie out there, but I became a real food critic after experiencing the best food in Chicago and maybe in the world. Go to Alinea and have your best food experience. It is completely worth it."
328,"Alinea is definitely a unique dinning experience, to say the least. Once you walk through the electric sliding door be prepared to empty out your pockets and loosen up your belt. Although the portions may be smaller to what Joe Simpleton is accustomed to, their steady accumulation is liable to make your stomach wonder if you are a glutton for punishment, especially if you had a late lunch, so make sure you come hungry! My party and I went with the 12 course and wine pairing route, plus a few other bites here and there. The most memorable dishes for me were the Wagyu Beef with maitake, smoked date and ""Blis Elixir"", which literally melted in my mouth, and the Short Rib with Guinness, peanut and Fried broccoli, which is a bit like a gourmet version of a Beef and Broccoli dish from your local chinese joint. The two dishes that were the least pleasing to me were the ones that contained chocolate. The first being the Duck, Chocolate, Blueberry and Thai Pepper and the second being the Chocolate, Blueberry, hazelnut, and Thai Pepper. Yes you read that correctly, duck and chocolate, but not the chocolate you are thinking of, this is purely unsweetened chocolate, the kind that leaves a really sour taste in your mouth. This sourness really made it hard to enjoy or even taste the rest of the ingredients in this dish. For dessert, we were served a variation on the same theme but with hazelnut replacing the duck and chocolate that's sweetened. Although creative and artsy this dessert really lacked the oomph that makes a meal go out with a bang. Overall my experience at Alinea was quite pleasant. While I may be apprehensive to blow another $400+ there again soon, I would recommend this place to people purely for the dinning experience, somewhere one should at least try once in their life."
329,"Meh... nothing WOWed me in terms of my taste experience, however, the integrity of each dish were highly presented in an extreme creative approach from ground up which was memorable. The overall decor should be as creative as each dish. Service were decent but not the greatest. Overpriced & Overrated."
330,"It's been said before, and it will be said again, dinner at Alinea was the best dining experience of my life. While I didn't love everything I put in my mouth, every dish was a culinary adventure that I will not soon forget. The atmosphere at Alinea is simple and calming, but dare I say, the best part about Alinea was the absolutely impeccable service by the friendly, charming, down to earth waiters. There are neither enough stars nor enough dollar signs to describe Alinea, and anyone who has the opportunity to indulge themselves here should. Thanks Mom!"
331,"Amazing. Innovative and fun! The service was impeccable. At the end of the night, they offered me a pashmina wrap when I was feeling chilly! I really enjoyed the down to earth attitude of the waitstaff. I've been to all the other top restaurants in Chicago, and received the best service here by far. The food was great- very different. I felt quite full once we got to the 17th course, but luckily my date finished it for me! The wine offering is extensive as well. We had a 1988 Echezeaux and a 2003 Puligny-Montrachet Cru which was AMAZING. I loved the atmosphere too. Very ""Inspector Gadget"". If you have VIP clients to entertain, or something big to celebrate, I highly recommend!"
332,"242nd review. Here's my 2 cents. I was lucky enough to get to experience Alinea this week. This is a culinary experience. It is not for the faint of heart. Did the 12-course (ended up being about 14 courses)+ wine pairings. I was worried it would be too much alcohol, but it was perfect. (It's actually about 8 pairings). The smaller tasting is plenty of food. I was stuffed, especially with all the bread they bring you - maybe 4 pieces? I was turning the guy away. Enough starch! I want more room for the actual courses. The service is impeccable - light-hearted but informative. Couple next to us was tanked... makes me wonder why you would do that before experiencing such a fabulous meal? Oh well, made for good entertainment."
333,"Aside from my old and dear friend's wedding, Alinea was the main purpose we recently traveled to Chicago. (Well, that and Hot Doug's.) I suppose that was the problem: with that kind of expectation, I'm not sure any restaurant could lived up. I should have known better. I should not have expected the culinary equivalent of David Blaine, to be wowed to the point of incredulity. How did they DO that? Instead, what we had was a well executed, if slightly overfilling, 12-course meal of haute cuisine. There certainly were soaring high points (the wagyu beef was not only a fantastic cut but also perfectly prepared; the reduction infused with thai flavors was almost Blaine-ish in its magic). There were lows (the crack pipe-like glass cylinder filled with desserts just didn't do it, nor did the gooey cube of potato). The staff were expert, if not slightly odd at times, and the atmosphere was excellent. I do feel the wine pairings were not worth the expense, I should have trusted myself to go off the list instead. All in all, I think Alinea was worth the experience, but I don't think the experience transcended the sum of its parts. I wish I could have had larger portions of a few of the dishes, rather than the smaller portions of many dishes, but that is the risk of the tasting menu. That said, nothing anyone could have said on Yelp would have stopped me from going, that's how curious I was, so if you are like me, you'll go, just temper your expectations!"
334,"This was the most amazing dinner experience I have ever had. I am not going to say it was my favorite meal, but that is not why I was there. Alinea offers something that few other places could even imagine. Every course is a study in flavor, temperature, and texture. The combinations are brilliantly creative and it may have been the most fun I have had at any restaurant. Each dish seemed to be more amazing than the last and by the end, I was sad it was over. I also had the best wine I have ever tasted, but will probably never taste it again. Alinea lives up to its expectations and possibly even exceeds them. It is a wonderfully designed restaurant with a great staff and they offer an amazing vision of what food is."
335,"If your are going to Alinea you are probably a foodie but I'll say it anyway that you are in for a multi-course evening that will take several hours and be composed of many small dishes. This restaurant is for serious restaurant-lovers and you are going to spend a lot of money there so my suggestion is to dive in to the deep end of the pool and get the wine pairing because it is worth doing at a place like this. Usually when my wife and I go to dinner we choose a cuisine (Asian, Greek, French) or focus on a food (duck, fish, steak) and then select an old favorite restaurant or choose a new place that we have heard of. Alinea chooses to look at food and restaurants differently. Their kitchen does not have traditional stations, there is no line, the food tickets are held in the front and called out by a maestro like figure who orchestrates a team of over 24 cooks. The restaurant like Charlie Trotters, Les Nomades and other boutique restaurants is located a converted brownstone just north of the Steppenwolf Theater on Halsted and is modern with glass staircases, original modern art and has a minimalist but warm feel. Alinea is truly different however in its approach to the food. The menu you will be served is fixed, so aside from any food allergies you won't be choosing anything and the focus of each plate served to you is not a cuisine or a product but a flavor. You then add to the flavor by mixing the main item with side items & sauces which change that base flavor and make your plate different from anyone else who had it before. For example the Ice Fish course had segments of the fish placed along a line of vegetables and sauces including horseradish and other complementary flavors that you mix together in different combinations which creates more unique flavors. In some dishes instead of you changing he flavors they change them around for you by having ingredients mix together like the Apple Cider ""shot"" which came in a glass where the cider was trapped inside a nickel sized ball made of cinnamon flavored skin and was floating in walnut milk. You tipped the shot back and the ball burst in your mouth mixing the cider and walnut milk with the cinnamon. All the dishes were this way often forcing opposites together like sweet and salty, milky and crunchy etc. Overall I give Alinea five stars because it is truly unique and recognized world wide for what it is. However I would say these types of preparations are a bit of a schtick that for some people may get old by the 16th or 20th course. Having said that, this is truly a professional kitchen doing things you can't do at home which is why people should go out. This group of young people are definitely serious and will go on to do great things themselves. Summary: Each plate was an artist's palette that needs you to complete it but if you go there you have to approach it not as going out for a type of food or a single item but that you are going out to experience what a talented group of chefs can do with flavors."
336,"Clearly, Alinea is a place familiar to many not only in Chicago, but all over the US. I am here to not speak about the food in particular, but to really share my ""experience"". I find it hard to categorize Alinea as just an upscale restaurant because it is so much more than that. Even to just say that it is an ""experience"" kind of diminishes what Grant Achatz and his team are trying to do here. I've read the reviews and realize that when people complain about the price charged and questions about the worth.....I feel that those individuals just don't get what Alinea's purpose is. My dining experience at Alinea really made an impact on my view of food. Food is a necessity for all living beings, but Alinea took that necessity to a whole other level for us humans......there were textures, flavors, fragrances, sights and smells that I have never experienced before. It was not about just filling my stomach with delicious, high quality food (of which they definitely did), but more of a place to discover that my palate consisted of more than just limiting myself to taste sweet, salt, bitter, etc...... I walked in with an ignorant palate and walked out a graduate of true flavor and taste. Thank you, Alinea!"
337,"Went there on my birthday last year. Amazing experience....and the only reason why it is getting a 4 star instead of 5 is because it is currently not one of my top 3 restaurants. The presentation was amazing and the food was refreshing, innovating and extravagant. The wine pairing was generous and diverse. But some of the dishes's taste did not match how it looks, I remember one dish being extremely salty and it numbed my taste bud. but other than that, I love everything about the place and can't wait to go back again!"
338,"It's hard to expect anything less than earth shaking from a restaurant that was dubbed with the ""#1 ranking"" from Gourmet Magazine's ""Top 50 Restaurants."" Not once but twice. The venue is sophisticated yet humbly understated; a blank canvas for the artistic creations that will hit your table like a spray from Jackson Pollock's paintbrush. Each dish is carefully constructed, using both rare and familiar ingredients, which all equally create a complex, gastronomic dance, on the palate. In a nut shell: It's a culinary experience one should have at least once in their lifetime!"
339,"This is not somewhere you just go for dinner. Alinea offers an unforgettable experience that is more like going to a culinary theater. Dinner was 4 hours long. We had 25 courses which included oxtail, halibut, cotton candy, and sorbet (like Dippin' Dots but in unique flavors like mango and cayenne pepper that melt in your mouth - they made you guess what the 7 different flavors were). All the dishes were presented in some unique apparatus. There was a bacon dish where the bacon hung like a hammock. There was a bubblegum flavored syrup that you drank out of a giant test tube. Each course had a unique twist that you can't find anywhere else. The atmosphere and the service were also excellent. They also offer wine pairings with each course. The only downside is that it's really expensive (as other reviewers mentioned). The ""tour"" which is 25 courses is $225 (plus wine, tax, tip) while the ""tasting"" is 12 courses for $145. Also, I made the reservations two months in advance. We all thought it was worth it (and I'm not just saying that cause I feel stupid having spent that much on dinner!)."
340,"THE FOOD: In a word: spectacular. I didn't love everything equally, but I did enjoy every bite, and at least half of them were so intensely flavorful, complex and well balanced that I had to close my eyes and take a moment to process the experience fully. I've had a handful of culinary moments like that in my life, but never so many at one meal. There were no mistakes, missteps, under/over cooked ingredients, under/over seasoned dishes, etc. At this price level, I expect a lot of attention to detail, and sadly, I'm often disappointed; but not here. Everything was implemented perfectly (from my subjective point of view). In fact, the food was so good, I am inspired to spend time and energy cooking from the Alinea cookbook. Even though many of the recipes are beyond fussy, I want to try because it's fun. Yes, you can have fun with your food, and you don't have to throw it in order to do so. THE SERVICE: The servers cooperate, so we didn't have just one. That was nice because we were never feeling like we were ""waiting"" for our ""waiter"", so to speak. Everyone was polite, friendly and relaxed; but they were all focused and busy. I loved the service here. Alhough they were attentive to our needs, they were never intrusive. Because of the cooperating arrangement between the servers, perhaps the overall impression was a bit ""cold"" compared to your typical family style restaurant. Even so, it was MUCH more relaxed and anjoyable than the usual stuffy, pretentious ""high-end"" european-style dining room. THE ATMOSPHERE: The environment is hyper-modern, in a MOMA kind of way, which can be good or bad depending on your preference. To me, the setting fit the contemporary nature of the menu, but I would have liked more light on the food so I could better appreciate its visual appeal. The dining rooms are separated so that each one only has a few tables, which makes for an intimate environment. The chairs are comfy and the table is very stable. They took care to craft each part of the environment in such a way as to enable diners to focus on enjoying the food without being distracted by anything else. THE COST: The comment I get most when I tell people I ate here is, holy crap, that's an expensive meal; was the food made of gold or something? But to me it was worth it. If you consider that I had 20 courses served over 4 hours, and you consider how much effort (and premium ingredient) went into those courses, then the whole experience begins to feel more like dinner theater, but in a way that engages all of my senses. I haven't eaten at many restaurants in this price range, so i can't comment on what this price can get you elsewhere. But it's hard to imagine getting more variety of better quality. Maybe you can and I just don't know it. OVERALL: If I could give it 6 stars, I would. I have rated far lesser places 5 stars; since there is only a single rating to cover the entire experience, it's really about overall value. Despite not being wealthy, my wife and I plan to return to Chicago next summer just to eat here. Of course we will find other fun things to do too, but revisiting Alinea is our real reason for coming back to Chicago."
341,"Dined here on 12/5/2010. The meal, the experience, the evening was nothing short of amazing. When I first read about Alinea so long ago they offered two fixed menus, and even recently in reading reviews I have seen people mention a smaller course menu. Perhaps if we had asked about it it would have been an option but it was not mentioned. If I had to guess, they do not offer two menus any longer. No need to go over anything else. If you have the money, the time, and the forethought to reserve a table, you won't regret it. Some others have mentioned that this is an experience and comparable (monetarily) to other forms of entertainment or a night out. Whatever you need to do to justify the expenditure, do it, it's worth it!"
342,"We went here on our last trip to attend our daughter's graduation and obviously went in with high expectations -- in terms of inventiveness, those expectations were met, but in terms of food, there was a great deal of inconsistency. It was a culinary experience, but I found some of the selections were more gimmicky than anything else (for example, the leaf that was supposed to taste like an oyster etc..). Most disappointing was the chocolate desert which was more of a show which I got bored after a few scoops. All in all, my suggestion for a better meal in Chicago would be Sprout for a true tasty dinner."
343,"I'd probably give this a 4-star rating, if not for the fact that it's a $500 meal after wine and should have absolutely knocked my socks off in the same way other meals of that caliber have. I went in with high expectations -- in terms of inventiveness, those expectations were met, but in terms of food, there was a great deal of inconsistency. The mushroom dish, the brook trout and the sea bream (for which he ventured away from modern cuisine) were all excellent dishes. The rest was merely overwrought and engineered for engineering sake, often at the cost of flavor. For example, the scallop acting as agedashi tofu was a perfect success in what the chef had sought out to do, specifically that a scallop had been robbed of its texture and flavor and rendered into a non-vegetarian imitation of tofu (though the table-brewed broth was very nice). The yuba, while relatively well-flavored and craftily served, was not up to the standards I would expect for such a meal. Hot potato, cold potato was overwhelmed by truffle in a way that so many chefs feel the need to do with truffle dishes. The venison, let's face it, is basically a game-meat version of a lettuce wrap with just a fancy rack. The first dessert had okay flavors, but most seemed to have been lost in the cubism. The final dessert -- a dark chocolate ""pinata"" filled with liquid nitrogen frozen pumpkin pie, fluff, and meringues -- was the final in spectacular presentation with too little flavor; not even the dark chocolate shell offered much for the taste buds. The wine pairings were good but not superb. The ambiance was inappropriate for a culinary experience like no other. We were seated at a very strange table -- over-sized for two to sit across from each other, but not appropriate for two to sit at one corner due to its banquette location. The lighting was over-bright, which was surprising given the entrance and foyer lighting was quite the opposite. Generally speaking, I'm not sure that I would ever consider using the downstairs front dining room as a dining room except for private functions. The service staff was aloof and haughty, and not in the way one would expect for a world class restaurant -- and certainly not in the way one would expect for an innovative restaurant. All in all, my suggestion for a far better meal in Chicago would be L2O for a 10 or 12 course tasting, though I understand they lost their founding chef. If you'd like to see some spectacular presentations along with your meal, maybe take in a chemistry show beforehand."
344,Go there for the experience. The food is legit. parking is hard to find around the area so just valet it. Go with a bunch of friends because your there for .....4 hours? I had to refill my meter in the middle of dinner because I didnt know tehre was a valet.
345,"Alinea is truly an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Service is impeccable. Decor is simple yet intimate. Not a big restaurant which I think is important to not overcrowd so you can enjoy the experience. Went with my boyfriend at the time 2 years ago. We got the 24-course tasting menu with wine pairing for both of us, which I do NOT recommend. 2 wine pairings are a bit too much because we both got pretty drunk towards the end.. haha. Also not recommended to help your boyfriend finish some of his drinks. So for couples, I recommend just getting 1 wine pairing for 2 people. For each and every dish, the thought and creativity can not only be tasted, but also seen visually and experienced by all the senses possible (e.g. lavender ""smoke"" pillow that sprays out smoke while you're eating a certain dish, the dessert that doesn't require hands). I will upload a picture of my menu when I have access to a scanner.. but definitely go for the 24-course tasting menu after you get off the wait-list to Alinea. As I said before - a once-in-a-lifetime experience that you will NOT want to miss. Hopefully I'll be able to go again next time I'm in Chicago!"
346,"The Skinny: on the cutting edge of innovation, this place deserves it's accolades (5), service is profession if not a little bit anal (5), value - well, we travelled across the country to get here... and it reigns as one of the most memorable dining experiences we've ever had... well worth the plane ticket, hotel and the cost of the prix fixe (5). My hubby has been harping about going here for the longest time and finally we were able to fit this into both of our schedules. We had poured over pictures of his ""coffeetable"" cookbook (bible more like! and really, not a cookbook for home chefs... like who has liquid nitrogen at home?) and were really psyched about coming here. It was well worth the travel and wait. I think the thing that really sold us was Chef Achatz's versatility. I mean, really, we expected all this crazy stuff coming (hot potato/cold potato, that truffle in a ravioli... OMG! so good) out of the kitchen but then he all the sudden surprises us with a delicious squab/foie gras on puff pastry dish that certainly displays pure, traditional French technique. My hubby and I have that dish totally ingrained in our memory. The way that this restaurant differs from some of the other molecular gastronomy places is the balance of techniques. You need a balance of the old and the new - otherwise it's just some gimmicky thing that will be passe with differing food trends (like foam). The chef definitely uses his art judiciously to enhance his raw materials - not to overwhelm them. Finally, the service. Okay, I was a little perturbed that my flash went off a couple times by accident and the camera nazi quickly reminded me that we weren't allowed to use flash (like instanteously). However, despite all of this, the service was quiet, attentive and professional. Our server was a little stoic but definitely acted like he knew what we were eating. When my husband got a little dribble on his shirt, the server rapidly and discreetly handed him a small packet of Shout wipes to help get out the stain. Really great service! The actual icing on the cake was when Chef Achatz came out himself and served the final dessert course. Of course, he didn't talk much other than to explain the dish. He looked kind of gaunt and tired which is probably in light of his medical condition. We really appreciated the gesture of him taking the time out of his busy day to serve us the most memorable part of the meal. For that we are truly grateful!"
347,"Straight to the point, AMAZING!!! Went here the day after I got married (June 13, 2010) and was just blown away with the service, food, and attention to detail! Wish I could give them 10 stars. It's worth the money you spend. I would absolutely go back! My husband and I did the tasting menu and wine pairing. It was just the right amount of food and the wine was paired perfectly with the food! Can't wait for my one year anniversary to return!"
348,"BEST. MEAL. EVER. We made reservations 3 months ago. I saw how much it was going to cost, and it was going to be more than any meal I had ever eaten in my life. And I had heard amazing things from everyone who had been here before me. My expectations could NOT have been higher, and I'm VERY happy to say that I walked out even more satisfied than I could have imagined. Every dish was imaginative and creative, all featuring different ingredients -- very few of the components of the 20 dishes were repeats -- and a wide variety of preparations. Many of the dishes had a whimsical feel to them, and the food runners all had a light sense of humor that kept the meal from being too stuffy, which you would expect from a place this fancy (JACKETS REQUIRED!!). Only our sommelier was a bit too serious, but I guess that was understandable. As an example of the whimsy, there was a big pumpkin sitting at our table when we got there. When we were ready to start our meal, it looked like the waiter was taking the pumpkin off the table to make room for food, but when he lifted the pumpkin, there were four little squares of the most delicious pumpkin cake that I had ever had, with a bit of Thai chili for kick -- great way to start off our meal. That was followed my more and more delicious dishes, and there wasn't a clunker in the whole menu of 20 dishes! My favorites were a razor clam appetizer with XO sauce, the mushrooms with red wine sauce (probably the best mushrooms I've ever had), a Sicilian ""swordfish wheel,"" and the famous ""Hot Potato, Cold Potato"" and black truffle explosion. Some dishes were small, some were larger, but the meal had so many of the best bites of food I've ever eaten before. The meal ended as uniquely as it started. The waiters came out and put a fancy, rubbery tablecloth on our wood table. Then, two chefs came out with two coconut-sized spheres (made of chocolate) and steaming, halloween-like steins (filled with liquid nitrogen). The two chefs poured the liquid nitrogen into the balls, and then followed that by covering the table with some mind-blowing fall-themed sauces -- a lingonberry sauce, a butternut squash syrup, and stout (or porter) reduction. The chefs then picked up the balls and dropped them on the table, chocolate bits and random stuff inside the balls flying everywhere on the table. It was like a frozen pinata, full of little treats like frozen french toast squares, nutmeg cotton candy, meringues, frozen cream cheese bits, and some other interesting, delicious bites that we dipped in all of the sauces. We ate it all right off the table, mostly with our hands. The meal took four and a half hours, but felt perfectly paced with impeccable service. We got the menus at the end, but I've debated many times whether I liked seeing the menu at the end, or whether I would've liked to have known what was coming. We had heard that there were 24 courses so we kept counting them, and didn't really know how many more savory dishes were coming before desserts. Only two drawbacks on the night: (1) they don't have a full bar, so you can't have a cocktail before or during your meal, especially considering all of the amazing cocktails I've heard are served at Aviary; and (2) the wine pairing was a ridiculous $260 per person, which was even more than the meal. While I love wine, I can't justify paying that much for a wine pairing, especially when the meal is already expensive. We did, however, enjoy two delicious bottles of red wine that the sommelier helped us pick out. I cannot recommend Alinea highly enough for a once-in-a-lifetime meal and overall experience."
349,"Want a once-in-a-life-time dining experience at an ""undisclosed"" location? I don't want to sound like a cheesy commercial ad, but Alinea blew us away. The entire culinary experience was perfect. I'm sure Alinea changes their menu from time to time and I can tell you what we had on the evening of January 27th to celebrate our love of food but why ruin the surprise? You get a menu with a list of all the artistic expression of Grant Achatz (head chef) and his team at the end of your meal. If you do the wine paring, which is wonderful, be prepared to shell out the big bucks. The paring will cost you 2/3 of the meal, which might be something to think about."
350,"This was my post marathon meal . We actually came to Chicago just to eat here and then I found out the Marathon was being held that weekend...so I had to do it. We did the full tour, 24 courses that night, along with wine pairings. Our reservation was for 9:30 so we didn't get out of there until about 1:30...ALMOST as long as my marathon :0) All of the food was amazing, flavours, colours, presentations...all top notch. It is hard to describe such a dining experience. Everything was creative, flavourful and we found ourselves dissecting everything then trying it all together just to add to the sensory overload. Creative, fun, interesting and some just kinda bizarre...but it all worked. Grant is a genius. We'll probably be back next time we visit the windy city."
351,"not going to ramble on and on about how this is an experience and life changing. a few notes on things others havent talked about. When you make your reservation they ask if you have any diet restrictions, vegetarian, vegan, no eggs, no milk, allergies, whatever diet you are currently following. I opted for the standard vegetarian and the wild part, every dish that was served to my brother (22 in all) mine looked exactly the same yet made veggie. It was incredible the length chef Achatz and his crew go to ensure every patron is blown away. Also for the non-alcohol drinkers, they have a house made soda progression to go alone with your meal. do it. this place is insane. imagination gone wild. I filmed my meal including the epic dessert being made directly on our table. youve never seen anything like it. http://vimeo.com/22749603"
352,What a fantastic place; my money was extremely well spent. The ingenuity that went into creating these unique dishes is mind blowing. They incorporate aromas so well; I personally thought the nutmeg pillow was very creative. The ambience is relaxing; allowing you to truly savor the food you are being served. Did I say the food you are being served? I meant the art you are being served. I can't wait for another opportunity to dine at Alinea.
353,"Ridiculously expensive, and worth the price of admission. The only complaint was the stuffy head waitress who's sole goal it seems is to dampen the mood in the dining area."
354,"Ok. Here we go. I went to Alinea last night for my birthday with my wife and two friends. Being the food crazed person I am, I have read much about this restaurant and have wanted to dine here since we went to MOTO last year. I'm breaking my opinion down into categories. What we ordered: Tasting (12 courses) and the wine paring. Atmosphere: Neat entrance (field of view / perspective is deceiving and very cool). Dcor was ok (I was downstairs) - kind of plain /simple. There was nothing notable to me other than the amazing view of the kitchen when you walk in. Service: I thought the service was good- though I was a felt like they rushed through the descriptions of the food. I didn't hear about half of what I was eating or the story behind it. This is what we really liked about MOTO- the story behind the dishes was almost as interesting as eating it. The wine descriptions were much better. Food: Some hits, some misses. Overall, the food was good - but much more uninspired than MOTO. It felt like they were using a lot of the same themes (I counted 3 plays on hot and cold). There were two ""wow"" dishes- but I expected more in the 12 courses. I love the experimental food- but this just didn't live up to the hype. Presentation: Beautiful. Even as an industrial designer I was even a bit wowed by the use unique serving pieces. Wine: Absolutely incredible. This was the savior for me- the wine pairing and choices were amazing. Some of the best wines from unexpected places I have ever had. Overall: I would probably not go back. It was good, but for experimental cuisine in Chicago- MOTO reins supreme."
355,"Alinea - my dining experience was like watching a dramatic theater show and left me feeling a wide range of emotions. Excited, Anxious, Happy, Sad, Confused, Giddy, Disappointed (but not what you think though), Surprised, and in the end had me Raving about Alinea and wanting an encore - I actually went to bed smiling. I'm not going to detail every course because I'd be repeating other reviews, but will comment on one dish : Canard a la cussy, which is a puff pastry w/ duck breast, cockscomb. This dish was one of my favorites and least expected... because it looked ""normal"" and unlike the other progressive dishes, this one transported us back to 1906 Paris with Escoffier. Even the antique silverware provided for this dish is reminiscent of that time period. The service was executed with perfection as they make every guest feel important and special. It is no wonder that Alinea earned 3 Michelin stars and rave reviews - the attention to detail and level of service here is outstanding."
356,"If you have the money or like to save money for a meal you should go. It is really incredible. It only gets four stars because it's so expensive. It would get five if I could afford it more than once every five years...or when other people pay. The wine guy was kind of bogus too. I know the word for ""wine guy"" but because he was bogus I'm not going to call him by his title. Otherwise great experience. Great food. Wonderful presentation."
357,"I feel like i understood his vision, and the service was probably the best i have ever had at a restaurant. My brother and I got the tour and both left happy. The frozen mousse presentation by chef Achatz himself left me in a trance. The only minor grumble is that i wish they spent more of their courses on savories instead of the 5 or so desserts. Although none of them were not overly sweet (and the bubblegum cigar kicked ass), i felt at the end that my belly was mostly filled with sweets, something i would normally not do. In the end it was tottally worth it and i hope to come back."
358,"What's there to say about the best meal of one's life, except...I'd gladly endure 20-below winters and 90-years of baseball misery if it meant I could dine at Alinea on a regular basis. As a New Yorker, that's impossible unfortunately... 1 pillow, 5 hours, 7 servers, 10 MoMA-worthy presentations, 23 courses, 35 OMG moments, 48 new flavor combinations, and hundreds of dollars later, I was on a such a high that I tipped the maitre d $40 for remembering our coats. Sigh. Life is all downhill from this moment on. What, the Yankees won another World Series? Who cares...."
359,"My girlfriend and I went here just to experience what is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the world - we're not huge foodies or anything like that (and because of that maybe we didn't appreciate some of the nuances of the food/experience) we just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. First of all, the service was some of the best I've ever had in terms of them being there to help you out and make you truly enjoy your meal. My one gripe is that we were waited on by several people throughout the meal rather than one waiter which made it pretty impersonal in my opinion, and sometimes when I wanted to ask about some of the more ""out-there"" dishes I didn't really feel comfortable enough with the waiter to do so. Now the food. There was a huge array of different tastes, so it would be tough to love everything or hate everything. The one thing I will say is that all of the food you'll eat here is stuff you will never have had before, nor will you ever have again. Most of it is a hodgepodge of really interesting flavors that you'd never think to put together -- for me, some of these combos worked and some didn't. Overall I felt the meal leaned a little too much to the sweet and rich side of things, and I found myself always hoping the next course would be something light and not so rich. There were a couple of courses that I thought were really good, but nothing that I absolutely loved. On the other hand there were a couple of things that I really didn't care for at all, but as I said earlier that's to be expected with such a wide array of interesting combinations. All in all I would say that for the average joe, Alinea is more for the experience than for the food alone. My conclusion was that I certainly didn't regret going (even with the big pricetag), but it's also something I don't want or need to do again. If you've got the money, absolutely go. It's a lot of fun and is a great experience. If you're like me though, I don't think you'll find yourself breaking down the door to get back anytime soon."
360,"Yes, the food is beautiful, innovative,and interesting. I loved many of the dishes. however, the bottom line is that a couple of the waiters were downright, pretentious, rude, and unpleasant. Who needs that crap at an 800 dollar meal? I would never return to Alinea. Ever."
361,"For better or worse, this restaurant has a reputation to live up to. Three Michelin stars, number six in the world on the San Pellegrino list, and a price tag to match. For a place like Alinea, most people aren't lucky enough to go, ever, and even more won't be able to go more than once. The only basis I have for this is my one trip tonight, probably the only one I'll ever have. On this night, Alinea did not live up to that reputation, and my wife and I came away disappointed. The reason: we were seated next to a four-person table of the most disruptive diners I have ever experienced. Raucous, brash, bombastic, rude. Loud conversation the entire night, none of it about the food: in fact the food seemed secondary to their goal of consuming as much alcohol as possible. All of George Carlin's dirty words were spoken - announced - out loud (OK, not C---sucker, but really and truly we heard the other six). They made poop jokes about the chocolate on the dessert table. Five cell phone calls rang and were answered in the middle of dinner. At some points the laughing and yelling rose to a fever pitch that was only broken up when one of the women at the table shushed the rest of them, only to explode into laughter herself. Chef Achatz himself came out to serve their chocolate splatter course (by the way, it's quite novel), and even this did not sober them up - they heckled him for being too young to be a real chef. We were just one course behind them, and my wife asked me if I thought Achatz would also come to our table. When I said to her, ""No, I don't - it's just not our night tonight,"" she knew exactly what I meant. (He didn't.) The thing is, we loved the food - it was maybe the best I've ever eaten. For the first time ever in my fine dining experience, there was no course, no bite, no flavor in the entire meal that I didn't like. There were flavors and spices and presentations I've never seen or imagined. Some of the ingredients were quite sophisticated, others simple but surprising (Granny Smith apple sorbet, English pea puree, and parmesan cheese... who thinks like that?) And actually the service was great: friendly, conversational, respectful: our sommelier didn't treat us like naifs when we asked simple questions about the wine pairing; our waiters had mastered the art of being simultaneously knowledgeable about, and in awe of, the complex techniques their chefs showed off from the kitchen. But eating is an experience that involves all of the senses, and one year from now when I think about this meal, the memory will be of scraping delicious frozen yuzu from an insane minus 200 degree ice cone, while the man at the table next to me is asking the waiter for a shout wipe because he has so covered himself in flakes of chocolate, followed by the staff asking him to get up while they replace the chair because his mess has stained it to the point of unusability. I'll remember biting into a masterpiece of exploding truffle, and also how funny it is that the woman at the table next to us sometimes acts JUST like her mother. I don't know if there was ambient music playing in the restaurant, but I do know that the woman next to us uses Bruno Mars as her cell phone ring tone. And I'll remember getting the check and, for the first time at a four star restaurant, feeling a little like a fool for spending so much money on one dinner. I've left some suspense about one thing: did I speak up to the diners? Did I tell the staff? Did they ""make it right"" (restaurant-speak for free stuff)? Here's the thing: there's no making it right. This is a restaurant full of talented staff who know how much it costs to eat there, and who should know how to deal with this situation, but didn't. The four diners next to us were never chastened - no subtle request to take phone calls outside, no gentle reminder to the jacketless man that jackets are required (I was reminded twice, once when I called for the reservation, and once when they called to confirm). It should not have been up to us to ask these four people to quiet down. And as the only couple sitting next to the group, I didn't feel comfortable complaining about them to the staff while they were still sitting there. I spoke to our waiter when the group had finally left, and he apologized on behalf of the restaurant, said all the servers knew they were trouble, and they could tell when they walked in that they were pretty drunk already. He said they talked in their meetings about how to handle people like that. And then he said, ""I wish you had said something sooner."" I appreciate the sentiment, but it sounded like I didn't need to tell him. I wish they had acted sooner. Three hours into our meal, at about the same time that the offenders left, a couple was seated nearby to begin theirs. My wife and I looked at each other, and I knew we were thinking the same thing: I wish that was us."
362,"Alinea is the best eating experience I've ever had. Simply amazing. My GF surprised me with a dinner here on my birthday. From the moment we walked in, I felt like I was on sensory overload. Hard to imagine almost four hours flying by that quickly! We did the full menu (26 courses) with the wine pairing and it was just phenomenal. I do have to say, while it's worth experiencing the full deal just once, we will definitely opt for the 12 course next time. By the 20th plate, it was starting to get a little overwhelming! For me, great dining is about four things: Ambiance, Service, Wine, and Food. Alinea delivers 5 stars on all four: Ambiance - It's such a cool little spot, it only holds about 30 people, but it's nicely decorated in a modern/minimalist style. Despite the intimacy of the space, I didn't feel encroached by the neighboring tables. The clever and innovative designs of the serving devices/vessels were an unexpected surprise and was another demonstration of how much thought is put into the experience. Service - The hostess, wait staff and servers are amazing. They so obviously know and love their craft and they practice it with aplomb . I loved hearing the story behind the wine selections and the wonderful descriptions of the food offerings. Wine - What an experience! The wine pairings are so well thought out and added another dimension to the experience. Most were obscure selections which only added to the mystique. Food - The food was edible art. The tastes were like music, so much depth and complexity but all in perfect harmony. There were creative pairings, wonderful and unexpected shapes and textures, and most interestingly, the use of complimentary scents to enhance the tasting of the foods. This was a full blown Wagner opera of food. Honestly, this place tickled my soul. I've been to a lot of restaurants that were highly rated but turned out to be all hype. For me, Alinea exceeded my most optimistic expectations. I think a second visit will be even better, since there won't be as much sensory overload and hopefully I can better appreciate and understand the experience. I can't wait to return!"
363,"After my 24 course mind-blowing experience at Alinea, I wrote Grant Achatz a thank you note. For teaching me how to taste. It was an unrivaled experience that I have yet to encounter at any other fine dining establishment, though the chef's table at Charlie Trotters was also absolutely incredible--if you have 5 hours about a about $225/person to play with, do whatever it takes to get a seat at Alinea. The last time I ate there was a year or two ago and I still revel in the glory of that meal--the highlight of which came when a juniper infused pillow was placed before each diner, upon which the plate rested. As the course continued, the juniper wafting from the pillow perfectly complimented the entree. Genius. A stunning meal without pretension."
364,"If you're reading Yelp to decide to go to Alinea, stop reading, and just call to try to get a reservation. Amazing, once in a lifetime, incredible culinary experience. I thought that Alinea was like Moto (also amazing), but it's worlds apart - in great ways. Each course after course was spectacular. I don't want to give 'spoilers"" away on the experience, because it was just that - a great experience. Same with the food courses - since Chef Achatz changes the menu it just is a visual and I hate to type it again, but amazing. At one point I mentioned to one of the waiters, that I was expecting a 'throw away' course, you know the course, a ""non spectacular"" palate cleanser or something - and he said, oh, that course is coming - so great service, sense of humor, Chef's family (and I mean that in the exceptional customer service, from every person at that restaurant works in harmony - no necessarily related). I had a co-worker who was going 3 weeks to Alinea after me, and I didn't share a word about the place, and we both compared notes afterwards, which 3 weeks apart, some dishes were different, presentations, etc, so it's best not to know. There isn't anything bad or negative I can say about this place. Was it pricey? It was worth EVERY SINGLE penny, and I would do it again, and plan on it."
365,"I can now see why other reviewers had a hard time getting into the detail of each course; when there are 21 courses, it's not only hard to remember them all but they are each so unique, creative and an absolute culinary masterpiece, it's best to just experience them for yourself and not spoil the surprise. Service was impeccable, each course served perfectly, with a nice explanation of each ingrediant and flavor and on most courses, special instructions on how to eat it. We opted to order a bottle of wine vs. the wine pairing; prob saved us $100 and we were so focused w/ the food, I think having to focus on wine pairings would have been too much (imo). A unique dining experience unlike any we've ever had; def something you should treat yourself to at least once if you're in Chicago. It was our anniversary and Alinea was the perfect venue for our special dinner. Only minor complaint (and it's small enough not to deduct a star for) is that the servers could have been a little bit more relaxed and engaging. Not a big deal as they nailed the explanation of each course and anticipated our every request but a little more interaction and conversation (possibly a little humor) would have been nice. But then again, that's not really why you come to a place like Alinea."
366,"Alinea specializes in molecular gastronomy. If you don't know what that is think, food, performance art, and science. Confused... great keep it that way. I was planning on posting all the details about the meal, but honestly it's better to try it yourself. The price is not cheap but the experience is quite unlike anything you have ever tried (unless you've been to a molecular gastronomy place before). If your curiosity is piqued and money is no object then make that reservation right now. Now for those of you who insist upon a course-by-course review go to: http://tangmeister.com/a (complete with long-winded pretentious comments). The one saving grace is all the pretty pictures."
367,"In keeping w/ my ""do everything at least once"" mentality, my friends and I took on Le Grand Tour, the 20+ ""courses"" with the wine pairing. This was some time ago, but I still get a little teary-eyed when I reminisce about the deliciousness. This is a dining experience. If you are not going to appreciate the fact that this is intended to be a sensory exploration of gourmet food, science, architecture, and wine expertise then you might be better off at a local bistro where you can predict each outcome. Every taste on the menu is designed to be presented in a unique way, to bring out flavors or pairings of flavors in ways you'd never have imagined. As I recall, they actually partner with a ceramics artist and others who create plates/dishes or other devices (yep, devices) to suit the particular dish you are being served. I want to say each little bite is a work of art, is that too over the top? Each item was a sensory experience whether due to scent (using hot bricks to bring out the full scent of fresh rosemary sprigs with a particular dish, for example - -amazing and heady), for your eyes (a sculpture or sorts, with the tastes resting at the top), for your mouth (the consistencies of each food are so varied and unpredictable). Each item we ate that night was delicious and (ahem) might I say arousing?! I mean, literally, my senses were so completely aroused, it was so decadent. We ate from approx. 8pm to maybe 2am, fairly nonstop. At the end, I was full in a good way, but also loaded (the wine pairings - - perfect) and so content. The staff were all cordial and our servers had great personality. As I recall, the four of us spent about $1200, so think of it as a little food vacation that you should experience, because you deserve to be a celebutante at least once in your life. I keep meaning to go back. I'll stop now, I'm whipping myself into a food frenzy. . . ."
368,"After Alinea, everything else is just sustenance. Alinea nails idea through execution on the head. Whenever I eat, I always think whether ingredients could be added/changed, or whether an interesting idea wasn't carried out well. I could find no fault with any of our 16 courses. Not only are the concepts of each meal unique and cutting edge, the flavor/texture combinations were prepared perfectly. If you want to try something you've never tried before, THIS IS IT. Also, the service was seamless and the staff was genuinely happy and personable. My boyfriend ate out at almost all of Vegas' top restaurants (Michelin-starred or otherwise) during a 9-month work project, and he still states that none can compare to Alinea."
369,"I am a little slow in doing my yelp reviews but here goes... We went here for my wife's birthday in July and having now been to what some may consider the big three in Chicago (Trotter's, L2O and Alinea), I can truly say that Alinea is far and away the best dining experience in Chicago. From a pure flavor experience, you are dealing with an outstanding restaurant but it is the creativity and uniqueness that separates Alinea. Having the centerpiece of the table being greens that later get incorporated into a dish was a surprise and the truffle explosion while being an Achatz standby was a fantastic bite among others. We will be back to Alinea to see how they can surprise us next."
370,"I came here with my parents for a birthday celebration and I must say, it was one of the most unique and exciting places I have ever been to! The food was impeccable and beautifully presented. Would definitely come here again."
371,"Alinea has been my ""Mecca"" for years. I booked a trip to Chicago for the sole purpose of eating here. This led me to fear that I had built it up so much in my head that it could and would only disappoint. Oh how wrong I was. This restaurant exceeding my exceedingly high expectations. As a chef myself, I can only aspire to be half as brilliant as Chef Achatz and his staff. Every dish was impeccable (the most perfectly cooked foie I've had in my life). And the staff was very accommodating, tolerating my need to photograph both every course and every wine pairing. I even took a pic of the crazy-haired sommelier, who took my experience from amazing to out of this world! In my opinion, the only way to eat here is to do the full 24 courses. If you are going to go big, go big! Worth every penny and even more. The creativity behind every course may possibly blow your mind. I know for me, it took me from on the verge of burnout to highly inspired to just... cook!"
372,"Just getting on the band wagon here, since it has all been said before by 700 yelpers before me. I had ridiculous expectations. I've been to Schwa, L20, Tru, Next, Bonsoiree and Moto (you can say I love to eat out) and I'm a New York transplant (I proudly ate through New York the 5 years I lived there). And I have to say, I've never had such a beautifully crafted, wonderfully executed, ridiculously ingenious, tasty and elegant meal in my life. From the start of the meal (lifting the pumpkin centerpiece to reveal that little morsel inside) to the end (smashing that chocolate egg over a modern art sauce landscape), it was fabulous. Yes, it costs an arm and a leg to dine here. And yes, you will be uncomfortably full by the time you get out (and it may be almost 1am since the only reservation you could score was a 9pm on a Sunday), but for a special occasion, it is just the place to go."
373,"I ate at Alinea for my 25th birthday (I work in restaurants; I made the reservation about four months before the fact and scrimped and saved to do the whole thing), and it is absolutely the most amazing meal I've had. I went with a buddy, and we had an absolutely amazing experience. The service was officious without being stuffy (especially after we talked to them and got them to loosen up a bit), and the food was superfluous. I don't think I ever need to spend the kind of cheddar we did for that meal ($400 APIECE), but it was an absolutely amazing experience."
374,I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I ate at Alinea. Everything about this restaurant is PERFECT!! I just wish I had another $450 bucks to spend on a meal!! The meal was magical! It was like being in a dream! If you can make it to Alinea and you have an open mind...GO FOR IT!! You will not be disappointing!!
375,"just got back from alinea again...i feel blessed...for the good life i have...for being able to make a reservation in a relatively short notice...and for having had once again, one of the best meals in my life....."
376,"I have been meaning for months to write a long review, but as time passes my memory only becomes less distinct. Alinea is a truly unique experience-- by which I mean both that is weird but also that it is very very good. And I say that as somebody who is ideologically dubious of overly processed foods. We had the smallest tasting menu with no alcohol, and still left full, happy, and on the verge of overwhelmed. I can't imagine how much practice it takes to survive the more extensive tours. I am not sure I would want to go on a regular basis, but it was worth every penny of the (large) check to go once."
377,"Wow. I went here with a friend just to go. It was absolutely amazing. The ""black truffle explosion"" is the best thing I have ever had. It tasted exactly like it's name. We did the 12 course tasting with wine pairings. Some Yelpers have said to do the 24 course full tour with no wine pairings. I would disagree - if you have to pick one or the other, do the 12 course with wine. The wines are so perfectly paired that it elevates the entire experience to a whole new level. At about $750 for two 12 course meals with wine pairings, coffee, tax and tip, it's not cheap...but it was worth it!"
378,"So much has been written about Alinea. The restaurant is an extraordinary experience, yet I can't give it 5 stars. I waited a couple of weeks before writing because I wanted to be sure of my impressions. Fyi - we had the twelve-course meal. What I didn't like so much: fishy-greasy smell when we walked in. And overall, several preparations were too salty for my taste. I was ready to love everything. But as the evening progressed, I didn't have that blissful ""yum - bring it on"" feeling. There were too many fried onion slivers as well. And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter. Hmm, dangerous food; interesting. What I liked: attentive service; comfy chairs (important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal). The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve. Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces. Beautiful presentations (the people at the table next to us were snapping photos). A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages. Considering the complexity of the food, it's too bad that saltiness stands out for me. Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun (I skipped the onions). The dishes were beautiful works of modern art. So I'm wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost? Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray? I'm glad I went to Alinea. I'll always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family. If I'm looking for purely delicious though, I'll choose Tru or Trotters."
379,"The wife and I went to Alinea several months ago, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. A relative of the wife works there and so we decided we would try it out at some point. We were not disappointed. From the moment you open the unmarked door, and walk down the hallway, you start to wonder what you're in for. You open the inner door, and voila, the hustle and bustle of the kitchen greets you from the left, and the staff stand in front of you dressed like they are members of the CSO. We sat upstairs and went with the 12 course plus wine. The courses were taste sensations. A thick piece of smoked bacon dipped in butter scotch? Delicious? Yes? Oh yes. I wanted another one. The duck with dark chocolate nestled atop the savory duck. It was by the far the most ambitious flavor combo of the night and it worked. Lobster foam? Foam that tastes like lobster but looks like... foam. The ambience does not disappoint either. It's very expensive, but it's a meal that regular folks should have once or twice in their lifetimes. I would go again."
380,"I highly recommend this place if you have $$ to spend. Alinea is by no means affordable. Its uber extravagant for frou-frou food that won't actually fill you up. (I ate a few pieces of Fannie Mae chocolate and some Garrett's caramel popcorn afterwards). 5 stars though, because after you get over the fact that its $$$$$, the food, and service, was phenomenal. You're not paying for the food, you're paying for the entire experience. The restaurant has no signage outside, except for a well dressed guy standing in front. He opens the door for you. Before you is a short hallway, with wavy planks of paneling to the right, pink lights illuminating them. My friend and I walked to the end, only to realize that it was a dead. For a brief second, I was confused, unsure what to do. Then miraculously, a ""wall"" slides open and you see the entrance of the restaurant, with 2-3 people greeting you. Its like an amusement park ride!! Service was awesome. The well-dressed servers were attentive, and some even had a sense of humor! The restaurant was a little chilly, so I asked the waiter for a glass of hot water. Not only did I get a glass and a hot pot of water, but they also gave me a pashmina! Wowee. Food - taste, smell, touch, sight. The only thing missing is sound! Each plate that came out was incredible, talk about avant garde food. The interactive senses were seriously at play here. Highlights: - Dessert served on top of a pillow that expelled scent of lavendar - Dry ice thingy that ""erupted"" with billowing white fog scent of ""grill"" served with kobe beef and mashed potato cube. - An individual bacon drizzled with maple, hanging from a thin cable contraption - One spoonful of the most delicious ""tortellini"" that exploded with flavorful juice and...caviar? Wanted more. Delicious! - One slurp of truffle with potato, served in a little shell with ingredients strung on a needle. From beginning to end, we were constantly surprised by presentation and taste. Sweet onion cotton candy?? If you are a foodie, and have saved up some $$ for a fantasy food experience, you must try this place!"
381,"Alinea is amazing in every sense of the word. Dining at Alinea is not just a dinner-- it's an *experience* that awakens all your senses. As my birthday present, my boyfriend took me here and we dined for nearly six hours until 1:00 am. (You can have your dining experience last as long as you want-- you'll never feel rushed, and you're treated like family. I suggest that you savor every bite because the molecular gastronomy technique is showcased at its best at Alinea, and you should immerse yourself in the total experience for as long as you can.) My boyfriend and I each got the 23-course dinner and paired it with wine. It was absolutely amazing-- we loved every bite. The potato ""soup"" was delicious and the ""steak and potatoes"" dish was ingenious. I don't think any review can even come close to describing how DELICIOUS and out-of-this-world the food tastes, but please know that all the five star ratings that Alinea earns is a true testament to its culinary art. The atmosphere is intimate with the restaurant sectioned into little intimate, dimly-lit areas that house only a couple of tables. No one takes flash pictures because no one wants to disturb any other diners. At the end of the dinner, you will be invited to tour the kitchen. Definitely don't miss this opportunity to see the chef at work and to see how the kitchen is a spotless, well-oiled machine. Everyone knows his/her job and everything is done efficiently and quickly. You will not be disappointed, and you will be simply amazed by your dining experience. Go on the website: (http://www.alinea-restau), enjoy the pictures, and definitely dine there if you are in Chicago."
382,"Given the lemming-like nature of most human beings, poor or rich, it does not surprise me in the least that Alinea receives nothing but accolades from the diners on Yelp and other sites. Admittedly, some praise is actually well deserved, but much isn't. To sum up briefly: Alinea was a huge let down. The dishes were very hit or miss, e.g. loved the oyster leaf but hated the lemongrass drink which was sickeningly sweet. The ""chocolate explosion"" (My name for it) dessert, personally prepared (Not tableside but rather on and all over out table) by chef Achatz, was visually and viscerally exciting, but sadly, fell flat in the all important flavor dept, all I could taste was an overpowering cinnamon like flavoring. I could go on and on about the other dishes but I'll spare you and myself the agony. What I also found disturbing was that most of the dishes presented were generally very ""safe"" and almost boring at times. (Compare to Ferran Adria's 35 course tasting menu) You'll know what I mean if you have eaten at restaurants which execute the idea of molecular gastronomy in a manner simply unknown to Alinea. There was no underlying context to the cuisine either- just a bunch of randomly presented experiments for the most part. Last but not least, the hostess who ""greeted"" us on that late night of September 30th 2011 needs to be retrained. Its not polite to look at your guests up and down as if scanning to see if they are suitably dressed. My wife's 6 month old left shoe costs more than she makes in a month and I am certain, is at least as intelligent. For those who have eaten at the late, great El Bulli , Fat Duck or even Mugaritz, you can safely skip Alinea. If you don't get out of the country much then I suppose you have no choice but to check it out- but don't say I didn't warn you."
383,"truly amazing food, FIVE STARS.... however the wine pairing was poorly explained and the lists should be printed out for review. The Sommelier could have been nicer and should have explained that some wines were meant to last three courses. The Desert was improved over last years tobacco mint sundae. This was the last time due to the Cryptic crappy wine pairing, lack of wine list and weird wine pricing. They should implement an ala carte wine pairing with actual prices per glass instead of a flat rate. The wine was great but the way it was handled was so bad that it brings down my overall rating which is a shame because the rest of the place runs so smoothly..NEXT."
384,"What can I say, it's been over 6 months since I've been to Alinea, and I'm still not sure what I think of the place. I know I want to go back, but that's more out of curiousity than because I really liked their food. Don't get me wrong, there were some fantastic dishes to be had at Alinea. In particular we really liked the Sour Cream, Melon, Finger Limes, Pineapple and Strawberries. But there were also some real duds. Duds. There's an interesting word. When I use it to describe Alinea's food, it's not because the food lacked flavor. On the contrary, I'd say that certain dishes contained too much flavor. Or at least too much of one flavor that the dish seemed imbalanced and over powered by items that were supposed to play a supporting role. One of the first dishes that springs to mind is the Broccoli Stem. This was a disappointing dish because I had been looking forward to it after reading about it online. The grapefruit in this dish and the steelhead roe just completely masked this poor broccoli to the point that you could have put almost any vegetable in there without making much of a difference. Then there were dishes like the Porcini that tasted like nothing but pureed sunflower seeds. Oddly, since the porcini flavor is similarly earthy and nutty, it was just a muddled mass of goo in my mouth. I think this was the only dish I didn't finish. Other dishes were just disappointing because, as creative as they were, they just actually didn't go far enough. The Beef (flavors of A-1) had all of these little flavors to try with your beef, but they didn't give you enough ink in your well to truly experiment with the canvas they gave you. I actually just rolled mine all up to combine all of the flavors and didn't bother trying to mix-n-match in what appeared to be a futile exercise. I realize that I've focused almost exclusively on the negatives here, but that's because I figured there is enough praise and drooling on the eGullet forums that I should give a counter point. Don't get me wrong, I can certainly understand what people are raving about and I really do think Chef G is an important figure in the American culinary scene. I think his influences will be felt for years to come, especially as he becomes more established and more of a household name among non-foodies. Regardless, even after months of reflecting on our meal, it just doesn't change the fact that we walked away disappointed. Some have been criticized for going without having an open mind or they just don't understand the cuisine or numerous other silly knocks. I can confidently say that I went with an open mind knowing fully what to expect, but the food, or more specifically the flavors, just didn't seem like anyone tasted them before putting it on an antennae and sticking in front of me. This got me thinking about the experience of dining. An interesting thing about dining, is that a single dish isn't going to make or break a meal. The experience as a whole is what people will remember when they decide if they like a restaurant. A particular dish is what people will remember when they decide if they like a particular flavor profile. A great example of this is The French Laundry. Aside from the Oysters & Pearls, I can't say there were a lot of dishes that really stand out in my mind, yet it was one of the best meals I've had in my life. In contrast, I remember quite vividly several dishes from Alinea, both good and bad, yet it was probably our least favorite meal of our entire Chicago trip (Ann Sather being the other). So no, I didn't enjoy our meal there. Yes, I would encourage others to go. Yes, I enjoyed the challenge. And yes, I'm looking forward to returning. Weird, I know.

385,"This place was an experience. From the moment you walk in you know you are about to experience a choreographed show where food is the main attraction. You walk in down a purple-lit hallway which opens up dining room that feels like a scene out of Willy Wanka. When we first sat down they placed what they would only cryptically reveal to us were ""functional place settings"" on the table. My dinner companion described it as a ""food circus."" I would say it was more than just a meal; it is performance art. I think the video here is very helpful in understanding how they picture Alinea to be very much about the experience: http://www.youtube.com/w The dishes are mostly things you have never experienced before. It's hard to put them into any particular bucket, but there are definitely some strong asian influences at play. Unfortunately somewhere in the 16 courses and experimentation of flavors means you lose the ability settle into a comfortable place and just enjoy eating good food. There was very little savory content to the experience, and halfway through the meal we were talking about how exciting the hot dog we would get after dinner was going to be. The one area where the video leads you astray is when it says the restaurant is not pretentious or self-important. You need to wear a jacket to not feel out of place. The people dining around us were all on the older and more serious side of a good time. Each course is delivered to your table and explained by a waiter who is cooler and edgier than you will ever be. The courses are served in custom made place-ware that looks like someones twisted version of the future. That is with the exception of the course that was served on place-ware from the 19th century. I could go own, but I've already said too much. I don't want to give away all of the secrets of the place, and especially not the ending. So my rating... I would give Alinea 5 stars for the show, 4 stars for the food (interesting but not quite satisfying), and 3 stars for the pretentiousness. That averages out to 4 stars, but really, you should be going for the show, so its probably worth checking out."
386,"Most of the other reviews pretty much cover how spectacular everything is at Alinea. I cannot agree more. The place is unassuming with the entrance on Halstead. The long hallway to nowhere when you enter is a neat illusion only to be surprised by the doors halfway down on the side. A friend and I did the tasting menu along with the wine pairing. Each of the 16 courses was great. Some over the top amazing, but all were great. The staff was amazing and extremely knowledgeable. Even better, they are very observant. I was chewing gum when I sat down, and nonchalantly, I was given a paper napkin on a serving dish to dispose of the gum. Each of the courses was paced perfectly and the wine was matched very well. The black truffle explosion was probably the table favorite. The savory courses outweighed the dessert options by a lot. The appetizing courses were delightful as well. The seasonal choices of everything was absolutely perfect. Even the watermelon with the brook trout was a good twist. It is pointless to go on and on about each course, but just GO AND GET THE EXPERIENCE. Being in New York and having a veritable plethora of fantastic restaurants, I must say no experience is as complete as this one in Chicago. Definitely worth the trip, the time and the investment. Hoping they open another concept like this in NEW YORK soon."
387,"So, I'm browsing through Yelp like anyone else who has nothing better to do at 9:30pm on a Wednesday evening. After writing soo many reviews of restaurants down the street from me and declaring that I love them because they are so close (yes, I am lazy), I have finally decided to write a review for one 800 miles away. And after reading a few of the reviews for Alinea, I have very little left to say. There are several reviews detailing each course down to a pretty molecular level, so I guess all's I'm going to say is that Alinea chef Grant Achatz is incredible. The food is extremely delicious and each course is like a party exploding in your mouth. I love expensive meals but that is only because I don't know how to properly budget my own money. This is one of the priciest meals that I have ever had (probably because we participated in the constantly-refilling-your-glass wine pairing as well), but well-worth it in my opinion."
388,"Thank god I wasn't paying for this one! If you want a crazy dining experience and have the patience to sit through four hours of dining, then please check this place out. But honestly, they are just too full of themselves here. I didn't want to talk as I was afraid I would disrupt the cathedral to food. The wine pairing was outrageously expensive considering most wines came from Serbia. The food was certainly an adventure and an experience I'm glad I had. I particularly liked the six shot glasses full of vegetable extracts that were lined up in front of us. The deep fried pork belly hanging on a wire was also intriguing."
389,"This is, by some distance, the most memorable meal I've ever had. EVER. I came here in June 2008 with three friends (one of whom miraculously managed to wring us a reservation). The experience lasted four hours, but was touched by pure wondrousness from the moment we began. The service was, in a word, perfect. The decor, while moderately formal, is designed to be comfortable. One absolutely astonishing aspect of Achatz's genius is how he managed to make every aspect of my vegetarian menu look exactly like the original counterpart. Highly highly recommended for one and all. I'll let the other reviewers on here elaborate further."
390,"For the adventurous foodie, this is as good as it gets. If your taste buds are a little more on the conservative side you may not enjoy the food as much. Personally while the experience was top-notch, some of the food was a little adventurous for my taste. We had the 12 course menu and by the fourth course we were already counting them down. The first course almost made us gag - a bowlful of fish eggs and fishy foam wasn't the best way to start. Thankfully the food did get better - highlights were the lobster course and the bubble gum course. I made a note for the future when they ask about any allergies or food dislikes speak up about my food dislikes. I thought that I would throw caution to the wind and let the chefs guide the night, but in hindsight I should have spoken up. Service was top-notch, save for the head waiter lecturing another waiter for yawning without covering his mouth. We requested a tour of the kitchen before we left and were escorted in to see the chefs in action. The personalized menus were a nice touch. Five stars for the experience and the quality of food, but at $175/pp for the 12 course menu I'd rather go to Gary Danko in San Francisco or pay the extra and head for French Laundry."
391,"Okay, I'm editing my review because I've realized that my previous post didn't do Alinea justice. Let's start at the beginning: About three years ago, my husband (then boyfriend) treated his parents and I to Alinea. He kept talking about this restaurant that was difficult to get reservations for, and was excited that we had somehow gotten lucky enough to secure a spot on a Friday night. I didn't pay too much attention to him, just figured that we were going to what was probably going to be a nice dinner. Even the fact that I knew beforehand that we were in for a 24 course extravaganza, which I hadn't ever heard of before, couldn't have prepared me in the slightest for the experience we were about to have. God, I had no idea back then. Anyhow, we arrive at the restaurant and have a seat near the window. We decide on the 24 course dinner with the wine pairing. The waiter brought us some perfectly wonderful and delicious bread, and my first instinct is to devour it until our server friend wisely advises us against this, telling us that if we skip anything, it's going to have to be the bread. Long story short, 24 courses and (I kid you not) a few tears of joy later, my life is forever changed. I have married my boyfriend, and we have tried to live more humbly in order to save up for experiences like the one we had at Alinea. We travel around the country, and indeed the world in search of the most amazing culinary experiences, ones that make you close your eyes and bury your face in your hands in utter and sublime disbelief. Pregnancy has put a bit of a hold on our adventures, but after the baby is born we are planning on perhaps celebrating back at Alinea, though we admit to feeling a bit nervous, as we don't know how our next experience can possibly top the last."
392,My fiance made reservations for Alinea on the night he proposed. We had been talking about going for some time and it lived up to every expectation. Each course was delicious and and wonderfully creative to eat. Almost every course was served by a different waitor and they were all friendly and helpful. I can't say enough what a wonderful dining experience it was!
393,"A wonderful dining experience that really plays with all your senses and throws you for a loop occasionally as soon as you find the building and enter the door (you have to been there to understand). I enjoyed every one of our 23 courses, the presentation of each is a highlight as is the taste. Meet Grant Achatz ""plating"" our desert at the table was a nice surprise, but after 22 courses, this one is too overpowering. Great concept, probably most memorable dish from a visual impression, but just too much at the end. With having said all that, a definite must for anyone who likes avantgarde cooking and couldn't make it to El Bulli while it was still open ;-) Anthony Bourdain's review of Alinea in his book Medium Raw is great, a bit tough, but closes out fairly."
394,"We had an amazing experience here. Everybody else has talked about the food (which was AWESOME), so I'll say a few things about the staff. We had a great time with the 10+ people we had serving us throughout our dining experience. We certainly didn't experience any pretentiousness during our dinner. Even when service errors were made (one of the items was spilled on the table) it was recovered with a smile and a joke. I thought that was great. Instead of focus on the mistake, we were challenged to try and serve the pieces ourselves. We also elected to order two bottles of wine instead of the wine pairing and went on the recommendations of the wine director for a Viognier and a Grenache. Outside of the pairing these wines complemented our tasting experience quite well (with some dishes certainly better than others). Overall, this was a tremendous dining experience and I look forward to having an excuse (and the spare cash) to go again."
395,"Seems almost pointless to review a world-renowned, five-star establishment with over 140 other reviews (at the time of this writing, anyway), but I might as well pile on. My best friend and I were flying to Chicago from Atlanta to witness his younger sister's graduation from Northwestern, so we made a reservation to a place we'd heard nothing but astounding things about. Turns out, these grand statements were completely true. We got the 12 course meal with wine pairings and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the meal of my life. From a dish resting on a pillow of scented air that deflated as the meal went on, to what amounted to a shredded duck candy bar to any number of immaculately presented treats, Alinea was a feast for the eyes, stomach, nose and mind. For what it's worth, our meal took about four hours and we each spent around $370 for food, beverage and tip. But I will never forget it."
396,"It is difficult even for me, a gifted verbal gymnast, to come up with the appropriate superlatives to describe my dining experience at Alinea. I have eaten at some of the world's most highly regarded restaurants and this was by far the best meal I've ever had. This is for two reasons: one, flawless execution of the meal (in taste, service and the creation of atmosphere); two, it made me a believer about a type of cuisine (experimental) that usually underwhelms me. My husband and I shared the 12 course meal with wine pairings, and they were gracious enough to pour me a smaller amount so I would be able to remember dessert AND it was reflected in the bill. Nice. Some standouts from our meal where the hot potato/cold potato, the kobe beef with powdered A-1, the alaskan king crab and the black truffle explosion (which was essentially an Italian shanghai dumpling). Every course was incredible and the wine pairings were thought-provoking, particularly a Spanish sherry that was much more sophisticated than most I have tasted. If I had to pick a bone or two: the chestnut dish was my least favorite, a bit cloying and just too much AND I felt that there were too many dessert courses (this is saying a lot for I generally have an insatiable sweet tooth). But ending a large meal with all that sweet kind of put us over the edge, particularly because the last bite was a bit of fried sweet potato pie! The service at Alinea is the kind of service that makes one hyper-aware of oneself, because it is obvious you are being watched peripherally by the ubiquitous staff. At one point, I went to take a sip of water just as a waiter was coming by to preset silver. He saw me lift my glass, back-pedaled and then returned when I placed it down again to do his business. I love that. I also liked that the servers had some personality. I kept wondering what it would be like at the ""office holiday party."" If you find yourself in Chicagoland, go to this restaurant. It will set you back some coin, but I'm sure you won't regret it."
397,"Obviously this is a good restaurant, and it is certainly worth visiting if you can spare $500 dollars. And so since the city only really has 2 of these mad scientists- and in a comparison of Alinea to Moto. I think Moto wins. Alinea was just a bit too stuffy and stiff for my tastes. The service is awesome, the food is spectacular and restaurant itself is beautiful yet minimal, so how come it was stuffy? The place is quite, you feel like you are in a library, and the servers while very prompt and professional seem very hesitant to chat or even mildly socialize with you, and seem to me like they were being watched by some secret cameras, to be later judge and fed to the lions if they had steered away from their routine. Our meal was fantastic and there could be nothing else said to be that it is what it is- I just preferred moto's younger spirit."
398,"I'm reviewing this WAY too late to remember the finer details, but figure I'd chip in my two cents. I called in reservations about a month early, so not sure how hard it is to normally get reservations for a Thursday night. They called to confirm the reservations the day before, which is always a nice touch. The restaurant was kind of hard to find, and once we got in the door, seemed like a dead end. Then the door to the left slid open, which was a really nice touch. Everyone was really friendly and we were seated in the usual fancy restaurant manner with the table being pulled out and all that. We had the smaller menu, which was MORE than enough food. Everything was certainly quite good, it seemed like some of it was more for the sake of presentation than flavor. Every course was served by a different waiter, which was a little distracting, but as a result, the waiters were able to expertly explain what each dish was and how to eat it (and for some of the dishes you really need the explanation!). There were also matching breads for all the salty dishes. The butter-themed dish was my favorite, followed by hot/cold potato. The desserts were all good, but I didn't have much appetite left by then. I suppose if you want to enjoy these, you better skip on some of the breads. The service was amazingly attentive and paid a lot of attention to detail. We just had hot water with our meal, and the waiter made sure to keep pouring in more hot water to maintain the right temperature. The decor was simple, and the tables were spaced far enough apart that you couldn't really hear the other tables. However, that doesn't really mean that the place was quiet, as there is still a low hum. My final verdict is that it's a place you HAVE to try once (if you have the budget) if you're in Chicago, and probably only once. Save it for a nice occasion. It'll totally be worth it. Side note: It was raining cats and dogs that night, so I autopilot locked my keys in the car. The valet came in after us and asked if I had the key. Nope... I told them to just call the locksmith, but later on found out that the valet had his own set of tools. No damage to the lock, so I gave him a handsome tip. However, makes you wonder how many people end up in this situation..."
399,"Sure, it's fancy and interesting, but I left hungry even after tasting menu with the wine pairing. Went here in 2008 and maybe I was expecting too much. I would be willing to try the next time I'm in Chicago."
400,"One of the best dining experiences. The food is prime, the experience is amazing, even their soda, they make themselves- and they are GOOD. The start was a series of edible cocktails. Quite a pleasent surprise. The play with texture, color and taste of the food is amazing!. The portions are just enough for you to get the real taste and experience, but small enough to keep you wanting more. The suspense of what comes next is part of the amazing experience! You will be wow-ed from beginning to end."
401,"I design themed immersive environments for a living and eating at Alinea is THE immersive culinary experience for your pallette. Having lived in New York City & now Los Angeles I have been lucky enough to eat at what are considered to be some of the top restaurants in the world. Alinea is by far the most amazing meal I have ever had. The whole experience is immersive: taste, smell & sound. I recommend adding the wine pairing to the tasting (yes much more expensive, but so worth it). The decor is soft modern bordering on minimal. The staff are attentive without being overwhelming. There is a great write up of Alinea in the most recent WIRED magazine. All I have left to say is ""freeze dried caramel that dissolved on our tounges""."
402,"Definitely one of my top three fine dining experiences of all time. We did the 12 course meal with wine pairings...don't know that we really could have consumed much more than that. We had high expectations coming in to this place, and they were actually exceeded. The collision of flavors, the visual and tactile experience of each course, and the simple decor amidst the formal, yet efficient, service made for a very special night. You really do use all of your senses here, so it's important to pay attention so that you don't miss the show that is your meal. Our waiter was our guide along this culinary journey, and he showed personality and humor that we weren't expecting from this type of establishment...it was a pleasant surprise that enhanced the experience even further. And be ready to drop some cash...our set 12 course meal with wine pairings was just shy of $700 with tax and tip for two. Some might consider this overindulgence, but this is just one of those places that every foodie has to try at least once in their lifetime. Grant Achatz definitely deserves every accolade he's ever received."
403,"Go ahead, Play with your food! That's what chef Grant Achatz and the Alinea staff invite you to do. Play. Think. Engage. This is not just a meal, it's an experience and should be treated as such. We brought a camera (no flash) and a small moleskin to jot down impressions. (for those who feel awkward about bringing a camera, note that by the end of the night your less intrepid fellow diners will be jealous - a woman sitting at the table next to us gave us her e-mail address and asked us to e-mail her our pictures). The meal was superb. Although I enjoyed nearly everything I consumed, I want to call special attention to the frozen pea puree course and the Earl Grey course. The frozen pea puree was like getting a garden in a glass, the flavors and textures managed to be both interesting and delicious. This is especially noteworthy because I hate peas. Additionally, the Earl Grey dessert course was amazing. A visual display of both vibrant and subdued color coupled with a host of different flavors and textures to try together or individually. Again, I should mention that I hardly ever drink tea, and of the teas I have tried I really detest Earl Grey. How amazing that a chef can deconstruct a flavor that I hate and reinvent it into something that I LOVE. The experience has actually made me want to re-visit Earl Grey tea and try it again while thinking about all the flavors in this dish. One other must-note is the self-assembly spring roll. I love spring rolls so this was ""no-brainer"" delight for me. Not only do the bold colors and flavors stand out in this dish, but the ability to choose your own components (I recommend everything) and put it together yourself adds an element of whimsy and participation. It made me realize that many of these courses are not just a one-way delivery of a meal from the kitchen. They are more like plated conversations. The staff is not just creating FOR you, but you are creating something together; experimenting together. I found the service impeccable, but the constant switching of servers made it a little difficult to develop a rapport with one. That being said, having two members of the kitchen staff compose the last course for you (quite a visual display!) table-side was a great touch and a nice way to directly talk to someone working in that artist's studio they call a kitchen."
404,"I have passed this place a million times, but had no idea it was even there...it is truly a hidden gem. This place is AMAZING! This is not just food - it is an experience so you have to go with an open mind. Every course is an adventure on its own that had me asking the same question over time - What the heck is it, how do I eat this, and why is this soooo good?! No worries though, the waiter explains before you can even ask. My palate matured leaps and bounds from this meal alone! The service was impeccable! It was perfectly orchestrated from beginning to end. My glass was never empty. There was never a single crumb on my table. If you have go to the bathroom 10 times, you will use 11 napkins for they replace it every time you leave the table. During our dining, my boyfriend dropped a little chocolate onto his shirt. Not 30 seconds later, a small plate with a napkin on it was placed onto our table. He picked up the napkin and a shout wipe fell out. At the end of the evening, upon receiving our copies of the menu to commemorate our experience, I noticed that mine was wishing me a Happy Birthday...nice touch! So was the extra treat they slid in for me. To top it off, this is the first time, I've ever been escorted to the door at the end of dining! If you love food and drama, this place is it."
405,"3 Man crushes in life. (Scott Definition of ManCrush - People he really admire and think are larger then life) 1) My Father - Obvious. Worship and Love him completely 2) Steve Jobs - Leonardo Da Vinci of the 20th century. A guy who has the unexplainable ability to productize design and technology with the user in mind. 3) Grant Achatz - The Chef / Owner of Alinea. A culinary genius who beat tongue cancer and is a true culinary artist a la Monet. Wife and I came here during our trip to Chicago. In fact, we probably would have come here just for the food but a family wedding gave us plenty of reason to plan far in advance, which we did. We booked this place before we even bought our plane tickets and boy did it not disappoint. For those that read this probably already know about the legend of Grant Achatz and the status of Alinea as the #6 restaurant in the world. I came here with extremely high expectations and was prepared to be wowed. It's hard to understand the genius of food until you eat here. I would have to say Bazaar at SLS in Beverly Hills was still one of my favorite meals due to the focus on gastro-chemistry but Chef Achatz menu is one that focuses less on trying to overwhelm the diner but instead, take them on a fun journey of food. What does this mean? Well, the plating for one is a true experience at Alinea. From the use of a vanilla bean as a utensil to the silicone dessert table, Chef Achatz uses many advanced techniques to prepare and serve the food but he does not lose the poetry in the food itself. I appreciate how he keeps it simple in order for you to appreciate the food but when you dig into the actual dishes, you realize how much thought and preparation goes into each dish. I love the carrot handroll with the tobacco extraction and short ribs that you had to make yourself. My favorite dish was the cold pea soup but my wife's was the cold potato / hot potato truffle soup and the shrimp stick thing that had an amazing dipping sauce... One thing I will say is that the wait staff was quite attentive but I found some of the more senior wait staff dry and in some ways, a bit too stiff. Perhaps I am more of a casual person who likes to enjoy his food and the people he is surrounded by, so in that sense, I would say that I have had better service. It's not that anyone was rude but I can't help but wonder if these people take themselves too seriously. It's hard to explain but I would have appreciated a little less pretention and a bit more warmth. That being said, some of the other waiters were also quite funny and nice, including a server who had just completed his 2 yr anniversary and had a pleasant personality. We waited at the front after dinner as Chef Achatz was kind enough to show us the kitchen and the front of the house, specifically the tall female (I think her name was Mallory or Melanie) was fantastic. She gave us a tour of the kitchen and helped make it even more memorable, like she understood that for many of us, dining here was a once in a lifetime experience. Finally, I have read some reviews or blogs about Chef Achatz that dared to proclaim the chef as a prick. To that food critic, you are an asshole and a pretentious contrarian who suffers from the exact problem that most food critics share... someone who abuses his power to share his opinion and someone arrogant enough to think his opinion matters. (Basically an article about a misunderstanding over a photo taken during the private viewing of Next and Aviary). My wife and I couldn't find the Chef more charming and more humble, and I must say, meeting him and his demeanor made us that much more impressed with the meal. This is a guy who beat cancer and during much of the time of his treatment, came to work every day. This is a genius who is considered by many to be the finest chef in the USA who came to our table and painted our dessert for us. This is a guy who thanked me for coming to eat at his establishment and who wanted to make sure our photo came out good. Chef Achatz, if you ever come across this review, you are a revelation. TWO WORDS: MAN CRUSH"
406,"Wow. I was prepared for a ""food as a chemistry set / circus"" experience and while chemistry was a big part of it, I was blown away at the taste sensations and just plain great food. Everything was super. We did the 12 course with wine. Mind boggling good. Service was top notch. Jaw droppingly expensive of course but worth it."
407,"This place is worth the hype. I planned a trip to Chicago specifically to go to dinner here. Yes, that sounds crazy, but it was worth it. We did the 24 course menu with beverage pairings. Everything was incredible. The service, the food, the wine, the decor, everything! I have to say I wasn't full after the 24 courses (and being on a foodie vacation, I had already eaten deep dish and hot dogs at Hot Doug's earlier in the day). If you're going to Alinea, just do the 24. I wouldn't have been satisfied with 12 courses. I didn't travel all this way to be in and out. Just go for it, and you'll be happy. It was about 3.5 hours. I can't compare this place to anywhere I've ever been. It's a once in a life time dining experience. If you're a foodie, or want a special occasion place, this is it. I'm honestly having trouble getting excited about going out to eat since eating here 2 weeks ago. It's just that good. PS. Hot potato, cold potato, and truffle explosion are insane!"
408,"Alinea is definitely not your run of the mill restaurant. This is about as foodie as it gets (or as foodie as I've gotten) and diners should be aware that when you come to Alinea, you're coming for a complete gastronomical experience that caters to all your senses rather than just for a typical meal. I believe reservations for Alinea need to be made some time in advance but I managed to find an opening a week before my trip to Chicago last September. The restaurant itself is fairly inconspicuous. Even as you enter the building into an empty hallway, there is no clear signage directing you to the entrance of the restaurant. Instead a sleek sliding door opens up almost as if you're in some underground secret lair. Needless to say, it was pretty darn cool. We came for the tasting menu which was comprised of 13 different courses. Each and every one of the courses was a unique tasting experience. You could tell that the chef took time in thinking about how each flavor would complement one another, and also how each dish should be presented. Dish after dish presented food that actually made you think about what you were tasting, smelling, and feeling. I won't go through each and every course but I do remember the wagyu beef as a standout (as it always is). The service here was prompt and professional albeit not at all overly friendly. I wouldn't go as far to say that it was a stuffy atmosphere but they definitely could have had a bit of a sense of humor. The dining experience is indeed an exceptional experience but it would have been nicer had it been perhaps not so serious. Overall, I would definitely recommend Alinea to anyone who is open to trying a new food experience and isn't too concerned about the minor damage to his/her wallet as the price per person starts as $150 for the tasting menu. It will definitely be an experience you won't forget."
409,"I shall give this restaurant 4 stars because the service, creativity, and presentation of the food is just superb. Taste-wise, the food did not completely blow me away. There were definitely some outstanding dishes but there were more ""okay"" dishes than I would have liked. However, I really think it is more a matter of personal preference of the foods served. I have to give props to those who manage to do the Tour. I had the Tasting, and I was pretty stuffed at course 10-11. I was kind of hoping the food would stop coming. The wine pairing is recommended if you can handle your drinks. Ladies be careful. That port at the end is STRONG, and they definitely give you more than what you'd get if you ordered port at other restaurants. The sommelier is knowledgeable but if he were lying to us, we wouldn't have known the difference anyway. None of us are that well-versed in wines nor are we very knowledgeable about the small towns in some European country of which the vineyards are located. The service is great. If someone sees you leaving your chair, they rush over to help you out. They lead you straight to the hallway to the restroom and open the door for you. Your drink (if it's not wine) is constantly being refilled. The waitstaff will even joke with you! As far as the food goes, it's a hit and miss. My favorites, though, were the curry pork belly spring roll and the hot potato/cold potato. I'm not even a fan of truffle, but my goodness, that dish was savory. The creativity that goes into the dishes were amazing. If you had not told me what I was eating, I would probably never figure it out except for maybe a few ingredients. I love how they use scents to further the eating experience. Overall, the meal was definitely an experience, and something to try once, but I don't think I would come here a second time."
410,"i feel like its a culinary sin to not give this place a full 5 stars... but im giving it 4.5... i hope i don't get struck by lightening!! Alinea was amazing, the experience the service the people. The food was so mind blowing, you're constantly being surprised and confused and left scratching your head. So why -1/2 a star? Despite all its greatness, i just wasn't a huge fan of the food, the experience was amazing, but i just don't see myself ever craving something i ate there... and i feel like food no matter how complicated it is, should leave you dreaming about it tomorrow. One of the biggest biggest issues i had with my food was that it was WAY TOO SALTY. and i have an extreme salt tooth, i put salt on everything i add salt to salt and vinegar chips, so i can handle salt... and i couldn't handle some (most) of the dishes that were brought out. My friend felt the same way. Now unfortunately i don't know if it was just a mistake that day and someone slipped? or if that's just how it is.. but it made some things difficult to swallow. I loved that they gave us menu's after the dinner, i actually ended up leaving my menu somewhere, and when i called they were happy to send me a copy to my home. But they never did. =/ sad and lame. i absolutely recommend the experience and i hope the salt was just a fluke."
411,"I love these types of restaurants! Fancy-Shmancy restaurants are great! I did the 12 or 18 course tour with wine pairings as opposed to the 24 course tour. I wish I had done the 24. My initial thought was that the decor was phenomenal, very classic contemporary and clean! The hostesses were nice an pleasant, our server was professional. Our sommelier was hung over and lacked sleep and it was obvious. Kind of a spikey-haired club guy but knowledgeable and the pairings were great. Then the food started coming out and everything was (literally) mini-bite sized or amuse bouche sized. I thought they would get bigger as the courses kept coming, perhaps has we got to the savories, but nope, never. I believe one course was simply an ""essence"" and nothing to eat. Everything was very cleverly presented and beautifully plated. I loved the various explosions of flavor and textures. Delicious for sure BUT I truly wish there had been more substance in at least ONE course. I have eaten at Tru, Trotters & Moto and I think they're all great Alinea was also great but if I could change one thing, I would make the savories a little bigger. Otherwise, I would strongly suggest the 24 course tour - if you want to be full that is the way to go."
412,"Not sure how it is that I haven't reviewed this place yet. This was pretty incredible. We did the 24 course menu, which is pretty much the same experience as everyone else has already reported. This is definitely molecular gastronomy in its purest form. I learned quickly that I am not nearly as much a fan of it as is my boyfriend, but regardless of whether you prefer the style, you should try alinea at least once in your life. Everyone needs to have this kind of experience to get a better understanding of the culinary arts in general. Incredible experience."

414,"Mmmmmmm. I had the 24-courses (plus the fois gras extra from the chef) and was in culinary heaven. It really doesn't get much better than this. I'm a vegetarian and lactose-intolerant and the chef was soooo great about it! When we made the reservation, I asked them if they could do a vegetarian option and they overwhelming accomodating about it. When they called to remind us about our reservation (how could we forget??) they double-checked I want it all vegetarian and AGAIN when I sat down! Holy smokes. It was fabulous. I've never felt so amazing after a meal.. slightly too full, but worth it. Bravo Alinea. You live up to the hype!"
415,"We enjoyed a fine 12 course experience at Alinea. I'd say the wine pairings were quite wonderfully well done. We did have three courses where we were not at all wowed by the food and that really surprised me. I will recall my past experience at Moto and say that I did not have any course that I found to be lackluster. For the money, that should absolutely be the case. Kudos to the staff who were watchful, never intrusive and completely informative on the food experiences and the wine pairings. We also appreciated the small details of our coats and car were already waiting for us by the time we reached the lobby to depart. The atmosphere was austere as one might expect. Our table was so large that my date and I had difficulty communicating without shouting, which I found to be a bummer as it was a very quiet place."
416,"Almost three months after we came here to celebrate our anniversary, I still think Alinea was our most unique food experience ever...even if I can't remember the majority of the dishes. We ambitiously made a reservation for what we thought was 20 courses and when it turned out to be 25, we thought, okay, we can do that. Big mistake. By 18 or so, I felt like I was about to burst and I was really glad I wasn't wearing a tight dress. We had to ask if they could just skip a few for us, and they were nice enough to let us choose from the remaining courses. Note to self: even tiny plates can add up! What impressed us most about Alinea was the service. We went through maybe 21 or 22 courses and with each arrival, our table was cleaned, new utensils arrived on a cushion or tiny platter, and we were told a story about each of our wine pairings. Our servers and sommeliers really knew what they were talking about and no one made us feel like we shouldn't be there (which has happened before seeing as we look fairly young). I have never been so spoiled at a restaurant. We also discovered a delicious muscat that we regret not buying then because we haven't been able to find it since. The quality of the food was impressive and each course was so meticulously plated that for the first few courses we were both gingerly stabbing at our plate, trying not to ruin anything. That night was also the second time in my life where my food came with instructions! For example, one of our courses required sliding a slab of meat off a pin and dropping it into a bowl of sauce before mixing it up and eating it. There was also one where you had to drop a ball into a tiny glass and let the liquid react before drinking it. And there was one mini treasure hunt for the pork inside a tall bowl full of pine needles (that one smelled really good and tasted even better). Of course, the nutmeg pillow had to be my favorite looking as it was pretty cool to watch your plate slowly drop to the table as the pillow deflated. If you like experimental dishes, you'll love Alinea. We're both glad we were able to experience pins and cushions and foam galore, but in terms of taste, some of the flavor combinations just didn't work for us."
417,"A must dining experience at least once in your life. I'd wait until your first credit card at least. Superb service, that of which can be compared to the royalty treatment. And the food, O M G the food. it's unheard of-- imaginative, creative, totally outside the box. Avant- garde at its best. 1. No menus- you choice is either a 12 or a 24 course meal. We had the 12 course = 4 hrs. 2. Between the two of us, we had one wine pairing. 8 different wines paired with 8 of your 12 courses. I ordered a glass of champagne and sipped my boyfriend's wine pairings every now and then. 3. Sit back, relax, and enjoy."
418,"Holy CRAP.... We had the 12 course and boy was I surprised. For the first time I had dinner using ALL of my senses. Presentation was on a whole other level, you'd never think to mix soy sauce with chocolate?! Service was very attentive and at the end of the night.... I was in heaven. We spent a good 10 mins staring into the kitchen....they've got a gazillion and one ppl working the line. By the way, when you first walk in, it's like boarding the space ship on star trek (oh yes, the doors slide open)...crazy!"
419,"The longest, most expensive, and most interesting dinner I've ever had. We had the 12-course tasting menu, and it really added up to quite a bit of food, I can't see how people could eat much more! The service was VERY good and despite the dress-code and the high-prices, they weren't condescending at all, and very comfortable and knowledgeable. I'm glad I went, but this is maybe a once-every-four-years type of place, just because it's that rich - oh yeah, and I don't go to Chicago that often."
420,"Was with Tracy O. at Alinea. I had the full tour menu with wine pairings. The service was amazing - they strike the perfect balance between being attentive and trying to meet your every need and expectation without somehow smothering and hovering over you. Although, maybe waiting for me to get out of the bathroom to push in my chair was a bit embarrassing. Especially, since I was sidetracked by the Alinea book on my way out. Also as a note to servers: don't get irritated with a customer because they didn't tell you they don't like X when you specifically ask ""Are you allergic to anything?"" How was I supposed to know you wanted to hear about my recent campaign to stop the disgusting overuse of truffle in, on, and around everything in Chicago? I don't use ""allergies"" as an excuse. So how about asking if I have any dislikes or preferences? Food - to be perfectly honest I was rather disappointed. I was happy I had had the ""Alinea Experience"" but was rather unimpressed with the food. There seemed to be far too much of the same textures (aka mushy squares and gelatin squares). The only dishes I would say were good were the pork belly, the bacon - sweet potato -mustard (served as a threesome) and the desserts. I did also enjoy the cauliflower which I almost hesitate to mention since me liking veggies means the rest or your food must be.... Wine - Oh my goodness. Amazing. What I craved after my dinner at Alinea was to come back for a night of fantastic wine, baskets and baskets of the amazing bread, ""donuts,"" rolls and cheeses as unique as your wine. Now that would be a perfect 5 stars."
421,"I don't know what to add to the heaps of praise dumped on this establishment, but I do know that each of the three times I have experienced Grant's wizardry has been one of the peak dining experiences of my life. Simply, it boils down to this. Regardless of all the advanced and scientific cooking techniques they employ, the food here is always grounded in the fact that it should first and foremost taste good. Sure, there are parts of an Alinea dining experience that are inventive to the point of being wacky, but it's not just for wacky's sake. Every twist, every invention is rooted in respectful consideration of the ingredients--they let the essence come through, and how they do it is really clever and fun. The presentation is like getting to eat art. Tasty, tasty art. And science. The staff is attentive and friendly without being obsequious, removed enough to let you enjoy your meal at your pace, but willing enough to talk smack about wine, food, music, etc. if you are on your fourth glass of paired wine and feeling chatty. I am going back in a couple weeks, and won't even blink at the price. I shop at thrift stores so I can afford this food."
422,"Alinea is amazing, and Alinea knows it. I. Loved. Every. Second. My experience at Alinea reminds me of going to an amusement park with my best friends: I smiled and was delighted for all of the three hours I was inside this womb of culinary wonder. I went to Alinea in mid-March '08 with an old friend. Remembering this occasion fondly, I think about the food and the drink all the time because I have never eaten food created with such precision and focused so hotly on taste and experience. We each had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was exquisite. The nutmeg pillow was so wonderful, I'm dreaming about it still. The Amarone was a sip of joy. The waitstaff and sommelier were wonderful, as one might expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by their professionalism which was delightfully lacking in pretension. You need to eat here. I don't care what anyone says: Alinea is worth every silly penny."
423,"I have given many places 5 stars but Alinea is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to. It's always a fun and unique experience every time I dine in this restaurant. The food is outstanding, surprising combinations of ingredients, out of this world! It definitely gives the wallet a workout but it is worth it. I recommend this restaurant! You will love the food and the experience!"
424,"The high concept culinary experience that Alinea provides is almost indescribable. At first entry to the hidden, unmarked building, doors slide open and give diners the feeling that they are walking into the future. Chef Grant Achatz spent years at Napa's famous French Laundry and has elevated the level of innovative cooking at his Chicago eatery to that of pure science and elegance. Food is presented in the most creative ways (a slice of bacon on a wire, a potato and truffle on a pin) thanks to Crucial Detail Design Studio (http://www.crucialdetail). Service is impeccable, with waiters wearing fine suits and having superb knowledge of daily offerings. The twelve course tasting menu paired with their suggested wines adds to the whole dining experience and the Spanish Verdejo was the standout."
425,"Came here to have dinner after running the Chicago Marathon. The place is not very easy to find, but, we had no trouble locating it within Lincoln Park. As you step inside, the walls temporarily gets lower and closer to you until you hit the sliding doors which opens you to the first view of the restaurant. Chef Achatz has a modern feel to his establishment. We sat on the second floor with very attentive hosts the entire evening... felt like there were 4 attentive people caring for us the entire meal (lasted 3 hours). Let's see.... we got to sample his menu, which consisted of at least 10 items.... which were all exquisite in their respectiveness. I won't go thru the entire menu, but, my favorites included the Apple 'shot' with horseradish and celery, the pheasant with the scent of the burning autumn leaves, the maitake broth, and the nitrogen-freezed chocolate dessert. Everything tasted great and it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should be considered. I was content of having the chance to dine here. If you make it to Chicago, consider Alinea!"
426,"Alinea is excellent. If you are considering going to Alinea, go! You will not regret it. Also...If you go, definitely get the tour tasting menu.....after all, if you are going to Alinea you have to go all out."
427,"They managed to live up to the ridiculous hype surrounding the restaurant, so that' saying something. It was actually as good as I'd heard. Service was fantastic, and the food was completely on another level. The sweetbreads were unreal. If you're ready to pay $200-$300 pp at the minimum, then this is the best dining experience in the city."
428,"As a vegetarian, I was not blown away by Alinea. There are so may interesting directions for vegetarian food, and I feel that they didn't capitalize on any of them. Instead, I received the same thing as everyone else, just with some vegetable or mushroom substituted for the meat in each dish. A decided lack of creativity there, something for which the establishment is supposedly known. In particular, the offals dish for the meat eaters: I received just mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, etc. as substitutes, whereas the chef could have gone all-out with strange and crazy vegetarian equivalents to offals (e.g. fermented, molded, tofu?). But it seemed the look, not the concept, of the dish is what they replicated. Also, the wines were a bit too sweet for my liking. In general they seemed to pick underdog varieties, and it was fun to hear why they were actually better than everyone thought they should be. Despite my negative comments, everything was very tasty and it was an interesting and fun dinner. I'm glad I experienced it."
429,"I'm departing from my standard review format since Alinea has been reviewed by so many other people and I generally agree with their comments. Below are a few comments that you hopefully find useful and unique. The food - yes it's amazing. One note, Alinea prides itself on ""surprise."" If you're looking for ""traditional"" food or a common theme there are others that do that better (Charlie Trotter's Comes to mind). The service - unbelievable. One of the ladies in our party rubbed her arms as she was a bit cold. A server was over within 10 seconds offering her a pashmina to use to warm up. Yes there is a wine pairing that is optional. It costs approximately 75% of the price of the meal. So if you are doing the tasting at $150, the wine parings will run $113. I would estimate the size of the pairings is equal a standard 4oz pour. I recommend the pairings, but if you are looking to keep costs down this is an easy place to do so. The Chef Achatz name rymes with Jackets and Rackets. There is an Allinea book. Published in 2007, this ""cookbook"" is really more of a coffee table book with great photos and background on the restaurant. It makes an excellent accompanying gift if you are taking someone there for a birthday,etc. Finally, I know you've heard it before, but black truffle explosion. WOW."
430,"Tour de Force This is the ultimate dining experience. Alinea is the only FLAWLESS dining experience we have ever had. That was not luck because we had the same mind blowing experience twice here. Walking in you know you are some where different and some where very special. Everything is meticulous and perfect. Every dish speaks for itself. It is brought to your table with care, usually on a custom make plate, spoon, or wire. It is explained and usually a story about how the dish came to be. I also recommend wine pairings to accompany each dish. Words can not do justice to this experience. Pray for Grant because he is going through some tough time battling cancer."
431,"Look, Anyone who doesnt give this place 5 stars is clearly influenced by the bill. I can totally understand as it was $700 for two of us to eat. Seeing as though I am not Jay-Z, that kind of bill was tough to stomach. That said, even the Jiggaman would give props to this place. The bottom line is I enjoyed every single part of this meal. I can fully say that I went into Alinea trying to hate the place and was pleasantly surprised at every aspect of the place. At first I thought I was entering the Matrix. Then, while eating, I knew I was in some kind of Matrix. Please understand that at heart I am a dive bar kind of guy. I'm not really into a scene and I can easily say this place is so unique that it will never become a scene (that and the price is prohibitive). Nevertheless, I am happy I went there. The goose was phenominal, the potatoes were fantastic, and the dessert was incredible. I would go again for the first time but my pocket will need to recover before I go again. GO AND ENJOY!!"
432,"Best. Meal. Ever. I ate here 2 years ago and I still fantasize about it. Yes, the experience was fun and unique... but the FOOD. The food. SIGH. I will be back!"
433,"My boyfriend took me to Alinea in August. Upon entering the outer door of Alinea I felt as though I had entered some sort of weird sci-fi movie. Walking in from the street you are instantly sucked into an alternate world. The dim dreamy light and curved hallway lead you to doors that instantly open. There the hostess greeted us by name (how did she do that?!) and immediately led us to our table. We did the 12 course tasting with the suggested wine pairing. Started out with a shot of vodka! I think this was excellent, not only for the course of food but to relax before you splurge half a months rent on dinner. The rest was a delightful blur. Highlight: Black Truffle Explosion, I think I love you! Creative! Amazing flavors! Great experience! Impeccable service!"
434,"My boyfriend took me here for my last birthday and it was the best gift ever! Since I've moved to Chicago I've become somewhat of a hardcore foodie (as much as a grad student's salary allows--a lot of restaurant week outings), and a friend of mine had been raving about Alinea. The food was amazing, as you can tell from the other reviews. We had the 12 course menu. The experience was incredible--every dish had its own story and way of eating it, it was the most fun grown-up experience I've ever had. My boyfriend is also a vegetarian, and they made all the same dishes with vegetarian alternatives--he loved it as well. In all my experiences with vegetarian tasting menus, it almost seems like the ones that start out all vegetarian aren't as good as the ones where the meat/fish part is subbed out. Now I think of the worth of things in terms of Alinea dinners. Like, should I go away for Thanksgiving, or save that plane ticket for a dinner at Alinea? You can guess the ending. I would highly recommend this for a special occasion. You'll have to save up for awhile, but it's totally worth it!"
435,"There isn't much else to say about Alinea other than everything has been so carefully thought out and planned down to the perfect combination of art and science. By far, the best meal and dining experience I've ever had. (having been to les nomades, everest room, charlie trotters, tru, the former Trio in evanston...i think i can say that.) My taste buds were so exhausted from all the amazing new textures, temperatures, surprises and flavors throughout our 3 hour dinner. Everything, even things that I wouldn't normally like, like crab mouse, was delicious. I have to say the menthol chocolate dessert at the end was my least favorite dish...mainly I feel it was more a gimmic and theatrical display, than a great dessert, but everything else was total genius. Oh wait, actually, the course Thai Distilliation, was totally not a course people...at least it shouldn't have been counted as a course...it was a beverage, picture half a glass of champagne...but oh well, perhasp that was over my head. I highly recommend going to Alinea at least once in your lifetime. I'm trying to figure out how I can reason with my check-book to go again next year!"
436,"Just to get the chance to review this place is a privilege in itself, and to be honest, I'm writing this more for me than I am for the yelper community. In a way, this review serves as a souvenir I can always find, so that I don't forget just how amazing it was to eat at this Temple of Edibles. So, Dalyte, in case you ever forget: You were served a dessert featuring caramelized white chocolate that looked like branches from a bonsai tree. And it was sitting on top of a PILLOW. A pillow that was filled with earl grey-scented air. Despite your better judgment, you wanted to eat the pillow, it smelled that good. You were served an assortment of dishes that featured crab in forms that you never considered, namely an icy crab sorbet. And it was delicious. Your dishes were paired with wines from all corners of the globe, and their exceptional deliciousness transformed you into a pretentious and dissatisfied oenophile for a good month. Once the meal was over, you went downstairs and stared through the glass windows that looked out on the kitchen, observing Grant Achatz and his team of chefs work their magic. You felt like a kid at the north pole, watching Santa and his elves. You stayed there, observing, for maybe half an hour or so, as other guests followed your lead and joined the show, your eyes glazing over with delight and bitter-sweetness, since that epic meal was now over, and your wallet was significantly lighter. Make no mistake. It was worth every penny."
437,"Alinea is a total sensory experience. It isn't just about the food, because come on, the food and presentation are obviously innovative and exquisite. It's also about the restaurant itself. I have just entered a new dimension. I am walking down a narrowing hallway, when a door automatically slides open into the waiting area where a host/hostess waits to greet you. I glance past him/her into the spotless kitchen and spy chefs work with intention and precision. I follow up a flight of stairs into the dining area where our culinary journey is about to begin. We chose the tasting menu. I did not elect to have the wine pairings because I'm a lightweight, but I did enjoy the champagne cocktail that starts with the first plate. It is hard to pick one favorite because they were all good, but the desserts stole my heart, and the dishes that invoke your sense of smell first were also particularly enjoyable. I'm not sure how people do the tour, because I was stuffed with just the tasting. I like the personalized menus that we received at the end of our meal, where we learned that the chef had given us an additional dish that originally is on the tour. The dinner lasted just under 3 hours. We stood in awe at the flawless process going on in the kitchen as we waited for the staff to flag down a cab for us. It is a well-oiled machine. Quite impressive. I could have watched for hours, but alas, a cab finally arrived. The automatic door slid out, and we were out of the dimension and onto plain old Halsted Street again, but this time in a satiated haze. Grant Achatz, you are my hero."
438,"The most unique, exquisite and thoughtful meal I've ever had. To say it's an experience is an understatement. There's a reason this restaurant is ranked in the top 10 restaurants in the world. The flavor combinations are unexpected but wonderful. Pricy? yes, but worth every penny of it. There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said. But I do know that I will never forget my meal."
439,Easily the best dining experience I've had in years. The Black Truffle Explosion is an absolute masterpiece. People who like large portions might be disappointed (as they would with most tasting menus). Wine pairings were perfect.
440,"Alinea When the beauty of rustling leaves becomes culinary Sankai Juku, Godfrey Reggio, Haruki Murakami, Shakespeare, and Jasper Johns provide the context for my understanding of Alinea. My expectations were of food theater, and these were addressed, but with a hushed intensity revolving around more dimensions than it is possible or productive to relate in a review. Culinary performance endeavor may be a more apt description. The art and soul of the endeavor are things that grow organically from a myriad of explorations and reflections. I could carry on like this, but I'd just be saying that among other wonderful things, there is poetry here and I surely enjoyed it."
441,"Went in 2007, and it was the best dining experience I've ever had. I can go on and on about the sensory experience will provide you or how amazing the food is but I think it's well covered. I do have a few things to note to add to it's awesomeness: 1. The company I was with (God forbid she ever read this...) was in love with my ex, so I thought it would be a few hours full of awkward turtleness. But no, the food made us bond more than anyone would have expected. Since she was with me during my first experience in the House Grant Built, she'll engrained in my memory as a good friend. 2. I've experienced the tasting menus of Tru, Spiaggia, Moto, Spiaggia, etc. and I must say for the splurge you'd do at any, the quality of this one makes it a steal compared to the others. (respect to said others) 3. I usually collect the menus from fine dining establishments and have the chef sign them. After our meal, Grant came out to meet us. I had my menu and pen ready, but he was so good-looking, I froze and didn't ask him to sign my menu. (blush) I still cannot believe someone so young and handsome made the best meal of my life, kicked cancer's ass, and has a slew of accolades. I'll work up the courage next time!"
442,"What else is there to say? Exquisite. Loved everything about it. Was going expecting an amazing ""experience"" but got ridiculously fantastic food to go along with it. Would go again in a heartbeat (as soon as I can save up some $$)! I bought Chef Achatz's cookbook (which I use as a coffee-table book -- the photos are gorgeous and who are we kidding, I'm not going to be able to recreate any of the dishes) and would highly recommend this as a way to fondly remember a great meal."
443,"I. Love. This. Place. Chef Achatz has truly mastered the fusion of food and art and consistently creates dining experiences that put to shame pretty much any theatrical experience I've had. The food is always spectacular, creative, beautiful, and entertaining. It's definitely among the most expensive meals you'll have, but it's so worth every penny. I do, however, have 2 main beefs with Alinea: 1) Certain dishes get too much play. If you go once this isn't a problem, but become a repeater and you're going to see some things over and over. This is OK, but some of them were mediocre to begin with; bacon just isn't all that great, the transparencies are cute, but not very useful, and the yuba is just not that tasty. 2) Every time we go I don't get to meet Grant. Last summer the final dish was a table-side preparation that he was personally performing for every table. We were the last people in the place and he left just before our serving, so we got the second string. This is... annoying; I had specifically stated up front I wanted to meet him because I hadn't on previous visits. I understand that he can't always be at the ready for every request, but it was a little bit of a slap in the face that we were the only people in the place whom he didn't serve for. That said, I still highly recommend you find a way to make a visit. It's an experience you'll never forget. Having eaten at the Fat Duck the week before my last visit I can honestly say Alinea is a much richer experience. A few words of advice, though: -Eat well the day you go. If you starve yourself and then go you'll be miserable by course 13. -Pace yourself. Let them know a few dishes in advance if you need a break. It's a several hour experience, you don't want to rush through it. -Don't get the tasting, get the tour. It's twice the food and price, but the tasting is like getting the Cliffs Notes of the meal. -Get the wine pairing. The sommaliers do an excellent job of finding the perfect pairing, and can work around your personal tastes. Well worth the cost. My biggest wish is that they'd move it a little closer to Dallas..."
444,"Look I can't add more to what other reviewers have already offered up. This is a unique experience - while this does not go to the extent of Moto in terms of over-the-top scientific creativity, I give Alinea the edge on simple foodie excellence. Given Chef Grant Achatz's health troubles, I'm not sure where Alinea will go in the future. Book now. This is a culinary experience that is unmatched. And go for the 24-course Tour menu."
445,"Hands down the best meal you can ever ""experience"" We came here right March 2009. Alinea tops French Laundry, Piccaso, Gary Denko on my list of top restaurants in terms of originality, taste and creativity. Hot potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter - this is rather interesting dish. you pull a needle and let the truffle drop and drink it all at once. It's a bit salty Yuba - shrimp,miso, togarashi - this is like an appetizer with the shrimp entwining the pretzel stick. This is artistically beautiful Cauliflower - fiver coatings, three gels, cider - this is a big plate well presented. Very rich and filling with cheese Pear - olive oil, black pepper, eucalyptus - a bowl that when opened the smell of fried eucalyptus expose Wild striped bass - saffron, shellfish, parsnip - this is one of my favorite. Fish is perfectly cooked Yolk - soy, wasabi, yuzu - not good. not tasty just a yolk inside some gel Chicken - sesame, morel, indian flavors - this is another bigger plate. good flavor and pretty display Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme - just a piece of bacon which you have to tear down from a dangling steel holder Sweet potato - bourbon, brown sugar, smoldering cinnomons - this looks like a fried ball on an incense stick Mustard - passionfruit, allspice, soy - i think this was just a dab of ice sorbet Foie Gras - turnip, shiso, sudachi - yummy. Only 2 little cubes but taste great Lobster - popcorn, butter, curry - this is really good and fresh lobster Pork Belly - iceberg, cucumber, thai distillation - another rich dish Black truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan - haha this is one of those that tastes very salty due to the truffle. You bite into a little wonton and the truffle juice is filling up your mouth Wagyu beef - powdered A-1, potato, chips - love love love the beef. freshest taste. This is paired with a dry ice aroma which started out as the centerpiece Grape soda - one bite - really this is just a gap filler piece of candy Yogurt - pomegranate, cassia - some tiny dessert . nothing too special Bubble gum - long pepper, hibiscus, creme fraiche - this is rather cute you are suppose to suck the candies out of the cube Transparency - of raspberry, yogurt - just a piece of candy. very light Rhubarb - goat milk, onion, lavender air - this dish is sit ontop of an object like a pillow which is filled with lavendar air. Chocolate - prune, olive, pine - i dont remember too much about this Dry caramel - salt - again just one small bite but we were very full by then Overall I am very impressed. Definitely the best upscale restaurant in the North America in terms of artistic presentation and taste."
446,"There are many reviews here and elsewhere that capture various aspects of visiting Alinea, and there's no need to repeat any of that. My advice for anyone curious about the place is to not think of it so much as a restaurant, but as journey to the edge of the world of culinary experiences. The food, and the cost, is fantastic in the strictest sense of the word, and this is not a place to go unless you are specifically seeking a unique and outrageous evening that involves all your senses, with food used as a medium of expression. I was challenged to keep track of all the flavors, aromas, textures, and even sounds and visual effects, and eventually just relaxed and let it flow over and through me. I am still ""digesting"" it all several days later. If this sounds weird to you, then don't go. You'll be bewildered and might even feel had. If this sounds fascinating and you're not squeamish about cost, odd ingredients, and treating food like art, then don't put off your visit until ""some day"" that may never come."
447,"Amazing, truely as good as it gets... If Denis Miller's recommendation was not enough for you, this is an amazing place. The taste and textural revolution that achieved here is nothing more than mind bending. At Everest, and Trotter's, I go home disappointed since I could have made the meal better at home fora fraction of the cost. Here, the cost is a non-factor... Best restaurant in the US or Europe. Period."
448,"Quite simply the best dining experience I've ever had -- from the inventive design of the entrance all the way to the final course of the meal. The food is on par with Tru, but the innovation in both the dishes and their presentation is unparalleled. There was a fun surprise through every step of the 12 course meal, and the wine pairing was phenomenal. All of this without the level of pretension you find at Trotter's or Tru. It's priced accordingly, of course, so you'll want to observe the experience for special occasions! Enjoy -- Alinea will NOT disappoint!"
449,"I mean, the best meal ever, hands down. Grant Achatz is a genius. Not only the most innovative food I've eaten, but its by far the best service you will get at a restaurant. Everyone who waits on you (and its a team-effort) is super knowledgeable without a hint of condescension. The sommelier was younger than me, which made me a) regret my own career choice and b) trust him more. You will walk out of here way po', but super full, and in awe of what you just experienced."
450,"What an unforgettable experience I had at Alinea.... Loved all sorts of unique approaches to food. It's like ""Think outside the box"". It was absolutely phenomenal. Food itself was not expensive, but it was the wine that really was pricey in my opinion. I'm not a wine connoisseur, so I can't really comment how good it was, but I know they paired with many rare wines that you don't see in other restaurants. Waitstaffs were overly attentive and nice. If you have special guests that you would like to treat, this is the place to go! But make sure you book in advance."
451,"I would like to use this review to thank everyone at Alinea for such an incredible experience. From previous reviews, I was expecting pretentiousness and narcissism. What I found was a staff of professionals, who take pride in what they do. To call it a meal would be to disregard everything else that came with the endeavor. It was food, art, ambiance, entertainment, and best of all surprises. I was delighted in the way Alinea can present the unexpected. The kitchen can best be described as an operating room. Absolutely clean, calm, harmonious. Everyone working in unison. Take the time to experience Alinea for yourself. It's worth the time and money."
452,"About as good as food can get... But you'll pay for it, lol. Seriously, this place is supremely expensive, to the point where I never would have chosen to go if I wasn't dragged.. boy was I wrong... Obviously not the place to go for your everyday dinner, but it's an amazing experience. the front door is frankly a little intimidating, you kinda feel like you're walking into a psych experiment or something (the walls collapse around you as you walk toward the end of the hall).. But everything is amazing there.. even foods I thought sounded pretty gross tasted phenomenal. I highly recommend doing the wine pairing as well.. It costs more.. but how often are you going to drop this much money on a meal anyway."
453,"YES. All of the positive, even fawning, reviews are correct. Best dinner ever. My small add: Get the wine pairings. They are brilliant and be honest, you won't do this again so do it right. Remember that It isn't just food, it is a performance, with intricate pieces of presentation hand-crafted for your dinner. We had a mod-art teeter toter with a piece of bacon dangling from it AND wine glasses from 1904 and 150 year old silver. Used at the same meal!? Pay attention to the details and be amazed. You will leave full and drunk and happy. Cheers."
454,"I went with a group that had been to Alinea previously (I was visiting Chicago) and they described their previous dinner as superior to the one we shared. It was still fun, although I would like to return. I was expecting an experience like Per Se, but Alinea was more playful, and I have mixed feelings about this. I do not necessarily think building a fake beach to eat off is fun or interesting, and eating a turkey meatball of a pine branch is goofy, but does not necessarily improve the food. I think restaurants indulging in this kind of playfulness frequently get a by on their taste level. All that said I would like to go back. As I mentioned, the group I was with said a previous meal had been better, and I think the Alinea could improve my palate and offer interesting culinary experiences. For now, however, it's OK, and I can't firmly recommend it to all those interested."
455,"Wooowww. I'm not even sure where to begin with this culinary adventure but if you are a foodie this is just something I'd recommend doing at least once. It was cool how each course had some sort of interactive component of consuming that to the point we joked that Alinea bought their utensils and silverware at a Staples or Office Depot. Each course was imaginative though not all were home runs in my book. Service was great. Our wait staff bantered back and forth, and joked with our table which was nice - nothing snobby about this high end restaurant. I do have to say though if you're going to take pictures there is a no flash policy which was kind of a bummer given how dark it got for how long we sat down for. Certainly a memorable experience!"
456,"I had dinner at Alinea about two months ago. As a young chef, I've been a fan of chef Achatz for a while and was very excited to finally get to try his food. The evening was perfect. The food, the atmosphere, the staff, etc... Truly one of the best meals I've ever had. The flavors that lingered on my palate balanced the following dish perfectly. There was a squab course I wasn't the biggest fan of but if I only had one complaint out of 20+ courses, I'm okay with that. The price was high as is expected of any 3 Micheline star restaurant but I'd gladly do it again and look forward to the next visit!"
457,Did the 23 course tour and it was the best dining experience I've ever had. It did take 4 1/2 hours but every dish was unique and something I've never had before. Every dish was an adventure. The presentation was outstanding. Service was superb. Also did the wine tour and tasted some of the best wines I've ever had. It was expensive but you're paying for a 4 hour experience and adventure in food that you're not going to get anywhere else. Well worth it!
458,"One of the best eating/dining/service experiences of my life. My friend Shelley and I dined here a couple years back before they got famous and we did a 7 course tasting menu, took 4 hours and the service from the staff was amazing. They weren't stuffy, had some fun with us, we had fun with them. Pricey, worth it. Good wine pairings, we did the whole shebang. As usual, asked for a tour of the kitchen. Pristine. The orange blossom aromatherapy pillow on my plate (and then telling me to breathe in deeply) was a bit much, but I'll forgive them. :)"
459,"My fellow Yelpers have written great reviews on this place so all I will say is that my experience at Alinea was the highlight of my trip in Chicago. The food was amazing and I was wowed with the presentation and flavors. Truly an unforgettable dining experience. If I could give it more stars, I would. You expect greatness from a restaurant that's listed as #7 on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list (up a few notches from last year) but it still exceeds any preconceived expectations."
460,"THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME! ...and worth every penny!!! Ignore any review that says it isn't. Everyone should eat here at least once. Grant Achatz is a genius and experiencing his art first hand is something you can't truly appreciate until you've dined here. Every course will surprise and delight you and the wine pairings enhance each course to a level of perfection that is beyond compare. Of course the service is outstanding, but that is not why you come, you come for the meal of a lifetime. The ultimate highlight is that Grant himself comes out and prepares the final course on your table. If you really appreciate delicious food and watching a truly passionate artist at work, you'll be brought to tears. Bravo Grant!"
461,"A restaurant from the future. From the elaborate entrance, to the way the kitchen is so quiet and well organized you'd think it was an advertisement come to life but when you see and taste the food, you'll be blown away. Various ways of eating things and tasting things in ways you'd think might never be acceptable considering how you're dressed. Downside: It will be hard to go back to eating regular food after experiencing so many sensations with your tongue."
462,"This is truly a dining experience. I am very privileged to have been able to go to Alinea and I feel that my time and money was well worth it. My bf and I did the full 24 course and man was it a lot of food. For those of you who say you are still hungry after, you must have the biggest stomachs ever! I seriously almost could not finish the last 4 courses, but of course I made myself finish because I wanted to try everything and obviously get my money's worth! I would recommend doing the wine pairings. There is nothing better than having great food complimented by an even better wine. I feel that the experience is heightened ten fold. I was very concerned that the place was going to be snooty. It definitely has an aura about it, but I didn't feel out of place there. Everyone around us seemed to be having a good time and you didn't feel like you had to whisper. There were even 2 children next to us about ages 11 and 13 who were on their best behavior but seemed to be having a great time. I guess kids aren't normal there, but it was great to see that people feel comfortable enough to bring them. The whole experience was truly mesmerizing. I would want to come back, but it's hard to say when and if I will ever do it. Maybe for a very special evening out. The price really puts a damper on the repeated visits, but I definitely think that if you enjoy food, wine and ambiance, then you need to come here at least once. *They have recently raised their prices, which is a bummer. **I've added a few pictures of some of the courses."
463,"I was really excited to eat at Alinea but I was sorely disappointed. I thought the food was awful, some of the dishes were completely tasteless. The first course ""Rose""... a combination of rose petals and foam and celery or something equally as unappetizing. I kept looking around me and watching other couples act as if this stuff was the most amazing food they ever ate.. I thought I must be in a crazy house?? What phonies... Plus the price is absolutely ridiculous. The waiter service was good, I'll give them that but otherwise... I mean the desserts? A piece of caramelized bacon suspended from a little bow (and arrow) contraption... or the straw where you suck a milkshake out? It tasked like nothing and was a gross texture. Honestly, people must be kidding themselves."
464,"Dinner at Alinea was delicious. I can't even describe how good the food and wines were. I can't say that I loved every course, but I sure walked away from dinner thinking about how to work some of those Alinea flavors into my dishes at home. One thing I'll say- I'm not sure that kind of food is really for me; the ""gastro-pub"" type food. I try to go out of my way to eat whole foods, and all that manipulation didn't really go over very well with my body. The food at Alinea was amazing, the flavors were stunning, and every bite surprised. But for me- well, to put it delicately, my body couldn't really process the food. It actually made me pretty sick. Which, was kind of a buzz kill. That said, I'm so glad we went. It's something I've always daydreamed about, and the experience met all of my (very high) expectations."
465,"You have to understand, I'm not a pretentious foodie, but I can appreciate the flair and visual appeal of a meal. Honestly, I wasn't a fan. The courses were small and lacking in diversity. Too much time spent on presentation. I left still hungry. My recommendation would be to head down a few blocks to Charlier Trotters or give TRU a shot."
466,"You need to eat here at least once. It's certainly not cheap (two people doing the 24-course tour with wine pairing and tip is like $900), but absolutely worth it. As Chicagoans, we have a rare opportunity to benefit from Chef Achatz's leadersip in the world of ""molecular gastronomy"". Definitely don't miss out. I'm glad we didn't. Although it will ruin some of the surprise, you can get a sense for how unique your night will be by checking out flickr photos of the food: http://flickr.com/search"
467,"Simply Fantastic! More than just a must...a necessity in your lifetime. I've had the pleasure of enjoying the Tour (23 courses) on 2 separate visits to Chicago. The dining experience at Alinea is absolutely amazing. the FOOD: is beyond words. the combination of flavors, and the delivery of those flavors is truly masterful...beyond imagination. the PRESENTATION: is simplistic & beautiful. between your larger plated courses are a mix of smaller tastes on the most interesting contraptions. the serving apparatuses are just as fascinating as the morsels on them. the PRICE: is not cheap...but WELL worth it. the SERVICE: is great. very polite & attentive, not overbearing or snooty. exactly what you expect at this price point. As a food-photo maniac, it was disappointing that they DO NOT allow flash photography, my 1st experience was a photo bust, BUT the 2nd time I was prepared with my adjusted settings & got great photos! ALSO! when you do the tour, they give you a little souvenir of your gastronomical journey; a description of each course you enjoyed & the date you enjoyed it."
468,Worth the price and wait if you have to it is a once in a lifetime experience! Grant is the best!
469,"If you search reviews of Alinea, ""unforgettable"" and ""experience"" may be the most popular terms. In fact, Alinea is both unforgettable and an experience. Have you ever wondered what it might have felt like to be Lewis Carroll's Alice? After walking into an empty hallway and happening upon the dining room, you are sent down a rabbit hole of gastronomic delight that leaves one in fits. Between a constant sense of awe (once my friend and I got over the awkwardness of what an affair dining at Alinea is -- tables of serious, serious people and equally serious servers) and an incredulity at the number of dishes presented (""We have FOURTEEN more dishes left?""), delirium is delivered in heavy doses. But you will eat, and you will be surprised, and you will be sated. And somehow, like Alice, you will find your way home, and you will be forever changed -- for the better."
470,"I give this place 5 stars for what kind of place it is, because it does what a lot of places are trying to be, but is the only one that succeeds. That being said... I can't imagine I'll ever be back...it's def a culinary, once in a lifetime experience that I don't see multiple visits being necessary, nor do I have much desire to go back. It for sure delivers on service, presentation, and taste, and is an incredible experience. The one thing I missed was that there were minimal greens...I am such a vegetable person and it was very heavy on potatoes. I recommend the tasting menu and doing the wine pairing. The sommelier had great tidbits to tell about the history of each kind of alcohol served, and added to the experience. Not a place for someone who isn't open-minded about food, because there are definitely some unique tastes..."
471,"Not much I can add to the ~300 reviews already. One of the finest dining experiences I've ever had. The aromatic additions to several of the dishes were different, surprising, and honestly amazing (fresh heated rosemary, burnt oak leaves, vaporized nutmeg, etc). Lives up to the hype, go if you love food."
472,"Came here for my birthday this year and holy smokes the best Vegetarian presentation and food I've had. Overall everything was amazing, the final bill was a bit higher than we thought but it was so worth it. I am actually waiting for their menu to change so we can go back."
473,"Let me just say, I owe you a couple reviews Alinea... Having recently dined here a second time, I must say this is, by far, the best restaurant experience ever. Not only is the food amazing, in an interesting and tantalizing kind of way, the service is impeccable, as is the presentation. This is a place that is completely deserving of the accolades it receives. Keep up the amazing work Grant! It's a gem in the midst of many sub-par restaurants out there...your hard work shows and you truly have set the standard by which others are judged. DO NOT miss experiencing this place at least once in your lifetime!"
474,"Well, I am not going to go into all the details, or give my entire menu, since it was a couple years ago, but all I will say is perfection! I went the first week of may 2006, which was Alinea's 1year anniversary week...they only offered the 28course Tour which showcased the best of the previous year...Everything was perfect, the ""high end"" wine pairing was flawless, the 50$ glass of champagne before dinner was excellent...everything...though I mostly remember through the pictures that I took, the one course (probably by far the simplest), is what I always talk about... Made on the custom designed anti-griddle, it was frozen mango puree topped with bonito flakes and 30yr balsamic....MMMM....Droole... anyways 2 people 28 courses each, 5:30pm-11:30pm, tour of the kitchen chat with grant, plus generous tip...$1800 AND WORTH EVERY DAMN PENNY!!!!! see some photos that I will be posting"
475,"I dined here a few months back and just didn't get around to writing the review right away. Anyway, Alinea is outstanding! While it is very expensive (two people, smaller tasting w/ wine pairings and tip = $700) it is well worth it. This is more than a dinner, it is an experience... look at it as a dinner and entertainment (a play for example).... hopefully, this well help justify the price tag and if not, you do get a pillow filled with lavender air to look forward to! The most surprising thing about Alinea was the atmosphere. Although it is very upscale, there were still multiple people photographing there food and laughing out loud... pretty cool that the place could stay so down to earth. Great food, great service, great wine.... a must go for special occasions! Small aside: Watch for the door when you enter building its a crazy looking hallway."
476,Probably the best meal I have ever had. Everything was phenomenal. Loved the wine pairings. The desert was an artistic masterpiece. The service was stellar. Just expect to pay about what you would for a pretty good computer.
477,"this is by far the most creative, original and elaborate meal that i have ever attended. the ingredients were pristinely perfect, the courses impossibly complex and overall highly impressive. the decor reminded me of a super trendy, high-class hotel when we walked in, setting the tone for the impeccable service that followed. so why didn't i give it a 4 and not a 5 with such high praise? simply because although everything was cleanly executed, i didn't feel a personal connection with the food. to me, they never became greater than a sum of its parts. i found the courses cold, sometimes austere, and never encountered anything that made me go yum, i could eat bowls of this stuff. so while i am glad i had the dining experience that was alinea, i'm not sure when or if i would return."
478,"Ok, so i don't think i need to go into details about each course, i mean, its all pretty fantastic. I'm giving 5 stars for the experience itself. If you have the financial means and are looking for a unique and very well done/organized, formal dining experience Alinea would be the place to live it out. My smoke slave and I did the TASTING but I highly recommend the TOUR (the tables on either side of us were indulging in the tour which has many more courses and are even MORE involved and intricate than the tasting)... I guess I was feeling cheap that night. Not only was the ""food"" amazing and presented in a really great way, we were doted on by multiple people-but not in a chaotic/hoovering fashion-from the beginning to the very end (about 2 and a half hours of grazing). And everything we consumed was explained and elaborated on, esp. the wine. So find yourself some dough and go!"
479,"It seems almost excessive to write yet another rave review, but how could I not? This was a perfect evening, with the most incredible menu I have even seen. We spent four and a half hours in heaven. The service was perfect, the wine pairing impeccable. I wouldn't want to go too frequently, it's too special (and, yes, it's expensive, but SO worth it!) If you go, get the Tour. There are too many great things to miss if you don't."
480,"I had been looking forward to my experience at Alinea for, well, as long as I had known it existed. It's is no secret that this place is just a tad expensive so this was probably a once in a lifetime experience for me. Let me just say this to anyone that is debating whether they should pay rent this month or go to Alinea. Go to Alinea. Let me say this again, forget the rent, fast for a month, do whatever it is that you need to do. Go to Alinea. Anyone that has any appreciation for this new and exciting form of food/art will love this place. Working in the kitchen of another world famous establishment just up the road I have had a lot of exposure to incredible food, but this was beyond belief. Chef Achatz's mastery of his craft is truly evident in every dish. His ability to stimulate the palate as well as the imagination is awe inspiring. A final few thoughts: -Go for the Tour menu. It is worth the extra cost. -If it is a special occasion make it known. Trust me. -If you can afford to do so, opt for the wine pairings. It makes the experience go from a 10 to a 15."
481,"I don't remember much because it's been nearly 2 years but all I have to say is that it is GORGEOUS and so delicious. I had a bug in my salad, but I was given a new one immediately and the wait staff was very apologetic. These things happen. And it was a salad. It was fine to me. There was one dish that will never be forgotten. I honestly don't know what it was. It was a dessert and I honestly don't know how to describe it. It looked like it was on some kind of cone and it was definitely brown... cinnamon? I don't know. But we were told to eat it all in one bite and it was the most incredible thing on earth."
482,"Best meal of my life, won't say more because there's plenty said. Regarding previous comment about the wine pairings -- yes, for the 12 course the pairings were mostly whites and only 1 red, but these were some amazing whites. I'm not a big white wine drinker myself, but after this meal I'm going to start exploring whites because the pairings were genius. The aromas were absolutely tantalizing and I almost didn't want to drink because I just wanted to keep inhaling."
483,"I went to this restaurant back in July, i know, i should've written a review a long time ago. Anyways, the food was handsdown amazing! However, our server and the manager were super snobby and super rude. Our server got upset with me and my boyfriend and would talk about how much she didnt like us. I'm assuming she thought we didnt understand english very much, but seriously? The manager was also rude. I'm not usually one to complain about things like that, but this was ridiculous. I had never been to a fancy restaurant like this before, and here these uptight employees managed to make me feel like i shouldn't be dining there. But, like i said, the food was what probably saved me from making a scene. I think i would like to go back....but not anytime soon."
484,"Wow were do I even begin.... Lets start from the entrance.... When you walk thru the front doors you are ""WOW-ed"" by the ambiance of the hallway... Long very modern hall lite up with purple neon. Then you step to a sliding set of doors where you are greeted by the host and hostess who actually greeted us by name...... So far so I'm excited..... We are escorted to our seats only 5 tables on the main floor and an additional 6 on the upper level.... Server seated us and placed napkin on laps... Offered a drink right away.... 2 main servers assisted us the whole night.... One explained the dishes and took care of our every need the other explained the wine menu which was poured during every course..... We had what is called the long menu which ed turned out to be 28 courses in whole.... And we had 13 wine pairings which went with dinner... The Food was awesome a complete experience and the presentations of the dishes ""WOW"" is all I can say... lol which i took pictures of the dishes.... seriously the presentation out of this freaking world..... The dishes covered Octopus, Lobster, Duck, Sturgeon, Goose, Venison, Pork Belly, and then some small interesting flavors..... Honestly I only remember 2 dishes in whole. 1 was called ""Bubble Gum"" which came in what looked like a dime bag of well us your imagination and anyways when you placed in your mouth it exploded with a mind blowing flavor.... IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME.... The 2nd was dessert and well I kid you not the chef comes out at this point and prepares the dessert and seriously the table... A Chocolate experience which again blows your mind not only on presentation but on flavor.... So back to the staff very I found them to be very dry and boring.... Ambiance once seated again very boring nothing special.... This place is all about the food and the wine pairings..... So if you are looking for a serious as my partner would call out food ""mind-fuck"" then this is the place to go.... Dinner did last 4 hours and you need to book your reservation like 3 months in advance.... OH and don't forget we are talking big big big, yes i used the words 3 times bucks for dinner...... Oops I also have to throw in there don't wear white.... some of the food alittle messy.. But if you do they will very discretely bring you a ""shout"" wipe to clean up your cloths...... Yes I'm speaking form experience ...."
485,"For the adventurous foodie, Alinea provides one of the most unique and deliciously entertaining tasting experiences. From the moment you enter the modern unassuming dining room, you're greeted with a friendly staff who delight in presenting your dishes. Each course plays out theatrically in unexpected sensational ways. I hesitated to touch these ""food sculptures"", because they're unlike anything I've seen let alone eaten. But they encourage you to play with your food, explore it's textures and tastes. Whether it was a frozen pea soup that melted in your mouth, or dessert served on a rapidly deflating pillow of Earl Grey essence, you're rewarded simply for participating. The night which began with low key chatter grew livelier as fellow diners shared their dining experiences with the rest of the room. This is perhaps the closest thing to interactive dinner theater, because the enjoyment comes as much from the reveal as it does from the taste."
486,"An unforgettable experience. I have to agree with fellow yelpers - if you're deciding between the tasting and the tour menu, the tasting menu is plenty. Although the tasting menu portion sizes are small, they really add up and both my friend and I left full and happily satiated. The wagyu beef course still haunts me and the creativity of their menu and presentation really makes you see why they're rated #1 in the US this year... happy sigh.."
487,"Everything at Alinea is amazing. Chef Achatz and his staff really know what they're doing when it comes to molecular gastronomy. I had the 12 course tasting menu, and everything was just awesome. A plus side to the food is the service that you get from the wait staff. They truly try to cater to your needs as a patron to their establishment. Even though the bill was heavy, I would definitely go there again."
488,"I doubt my review will help very much given the overwhelming consensus that this is an amazing restaurant (which I share!), but I wanted to add that, when I went a couple of years ago, I and my sister were vegetarian (but not vegan) and they were extremely accommodating. When making the reservation, I told them that there would be two vegetarians, and they said that was completely fine. Our dishes were for the most part similar to the other dishes, but also thoughtfully put together to be a great meal experience without the meat. They even gave us our own separate menus at the end with explanations of the vegetarian dishes. Also, we went with the shorter menu because I thought who can sit in a restaurant for five hours, but then our meal ended up taking five hours anyway. Apparently every time someone leaves the table for even a minute, it can throw off the timing of the dishes and they will remake everything in that course for your table. So the bigger your group, the more likely you will have an extended dining experience!"
489,"What an incredible meal! Alinea rocks in all facets, from service, to food innovation, to check presentation. Exceptional meal, exceptional service. The food is incredibly innovative, which I adore, but some of my less adventurous friends would be sorely disappointed had they joined us. No picking which ingredient you want or don't...it just arrives in perfectly timed & orchestrated intervals throughout the night. And plan on being there for a while...our ""tasting"" of 12 courses took 3 hours for 5 of us. So go with people you like and enjoy talking to! I strongly recommend doing the wine pairing with the meal. Its expertly paired and a really nice addition to the flavors of the food. I wish I could afford to eat there more often ($360 tasting w/ wine pairing + lovely Cook County tax), but I hope to venture back at least once a year. Do it. Savor it. It's a meal you'll cherish for the rest of your life!"
490,"Going to Alinea is a special occasion in itself, however, when I went, it was also for my mother's and aunt's birthday celebration. We were a party of six and it was amazing. I have never had a meal like it - it's true what they say, it's not just amazing food... it is an experience. Here's some of the highlights (I'm to lazy to organize my thoughts into a clever plot line with witty one liners that make sense): - The meal was 5 hrs long with over fifteen courses, it not an experience or meal to be rushed. Sit, enjoy and slow down. - The dessert was so amazing, who knew eating off the table could be so fulfilling - The wine pairings were perfect to the tee.. though i didn't really want to drink that much on Wednesday night (I'm getting old) - Your taste buds will orgasm, your eyes won't believe what you're tasting - My favorite dish was a coffee halibut (what it was really called I don't remember, I simply called it ""white"" at the table) - the flavors so complex and the visual so simple - I ate a nutella sandwich that did not look anything like a nutella sandwich - Although a dish might be a single bite, I was full by the end - I found the staff to be polite and witty - they timed every dish beautifully. I can imagine it wasn't easy for a table of six - If it weren't for the tiny Alinea valet sign, I would have not seen this place - The atmosphere was a little pretentious for my liking, but i guess when your shelling out a couple hundred for a mean it's expected... - It was worth the hype. It made me happy. - I can't get over how fun the dinner was, and complexity/simplicity of every dish. You could really appreciate the work, labor and love put into every master piece of a dish So there it is. My words couldn't do justice to Alinea and to Grant. I am just grateful for the experience, it is one that few truly appreciate and will get to experience."
491,"Absolutely unbelievable. Better food, better atmosphere than Charlie Trotter's. We are still in awes of the entire menu, but especially the black truffle explosion and the presentation of the two desserts. I do not understand how anyone can give Alinea less than 5 stars... PS - My husband did the wine pairing and I just ordered by the glass. Some of the pairings were suberb, but I do not know if I can justify the overall cost of the wine pairings. I ordered by the glass and was satisfied with the recommendations of our sommelier."
492,"Ok, the food was out of this world. BUT, there was ONE, count 'em, ONE woman anywhere in the restaurant beyond the coatroom, and apparently when I asked, there are two on the kitchen/ server staff in total. That means the ENTIRE server staff is male, and most of the kitchen too. They told me its a pretty demanding job, with lots of stairs etc, but I'm sorry, with a place of this caliber, it would not be hard to attract qualified, high quality female personnel who can stand a workout. A large element of the meal is service, with many dramatic courses, and I found the gender imbalance an egregious problem that partly ruined my experience. I'd urge the restaurant to reconsider its hiring practices."
493,"Just a heads-up--you won't get a meal at Alinea--you get an EXPERIENCE. That's really the best way to describe it. Starting from the minute you enter the unmarked double doors, followed by walking down the long hallway lit my warm red lights (reminiscent of a fashion runway) to the hidden door that magically opens as you walk by it (a la Get Smart). And that's just the entrance! You'll be greeted by a warm, knowledgeable, and FRIENDLY staff ready to attend to your every dining whim and answer any of your curiosities. Now, for the food! 20 courses of delight--best 3 1/2 hours of dining I've ever had. First up, a trio of edible ""shots""--Lemon, Apple, and Squash flavors. Then golden trout roe on top of coconut mousse and pineapple foam with a licorice sauce. Next up, a shrimp stick eaten with your hands and dipped in Miso mayo. Right next to it was a take on Vietnamese ""chao tom""--compressed sugar cane flavor + shrimp and mint. Monochromatic ""white dish""--halibut with black pepper (bleached white), vanilla, and lemon. Apple with horseradish and celery juice...in a shot glass...culminating in a liquid explosion in your mouth! Now we get to some really interesting stuff--a rabbit trio (parfait, rillettes, consomm) served in an egg shaped babushka. That means the parfait was on the top layer, the rillettes (with blood sausage) on the middle layer, and the consomm as the bottom layer. A-MA-ZING. Next, I smelled smoke. What is burning?? Ah, the staff bring out burning oak leaves! And somewhere in that mix sits a scrumptious pheasant dumpling with green grape and walnut nestled inside. Now it's time to use our hands to play with food: ravioli skin + short ribs + olives + blackberry + smoked sea salt = the bomb! Next is a shot of cold potato, black truffle, and butter. Following that is a ""pigeonneau""--that's squab prepared foie gras style and resting on top of a puff pastry--DELISH! But my FAVORITE dish of the night had to be the Black Truffle ""explosion"" with hint of romaine and parmesan. Let me tell you, after eating this, everyone at my table took a moment of silence to savor what they just experienced. It was THAT good. No joke. Now that we've worked our way through the savory dishes, it's time to ""warmup"" to dessert by consuming a pineapple and ham infused crisp (tastes like the best Hawaiian pizza you'd have), butterscotch and apple flavored smoked bacon, and a caramel popcorn ""shot"". OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. If that wasn't enough, now on to the REAL dessert: Earl Grey shortbread mixed with lemon curd, pine nuts, and caramelized white chocolate. Bubble Gum ""straw"" with tapioca balls that you suck right out of the straw! To Finish, a fantastic chocolate dish with blueberry, honey, and peanut that just sets the mood right for the end of the night. And to boot, the staff took us on a tour of the 2-story, 3-dining room, space and, of course, I couldn't resist picking up Chef Grant Achatz's cookbook. If you couldn't tell by now, this dining EXPERIENCE blew my mind--the best I've had so far! I can't recommend Aliena enough if you happen to be in Chicago. Or you could do what I did and book your flight to Chicago around a successful reservation to Alinea. Trust me, it's worth every dollar (and you'll spend a lot of dollars here). Alinea does not disappoint. I wish I could eat here every night."
494,"Best restaurant I've ever been to, by far. They do things with food that I did not know were possible. My advice is to go all out and get the full spread with the wine pairings. It is a total waste to go here and not do the wine, so don't be cheap."
495,"A cavalcade of playful, witty, strange and delicious food. The meal was exactly what I expected of Alinea, playful bites, and masterfully thought out presentation. Top notch service and impeccable wine pairings. Once in a lifetime experience, worth every penny (and it cost a lot of those!)"
496,"We went here for our 1st year anniversary. This was definitely thematic to celebrate our 1st year ""journey"" through life and the journey we went through with the Tour menu and the wine paring. As with any journey in life, you experience the same emotions with the Tour...surprised, pure ecstasy, shocked, delighted, humbled, flabbergasted, laughing (especially when you experience something completely unexpected in your mouth), satisfied, maybe in tears (when its over and you have to pay the bill). If you could experience a lifetime of emotions in 5 hours, wouldn't you want to understand how food could do that to you?!?! I know...weird that food can do that to a person, but that's the only way I can express how extraordinary Alinea is."
497,"Easily the best restaurant I've ever been to. 16 courses of near perfection. Great service if not a bit uncomfortable in the beginning. The only issue i have is that they do not have a full bar, the only liquor they offer is for after dinner. Remember you will spend around $200 to $260 per person before beer or wine."
498,"First time there? Yes Will I go back again? Yes, we're already planning. I went with one of my friends and his wife- They've been 3 times so far. We had 2 bottles Billecart Salmon Champagne and the reserved wine pairing with dinner. It was excellent. There is nothing I could write that would do justice to the food and experience. Just go.. I flew in Saturday from San Diego for dinner and left the next morning. Well worth the time and experience."
499,"Just got back from dining at Aliena...most amazing dinner I have ever experience...from start to finish.....the best part was the dessert,only because you get to have the chef present it....if you ever want a dining experience you have to try Aliena....."
500,"My girlfriend and I had been planning on going here for years to celebrate a special occasion, mainly a new job. Sort of a competition of who would get the big one first. Well, she beat me and landed a great job in New York, which unfortunately meant we had to leave Chicago, but I had to pay up. So I took her to Alinea under this guise, and without her knowing I planned to ask her to marry me as well. Needless to say dinner was amazing, especially the ring course. She said yes."
501,"It pains me to say this... but Alinea was a disappointment. My boyfriend and I looked forward to our anniversary dinner here for months, and when the Michelin Guide ratings were announced, it only fueled our curiosity and excitement. To start, I have to say I was pretty disappointed in the appearance of Alinea. It's somewhat chic but very plain--some minimalist, modern decor and overall a ""clean"" look--but frankly, quite boring. I'm not asking for Trump styling, but I do think that even to achieve a modern/sleek look they could have put some more effort into it. The ambiance just wasn't at all what I expected... not bad, just kind of lame. I looked past this and remained excited for the meal. With the buzz about this place, and the price tag, I expected to be BLOWN AWAY. Instead, I found most of the dishes odd, salty, and just... not yummy. The savory dishes and elements were salty and had strong, mismatched flavors... I especially did not like the rabbit consumme--I could barely get it down the hatch (though I did try, since it was so expensive!). The pineapple ""sheet"" and foams didn't even taste sweet... just odd. I felt like I was eating from a high school chemistry experiment, not a top-rated restaurant. I will say, however, that the service was excellent. The waiters were attentive and not pretentious (which might be expected). Also, there were a couple of dishes I did enjoy... the short rib ravioli was excellent, the bubble gum/creme fraiche dessert was interesting, and the final chocolate dessert course was very good. I also have to give points for creativity and the presentation, which was exceptional. But overall, the tiny portions and odd flavors did not thrill me in the least. I have had many fine dining experiences in Chicago that have exceeded this one... and I hate to keep bringing up the price (I am more than happy to shell out big bucks for worthwhile experiences), but here it was just not commensurate with the experience. I am glad I tried it, but I would not go back (unless the menu changes and I find a wealthy benefactor)."
502,"Now this is a place that writing a review is almost unnessesary. It goes without saying that the concept of food has been taken to a new level. Maybe if you visited Spain and saw one of the new concept resturaunts you would have something to compare it to. MOTO is a shadow of Alinea, a strong shadow, but a shadow none the less. What can I tell you about this place. You must be a foodie to enjoy it. You must be willing to submit to the will of the chef, his architect, his lighting designer, his artist who hand crafted the plates and utensils to accompany and harmonize with the food. This is food taken to the hieghts of showmanship, you have light, you have smell, you have touch, texture, imagination, you get it. What you also have to be ready for is the concept that price is no object. If you have to look at the bill dont come, you will be disappointed. If you are prepared to treat yourself and damn the recession than full speed ahead."
503,"So last year around this time.. I was planning a trip for our 8 yr anniversary... since I hadn't been to Chicago in awhile, I decided this is were would would go. So I get on the trusty ole' computer and sign on to my faithful YELP.COM... I look up the Chicago sight, and BAM! at the top of the list... Alinea. I read several reviews and I am sold! I get on the phone and make a reservation, about a month and half away from our anniversary I was fortunate enough that they have an opening the day prior to our anniversary, so take it, these guys are booked solid, can't pass up this opportunity, right? I pretty much have the trip planned, this is going to be a foodie journey, Alinea, Moto,Blackbird, Avec, Burt's Place, Perry's, Silver Palm, Super Doug's and then fly back home.... so Alinea is first, the plan is to fly out the morning of the reservation, get to the hotel freshen up relax and get ready for our special evening, we can hardly wait.... So the morning of our departure... we wake up late and miss our 6:30AM flight... okay let's not freak out... we'll standby hopefully we can get on the next one... 10am... nope, 12pm... nope...2pm...:(... 4pm... announcement ""next three flights to Chicago are canceled!!!!!"" WHAT!!! We have no choice but call the restaurant and cancel our special anniversary dinner :(... they are booked solid for the next three days that we'll be in town...we get a new flight for the next morning same time...and figure oh well maybe next time... So we arrive on time and fly out... we arrive relax for awhile, walk downtown go to Perry's for an awesome Pastrami sandwich, and my wife makes the obligatory trek to H&M.... while we're there I get a call from Alinea... they've had a cancellation for 6:30pm tonight... it's 3:30, I say YES, and drag my wife out of the store and hurry back to the hotel so she can take her mandatory 2 hrs to get ready journey....finally we make it! (had to cancel reservations at Avec, but reschedule for lunch the next day.) So we arrive at the brownstone building with really nothing to identify it as Alinea, other than a valet guy right outside... we walk in to Star Ship Enterprise's walkway... I have no idea where I'm going, LOL we walk a few steps and a door to the left opens, we are greeted by name at the door by the hostess and follow her to our table, a bottle of wine is waiting for us as I had this arranged earlier. Let the experience commence.... English Pea, Shad Roe, distillation of thai flavors, Pork Belly, Sturgeon, King Crab, Duck, Hot Potato, Tournedo, Black Truffle, Earl Grey, Chocolate... and bubblegum... our menu.... AMAZING. The best meal I have ever EXPERIENCED, not had, EXPERIENCED! Don't think there is anything else I can say..... I will say this... I can't believe it took me soo long to write my review, I almost feel ashamed, but I did it because after watching Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods this past week, and seeing him experience what we did when went, it's as if I relived the entire experience again. The words he used to describe this place were 1000% exact. Everyone must try Alinea."
504,"Obviously, Alinea doesn't need another glowing review...but.....I mean....!!!! The whole event was beyond, from walking in the doors to eating desert off the table. I was smiling the whole (4 hour!) dinner. It was such a beautiful, inspiring experience. Thank you Alinea!"
505,"Amazing food, but the experience left me wanting. This place has to be experienced once for the food alone. I guess that is the most important thing but the overall experience for us was a little flat. We were seated in the front room on the street level and that may have been the issue. It was a tiny room with 3 or 4 tables with no atmosphere at all. Also since it was so quiet and everyone was having the same menu we kept hearing each item described 4 times (at each table). The whole thing was just odd. Also our server had no personality whatsoever. Anyway, like I said the food was amazing and I am glad I went."
506,"The restaurant remind me of Kejserens nye klder (Emperor's new clothes) I was very excited to dine at Alinea but I was extremely disappointed... It was one of the worst dining experience I ever had. I cannot express how awful it was in words but I'll try 1. The restaurant suggests formal attire (Jacket / no jeans) however their atmosphere did not match the dress requirements. It was very casual in a bad way. When the hostess took us to our table, I asked her if we were at a waiting room / cocktail room before getting moved to the main dining room, but it was our actual table to experience our Tour - 24 courses. I also noticed that because of the way the tables were set up and bad ventilation, I could smell everyone else's food in the dining room. 2. The chef added emphasized elements of scents to some of the dishes which were overpowering and not well composed. For example, he put a full branch of mint in an outer bowl of a dish and the server poured hot water on top of it at the table side. The mint scent was so strong and overwhelming that it not only destroyed the great soup but also lingered through the next 3 courses served. I could also smell the mint every time someone else in the room received the dish. I could smell the mint before the hot water was poured, I do not understand why he wanted such a strong sent with a dish. I saw the chef Grant Achatz speaking about importance of scent on video. (http://videos.howstuffwo) 3. The chef put more effort to create a dish which is ""different"" than ""great tasting"". Yes some of the dishes such as Ice Fish were beautifully presented, but flavor composition and balance did not follow the beauty. I believe importance of proportion and balance of ingredients comes before plate presentation. In this dish a lot of mayonnaise was used as glue to make the dried fish stand up. The Mayonnaise's rich taste was so overpowering that it killed other taste components of the dish. Also for the wagyu dish, a thinly sliced (shabushabu thickness) beef was frozen by liquid nitrogen then hung on a wire until defrosted and cooked on top of the warm black truffle / potato. I asked our server that other than the appearance, what does freezing the beef add to this dish. He said it was just a presentation for us to enjoy watching the beautiful beef melt and change appearance... Freezing meat usually let moisture out of the cells thus make beef dehydrated. I cannot see any good reason to freeze wonderful wagyu beef for just appearance... 4. Some dishes such as Bacon which was hanging on a wire were inedible. I understand why the chef coated bacon by butterscotch for this dish. Fattiness and saltiness DO go with sweetness (same idea as fois gras with fruit compote, duck confit with balsamic reduction, or honey baked ham...) but the balance is the key.. This dish was overly sweet and fatty, it was inedible. 5. Some of the guests were unacceptably loud and obnoxious. They were talking to us and other guests over other tables. We were minding our own business, but few other guests were drunk and yelled at us inappropriately several times. For example, our server presented a skewered dish served on a freestanding wire and told us to eat it without using hands. The male guests on the next table shouted ""I wanna see you eat it"" (eating it with our mouth wide open without using hands / resembling a sexual act). The dining environment was extremely uncomfortable so I asked our server if it was always same at the restaurant where the entire guests talk to each other. His answer was ""our guest enjoy lively atmosphere and even Wolfgang Pack is eating with us tonight."" The guests kept talking to each other over our table during whole dinner. I enjoyed neither the food nor the atmosphere. We told our servers to stop bringing last few courses. We left the restaurant without eating last 3 courses, paid for the entire ""Tour"", left over 15% tip and went out of the restaurant. To be objective, Visual presentation: 4.3 / 5 points Innovativeness of dishes 5 / 5 points Quality of ingredients 4.2 / 5 points Scent 1 / 5 points Taste of each component in a dish 2.8 / 5 points Composition of flavor for the each dish 1.5 / 5 points Flow of the courses 2 / 5 points Wine (independently from food) 5 / 5 points Wine choices (paired with each dishes) 3.2 / 5 points Server's knowledge of food and wine) 3.9 / 5 points Service (servers' customer service skills) 1.8 / 5 point Atmosphere 1.4 / 5 points Bottom line, I will not dine at Alinea even though they were at $40 per person (at 1/10 of the price point). *To clarify the questions by Matthew M I differentiate stars / overall experience from the points above 1 = never go back 2 = go back if there is a special event I have to attend 3 = go back if convenient 4 = go back 5 = arrange a special trip"
507,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical and cynical when I agreed to go to Alinea with a few friends. I love food. I really love food. I really, really, REALLY love food. But I have shied away from the stratospherically expensive places because I have been let down one too many times. At supposedly outstanding places, I've experienced missteps that convinced me that there is definitely a point of diminishing returns. So, I tempered my expectations and figured that I would give this molecular gastronomy, modernist cuisine, or whatever label you would like to use, a try. This is not a relaxing place to eat, per se. There is no music, the dining rooms are spare (probably because the food is truly the star of the show), and it's a little weird feeling that the staff is literally listening to everything we say and taking notes on it in a little black book. Everyone was extremely friendly and professional, however, even when the flash on my camera went off accidentally. I am generally a fan of warmer service, but I think this type of service matched the restaurant. I heard from one of my friends that on his past visit, the servers were more interactive, so maybe we were just here on a slightly off night. The food itself was mind-blowing, inspiring, thought-provoking, and downright delicious. So many reviews have already been written that I don't need to say much more. I tried my best not to do much research beforehand to preserve the element of surprise, and I'm so glad I did. The surprises are half the fun, for sure. I loved the interactive food-as-art feel. For the amount of ingenuity, creativity, and labor that goes into the food, I think that the nearly $200 price tag is actually a bargain. Yes, a bargain. Never thought I'd say that. Everyone at the table got the wine pairings, and while it was good, it may have been the most disappointing aspect of the meal for me. I was hoping for the ""holy crap"" factor, that lightbulb moment when a food and a wine come together to produce a flavor greater than the sum of its parts. I have experienced a few of these pairings before, some in restaurants, some happy accidents at home. During this meal, I did not experience any of those moments, and if there's one place in the city I would expect one, it's here. So, if I ever go back to Alinea, I'm not sure I would spring for the pairing again. I may prefer to choose my own wine next time. We did some research the next day, and pretty much all the bottles in the pairing are $40-$60 retail. They were all good, but none were stunners. For a table of 4-6 people, one could buy a few bottles of very good wine for significantly less than the 5 of us spent on the pairings. Yes, you do pay for the variety, but I think we could get better wines picking out bottles with the help of a sommelier. Our party of 5 was there for 5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed every second. I loved savoring the different flavors and textures of the components and taking my time picking things apart, then tasting different components together to see their interactions. Yes, it's very expensive, but if you are willing to save up, this is the meal of a lifetime."
508,"Meal of a lifetime? Definitely. This meal is absolutely everything the other reviewers say. We were lucky enough to have Grant Achatz in the kitchen the night we were there, and also come around to make the desserts on the table. My friend and I had wanted to try Alinea for some time and made our reservations about 3 months in advance. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and gives very thorough overviews of all of the food and wine. The ambiance is beautiful without taking the attention from the food. There are enough reviews that highlight the food in a way I could not do it justice, so instead of reviewing that again, I will use my review to recommend reading Grant Achatz's book, ""Life, on the line"" before going, as it tells the story of how the concept of Alinea came about, the history behind the space and the menu, his battle with cancer while he ran the restaurant, and of course, his love of food. It is a quick read, and really helps to make a dinner at Alinea all the more special. Yes, it's an expensive meal, but it is worth it."
509,"Thank goodness for the shot before dinner because it was needed. I almost asked for a second one after the first course. We read all of the reviews before going and were so excited for this dinner. It was the celebration of our 11 year anniversary. We are psychotic foodies and host 10 course multi-course dinners in our home for fun. My husband trained under a master chef for 11 years so we are not idiots when it comes to food. We were both really excited about this meal but have to say that we were sadly disappointed after going. Here is our story. We arrive at 9:30 pm (a great time to have dinner) and are seated and given a shot of I am not sure what but it was a good idea based on what was to follow. The sommelier (looked like he encountered hair dynamite on his way to work ) came out and I just mentioned that I hoped the wine pairings would not consist of a large amount of sweet white wine because we are serious red wine drinkers and this has happened before, He told me that pretty much explained what was about to happen with the wine pairings. He was 12 but had a bossy attitude and was tall for his age and obviously in charge. Anyway we asked if he could substitute some red wine for all of the white wine and he told us he could not. Shocking response for the price they charge. We were told if we wanted to spend additional money on a half bottle of red to get us through we were welcome to. Really, are you kidding me?? (The starting price was about $60 for anything decent. How understanding of them???) The first course was Sturgeon Roe covered with foam and I was seriously disturbed by the textures. Small postules that popped in your mouth and screamed fish more than you would ever want or hope for. One bite and I was done. Actually I was seriously traumatized. They noticed that both of us did not touch the first course and offered to bring us some thing else. Humorouly enough after the dinner we realized that they just brought us the second course, not something additional. Go figure! Hot potato cold potato was amazing thank goodness. The next course was razor neck clams and scallops in a bunch of gelatinous goop with more foam (which I now hate) which could have been good without the creepy slimy textures. So this restaurant is all about textures but it is about bad textures not good textures. The rest of the courses were a mix of creepy slimy mayonnaise like textures. One spoonful is tasty but cups of it become creepy and gross. The highlights were the pork belly and Wagyu beef (amazing and was almost worth the $600 dollar price tag of our dinner) but considering that 9 out of 12 courses were creepy and gross I have to give it 2 stars. Service was good but did not equal Charlie Trotters. The popcorn course was exhausting and contained way too much mayonnaise type goop. I did not get it and after dinner we made a pact to never do another multi course again for the rest of our lives. The dessert course were right out of a weird science fiction movie. We had to suck weird things out of tubes (it did not taste that good by the way) Okay and then we have the bacon on a trapeze. What was up with that? Silly to say the least. These people spent money on a wire contraption to suspend the bacon like it was in traction. The aromatic things were a waste of time. I got yelled at for putting a dirty spoon on the pillow. Summary was we would not go back if you paid us $600 dollars. The decor was boring the food was creepy and the service was basic. For the same money we went to Spiaggia the next night and were blown away. Now that is a restaurant. If I never encounter foam for the rest of life it would be too darn soon. I am not sure why everyone loves this place. Maybe they are not eating enough mayonnaise in their diets are are craving it immensely and that is why they love Ilinea. I cannot figure out how everyone rates this restaurant a 5 because I do not see it. If you agree with this review we would love to hear from you. I did not complain because after Trotters let down I gave up on expensive multicourses and really am over it! P. S. The wine pairings were a joke. I could have gone into their cellar and done an eeny meeny moe picking and come up with better wine pairings. And that really pissed us off! There were only two wine pairings that actually made sense the rest were a joke. So the 12 year old was not very good and needs to go back to wine school and get a hair cut. Yes my husband and I are spoiled brats and make better food in our kitchen every day. If you are a truly serious foodie please do not waste your money on this restaurant!"
510,"You feel special just walking into this unmarked building. The hustle and bustle of the outside world immediately disappears as soon as you step into the dimly-lit hallway that appears to shrink off in the distance (think willy wonka). Two doors slide open and like stepping into the Holodeck on the Enterprise you enter a entirely different environment than the one you just moments ago became accustomed to. I find it difficult calling what happened next a 'meal' as the term simply does not adequately describe an evening at Alinea. It was a perfectly-choreographed event with the story-line being the 18 or so courses laid out in front of us. The attention to detail is astounding, from the smallish separated dining rooms, to the many customized serving vessels, to the chairs that somehow remained comfortable for the duration of the 3 hours we spent there. All the dishes, many a single bite, were so rampant with flavors and textures that I took to pausing a few moments before swallowing to allow the flavors to mix and produce an entirely new element to the dish that I had not experienced just moments before. Taking things slow is a must here. Eat too quickly and you would miss out on the subtle flavors and additions offered by each ingredient. One recurring theme of many of the more substantial courses was that the whole was always greater than the sum of the parts. Flavors that maybe did not amaze on their own combined in a way that elevated all the components involved into one cohesive, unforgettable bite. Some courses were interactive without being annoying. Cutting my own greens off the ""living garden"" centerpiece for the salad course was a strangely satisfying experience. The salad itself was also unreasonably good. My only warning about this place is to have an open mind. This is not the restaurant to go to if you're looking for classical dishes and/or a typical appetizer, entree, dessert progression with large portions. What you will get at Alinea is the food of a gifted culinary artist, presented in ways that will surprise you and challenge your ideas of what food can be."
511,Truly an amazing place. Everything here is so perfect. Too bad my taste buds aren't that great like professionals. We did 9 course with wine pairing. Very pricey but why not try this place at least once in life time?
512,"My palate can't distinguish between Michelin 2 star vs. 3 star cuisine, but I love alinea anyways. I went for the tour the first time in February 2008 for the one-year anniversary with boyfriend, and again in May 2008 for alinea's 3 year anniversary. Those who think of it as solely a meal are the ones who miss out on the nuances, and take away nothing but a four hour dinner. No - this is performance art, at its finest - edible. There are some unconventional presentations they repeat and alter the composition of: a dish with a waxy ball of some juice that explodes in your mouth, a ""shot"" glass of a mixture, food on a thin wire that involves no hands, a bowl of rich soup that can't be put down until you finish, with a biteful of something that complements on top, a silver pick, etc. It's hard to review all the dishes in one meal, let alone two, in 5000 characters, so I'm just going to review the memorable ones: bad and good. Chicken Skin: truffle, corn, thyme. A one biter, yet underwhelming - texture, flavor, none of it was there. They should take this off, because it felt like an afterthought to me. Sweetbread: cauliflower, burnt bread, toasted hay. I have the utmost respect for Chef Grant, but this dish hit a sour note for me. I hated the hard/crunchy cauliflower. There were these tan and black dots adorning a ""village"" that tasted terrible and enhanced the awfulness of everything else. Presentation was cute, but this dish's flavors and textures stunk with me. Transparency of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt: Tasted like potpourri with the texture of baked saran wrap. not my favorite, obviously. But 3 bad dishes out of 52? Not bad. As for the great dishes: Beans: many garnishes, pillow of nutmeg air. This included a marshmallow and fruit leather, centered around a navy bean puree which was topped with pancetta and a guinness beer foam. Unforgettably rich. Roasted pear: foie gras, candied fennel, sweet spices. It was like a ""cover"" of foie over a buttery soup, and they poured more hot soup to melt it. The tastes were totally harmonious. I've only ever had foie fresh at the foire du paris and so i'm picky about my foie, but I loved this. Caramel corn: *liquified*. Our server's presentation: ""well this is intermission, and what do you get at intermission? caramel corn!"" I'd heard bad things (weird, caramel corn shouldn't be liquified, etc.) It was lovely, smooth and tasted exactly like caramel corn, but the aftertaste was great - not buttery or gross, just faint and light. Wagyu Beef: black trumpets, cedar branch aroma. This bite of beef was SO amazing - I'd fly to Japan for it. Boyfriend insisted that the beans were still his favorite, but when I pointed out it was merely a quantity comparison (i.e. if he had less of the beans and more of the beef) he acknowledged I was right. Ice fish: shellfish, horseradish, parsley. One of my favorites, with fried ice fish (japanese delicacy) sticking up out of a custard of shellfish and horseradish (not at all spicy, very very good) with fried potato - like fish and chips except 34280785723094582 times better. Short rib: guinness, peanut, fried broccoli. Imagine a sheet of guinness - even without it, the braised short rib was amazing. Fava beans: lavender, banana, pecorino - i didn't love this so much as the BACON DONUT that came with it, good lord almighty. Lobster: peas, ramps, mint vapor. This might have been my absolute favorite had it not been for the slightly overwhelming peppermint/spearmint smell. Yet it was ridiculously tasty. Strawberry: violet, nicoise olive. holy gizmo, quite literally. An everlasting gobstopper mixed with ""willywonka"" technique of the gum that changed flavors in your mouth. I don't even like olives but it was delicious and the layers melded together beautifully. Hot Potato: Cold Potato, black truffle, butter. The server came out and I recognized it from pictures online. ""OOOH it's the potato"" he laughed, ""yes!"" This is such a signature dish and after tasting it, I know why. One of those few duets that complement each other in every way possible. Temperature, texture, taste - all kicked ass, and the parmesan cubes were wonderful. Chocolate: egg, pomelo, smoke. Our favorite dessert, hands down. a pool of pomelo, some valhrona chocolate infused with tea, a chocolate brioche bridge, a funky chocolate covered egg and smoke gel. With 20+ dishes being served at a meal, a few may not strike your palate perfectly, but it's definitely worth the trip. Chef G and Co. mess with tastes in completely unconventional ways and it is incredibly fun."
513,"Alinea is amazing, awesome, astounding, architectural... I am a Grant Achatz groupie for life now. As much of a luxury as it was, once in a lifetime does not feel like enough. While Alinea is sumptuous it also feels familiar and comforting and I just want more! The whole whimsical experience is equal parts visual and gustative. Truly a unique experience that provides a reminder about how much fun food and especially eating can be."
514,"I am sorry, i know one star is harsh, but this is the second most expensive restaurant that I have ever been to (behind per se) and therefore, it needs to be judged in that context. The food is sublime, there is no question about that. The tastes are very interesting and unique so the 20 courses leave you completely satisfied. Here is why I have give Alinea low marks: 1. Atmosphere. The tables are very close together and there is no ambient noise. the waiters all speak in hush tones and you can pick up conversations from across the room. I was a bit annoyed that I couldn't have a candid conversation with my wife while enjoying dinner. Furthermore, since the meal is broken into 20 micro courses, there is someone at your table nearly every 5 minutes delivering a monolog about the food. If you go to Alinea, prepare more for Theatre than for dinner. It isn't about the company. 2. It gets old...fast: So much about this restaurant is about the presentation and the uniqueness of the food. Each course is delivered by a chef or waiter that is responsible for just that portion of the meal. He gives a presentation about the food and describes how it was intended that you eat it. Here is the problem, it sort of takes away from the night when you hear this same speech 4 or 5 different times during the night as it is given to the adjacent tables. Since it is given by the same person, and exactly the same way, it starts feeling a bit like you are watching robots at work in a perverse culinary chorus. 3. Presentation felt Kitchy: the food is amazing, but some of the dishes require you to obey instructions about how to eat it and how to hold it...ok, not terminal, but it also got a bit old. 4. Timeshare sale: The wine pairing was very good BUT BUT BUT I really HATED the fact that about halfway through the pairing the Sommelier comes over and asks you if you are interested in upgrading to a ""reserve set"" of wines for the balance of the dinner. My reaction may have been unfounded, but I was insulted. To me, this stunk of a ""timeshare sales pitch"" after you have agreed to rent the room for the weekend. The timing just feels horrendous and it begs you to wonder if they don't put it at this point in the dinner to capitalize on the fact that you have already consumed a good deal of wine and that perhaps your judgment is at risk. If you compound this with the fact THAT EVERYONE NEAR YOU IS LISTENING TO YOUR ANSWER, this solicitation is just outright obnoxious. 5. The Sommelier was a moron: An halfway decent Sommelier at a normal fine-dining establishment would have realized that I am a rank amateur when it comes to wine and catered his speech to the unfortunate audience that he is stuck with. At Alinea, even the Sommelier says EXACTLY THE SAME SPEECH TO EACH TABLE WITH EACH GLASS OF WINE. He kept on asking me if I was familiar with certain exotic grapes, because that grape was somewhat similar to the grape I was about to enjoy. Dude, this was irritating. 6. Oh yeah, the menthol. It really was unfortunate. I had read about it in the reviews and I considered asking them to leave it out... but once you are in your seat you realize that you would no more ask them to change a dish than you might ask an actor in a Broadway play to change his pronunciation."
515,"Ate here last week, writing about how great the food and experience will do no justice. The only thing I'll add is the service here justifies why you add gratuity for great service and moving forward not adding gratuity for non existent service!"
516,"With its 125 reviews already, I'm not sure I can add much of anything, but I knew I had to save my 200th review for a special place, so here it goes... I took my boyfriend here last night as a surprise gift for his birthday and a celebration of his landing a new job. I think the surprise was well received :) Although I'm hesitant to put it this way, I will anyway: Alinea might be compared to a really mind blowing one night stand on some exotic vacation. Ok I've never had a one night stand, let alone anywhere exotic. But here's what I mean- its a marathon of indulgence, its an experience like you've never had before - one that might make you feel like no other restaurant will be able to excite you in the same way. And yet there's a good chance you won't feel the need to experience it again. Ok maybe that analogy is a complete stretch. I was afraid that the high expectations set by the 125 other reviews here left room only for at least some disappointment. But it truly was worth every penny and every second of that 4 and a half hours (for the 24 courses)- its an experience that I'll never forget. Every part of it was crafted to perfection- including the name! The service is impeccable. There is no hint of snootiness here. The sommelier made excellent suggestions (even on the low end of the price spectrum). I had my doubts, but you really will not feel the 4-5 hours go by- Alinea keeps you entertained with each dish that comes out to you, not one on a plain old dinner plate. Some suggestions. First, if I did it over again, I might lay off the wine. There is so much going on with the food - I understand that they have wine pairings to bring out the flavors (we didn't end up doing that but ordered by the half/full bottle instead), but I didn't think it was necessary in the end. On top of that, be aware that much of the food is very rich, and if you're not used to eating the kinds of things on the menu, your stomach might be unhappy with you (I can't fault Alinea for this, but I'm still fighting off a bit of nausea). So if you're a novice like me, its probably better to stick with 12 courses, at least for your first time. (I just figured it was now or never for trying a 24 course meal!) I'm not going to say I loved every dish or would crave anything in particular again- most of it was too intense for more than the little servings provided. But some of the highlights to me: the Yuba, Hot Potato, Fava Beans (a bit overwhelming), Chicken Skin (I think- now the dishes are getting mixed up in my head!), and Ice Fish. I'll have to go back and look at the commemorative menu because the online menu looks different than what we had. (I sort of feel like we should have earned a disploma too!) If you have the means, this is something you really must do in Chicago- there are probably not too many things in this city that can boast being one of the best in the world!"
517,"My husband and I ate here the other night, and we were not disappointed. What a great experience! It definitely lived up to the hype. The service was warm, friendly and very welcoming. The food was fun, complex and delicious. The sommelier was knowledgeable and easy to talk to (unlike some snooty sommelier's I've encountered at other restaurants). Capping off a great evening was Chef Achatz himself creating his work of art dessert on our table-top. Was I starstruck? Absolutely. Will I be coming back sometime soon? You bet!"
518,Food: 10*'s Service: 10*'s side note: started off a tiny wee bit bumpy but eased up and became spectacular Ambience: 10*'s Chef and staff- thank you for you dedication to this industry. It was an honor to be taken care of by you all. I had my menu signed by the entire kitchen staff (I asked that the porters sign as well)-- I will frame it and hang it proudly in NYC.
519,"Absolutly the best! it took three months for us to make a reservation however this was one of the best dining experiences we have had in any country. The cources were creative, amazing, fresh and mindblowing!!! This was a culinary art in action. The reserve wine pairing was just amazing. You must try this resturant at least once."
520,"What does one say about this restaurant that would be neither superlative nor duplicative? The words ""perfect"", ""sublime"", ""delight"", and ""heavenly"" all come to mind. But how does one truly describe a concept restaurant that conquers where others have failed or soars where others have become stale? I think the only way this restaurant can be adequately described is to discuss its wunderkind, Grant Achatz. Just over five months ago, Achatz was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Stage four mouth cancer at that. And even if he survived the illness, there was a great chance that he might lose his sense of taste. Comparisons were instantly made to Beethoven, but one could sense writers and compatriots where grasping at hope and praying just for survival. This past Thursday, I received a call from the restaurant to confirm Allie, her parents, and my reservation at Alinea. After we had discussed the typical issues (confirmation, special requests, food allergies, etc.), I asked the caller about Chef Achatz's health. I was prepared to receive a somewhat snide comment about the Chef's health being private or something similar. Instead, the caller thanked me. Thanked me for asking. And mentioned a press release which was put forth by the restaurant the previous week. In the release, which the caller mentioned, the restaurant and Achatz finished with Achatz's own personal motto: ""Onward."" So there I stood, preparing to leave the restaurant on Saturday night, prepared to receive my coat from the front-of-the-house staff, when I looked into the kitchen. Allie's parents were wondering who Chef G was, when I saw him. Anyone who has been in or around restaurants can pick out the truly special chefs when they see them. There is an aura to them. Some have an air of power; others are manic; others are barking orders. While I haven't seen too many great chefs in action, I knew Chef Achatz immediately. He was the one who was moving slowly between the tables, with an air of infinite calmness and purpose. A man who had risen to the pinnacle of his profession only to be told he may die. A man who had seen an empire rise only to hear prognostications that it may crumble as fast. A man that had seen the end and knew that the dish he prepared or conceived of that night was not as important as other things. He had a wisdom in his movement that is not often seen among the young and even less seen amongst the uber-successful young. He was a man, frankly, who had done more in the past 3 years than many do in 70-year lifetimes. And despite his success and the money that he likely has (and further the opportunity he likely had to walk away from it all), there he stood. Tenderly placing a sauce on his dish or preparing a foam for another dish. Intensely calm. Striving onward. To Chef Achatz, five stars are insufficient to truly describe your efforts in Alinea. But despite the perfection you have created, you strive onward. And for that, like your staff so graciously stated, I say thank you."
521,"Wow. It might seem hard to justify spending nearly $700 for a 4 hour experience for two that doesn't put you at risk of jail time, but Alinea manages to do it and leave you craving for more. We had the 24 course meal and lost count after 6 as our taste buds drifted off into a post-coital bliss... only to perk up again when the next culinary invention was placed before our astounded eyes. And the next, and the next. It's truly a never-ending parade of little gastronomic orgasms that words cannot do justice to, and must be experienced to be understood. The service was impeccable, and while I resented the hard sell on wine pairings at first, I came to quickly realize that it really did complete the meal, and I'm glad I buckled to their overtures."
522,"This place is for the nouveau riche... Plainly and simply the most pretentious excuse for dining I've ever experienced. I'm not quite sure what all the raving over this place is about... is it a status thing, to say that you've dined there? The only thing I really enjoyed about the experience was the service and the atmosphere. Yes, the preparation and presentation of the dishes are creative and unique, but I'm still missing something, something I really don't care all that much to get."
523,"Unique dining experience mixing art with food: in the decor as well as the actual meal. Tiny bites but big flavors. 4.5 stars. Was holding out on this last Chicago one for my 500th review of my first 15 months as a yelper. 8-) Cost to worth it rating: 3 (~$300/person for 12 course tasting menu, wine pairing, and gratuity) Eve award: best version of A1 sauce. Pics: http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Highlights: - Atmosphere: upon arriving at the location, the experience begins. The actual door is a bit hard to find, then you walk down a pink lit short hall with no sign of an entrance, only to have the elevator-like doors to the left automatically open up. Part Willy Wonka, part Sci-Fi, and part modern art... kinda like the cuisine. Dining room is very minimalistic, set up as the canvas for the food to come. - Instruction: it's a step away from the norm when you receive verbal instructions on how to eat the dish when you're presented with each course. Ex. eat the spoon of Thai flavored jelly and then the rest of the plate, pull these things off the pin and let it drop before eating, suck in the cigar shaped tube with 3 layers of gelatin substances to taste like bubblegum, open wide and shoot a big hard-shelled white circle filled with fluid, etc. - Scent: a few plays on this sense in the aroma within the slowly deflating lilac pillow our plate was sitting on top of to the mysterious black vase which later spouted out smoke volcano style that provided the essence of a backyard grill. - Steak and potatoes: their version was one of the highlights. A small piece of succulent wagyu beef paired with a pureed potato encrusted in salt and vinegar potato chips. The fun here besides the bbq smoke was the deconstructed A1 sauce: they took all the random ingredients that make up this iconic steak sauce and reverse engineered it to recreate it in powder form and presented it in a plastic pouch. This was freaking cool. - Bacon: slimmest crispiest piece of bacon I've ever had with a touch of sweetness from butterscotch and a sliver of apple tied around it, all presented hanging off of a silver arch we pulled it off of. - Butter: dish highlighting Paula Dean's best friend. Lobster and popcorn with a jelly cube of enclosed clarified butter. - Sweet potato: brown sugar cinnamon crispy exterior reminiscent of that fried taro semi-spiny looking ball at dim sum covered the potato on a stick. My favorite sweet. - Coconut bread: of the 3 breads we tried, this was by far the best. Toast with a bit of coconutty sweetness. - Pork belly: I've never had it before and was a bit scared but the taste was part bacon and part pulled pork. This was surrounded in a Thai curry sauce and eaten after the spoon of Thai flavors of fish sauce, lemon grass, etc. in a clear jelly format. - Pepper ice cream: I liked ground pepper so this worked for me--even when paired with asparagus. - Wine: great pairings but even better was the extent of the description that accompanied each pour. Not only did you get the varietal and producer but region and story behind it all. As a wine-lover, I dug this. La Sirena syrah was incredible... the famous winemaker that has received a perfect 100 point from Robert Parker in previous creations and this particular winery is in Napa--yeay! - Comfy seating: we were upstairs and I sat on the booth side of the table that was so soft, luxurious, and comfortable. - Service: lots of help, as a different person seemed to expertly present each course to us. They noticed we came in a cab and without us asking, made sure one was waiting for us at the completion of our meal. - Menu: after you're done, they present you with a printed out menu in a folder (including wine pairings), joking that it's your diploma. I was impressed, as the hub's had his non-seafood items included so it was personalized and not just cookie cutter. Midlights: - Lengthy process: prep yourself for a 3 hour meal even for the half menu of 12 courses. Get comfy and enjoy. 3 courses actually came at the same time which was nice, as we were getting tired half way through even the shorter menu. Lowlights: - After a few tables sat next to us who ordered the full 24 course menu, our main waiter rarely stopped by our table any longer and was more quick to pour our wine and go. - Chocolate dessert: blanket layer of waxy chocolate covering prune, olive, and pine flavors was not for me. Interesting experience to say the least. Took a bit of reflection upon the evening to appreciate the extent of it all, but since it was so memorable and I notice myself telling everyone about it, I'd like to do it all again. :-)"
524,"What a wonderful, memorable experience. Emphasis on the word ""experience."" My palate, nose, hands and eyes were played with throughout the evening and I loved every minute of it. The timing of the courses was spot on. I never had to start looking around searching for my next taste, and I always had a new delicious wine coming just in time (yes, you should do the wine pairing). Will you absolutely love every course? Of course not. Half of the time you probably won't have much to say other than ""interesting..."" But that's the fun."
525,"I just read pretty much all of the reviews that gave Alinea 3 stars and less and not a single one, I feel, really understood what this restaurant is all about. I'm not saying I know exactly what it's about either. I know very little about molecular gastronomy or cooking for that matter. I don't know Chef Achatz personally, I'm not a ""foodie"" and I don't care to be. I'm not rich or spiritual or any of that, I just know that going to Alinea was an experience; an incredible one at that, which I will NEVER forget. Obviously the experience was even more memorable because it was my 2 year anniversary and I have never spent more than $50 dollars on a single meal, but the waiters and the hostess and even Chef Achatz himself made concerted efforts to make our night as pleasant as possible. I'm a vegetarian, on top of that I am also an EXTREMELY picky eater. But when you make a reservation at Alinea, the scheduler asks if there are dietary restrictions, most people just say ""no meat"" or ""no gluten"" My list was about 15 different things...when we got to the restaurant, our waiter memorized all 15 items and repeated it to me just to reconfirm... All of the dishes that included duck, or lobster, etc. were replaced by fennel or mushrooms, just for me. This is the kind of effort that is put into each experience. I was so blown away by that consideration. Each dish was mesmerizing, even if I didn't specifically enjoy certain flavors (I forgot to mention I'm not a huge fan of menthol or eucalyptus) the purity of each flavor completely drew me in every single time. What makes this restaurant extraordinary, and each meal in itself spectacular, is the work that goes into it, the respect that Chef Achatz has for each and every flavor he presents to you. Nothing is muddled, every taste is distinct and seriously, probably took years to perfect. I can honestly say that I was not a fan of a couple of pieces I ate that night, but in retrospect it wasn't about ordering something that was a safe staple in my diet, it was about experiencing and trying new things, tasting flavors in their most potent forms and having someone present to you their life's work. I've always had trouble defining what art is, but this was it. It was aesthetically pleasing, there was so much passion, hard work, sacrifice, precision and in the end the product was exactly as it was intended to be. This experience is not for the closed-minded or the faint of heart. You really have to be mentally prepared for 24 courses. At this point, it's no longer just sustenance for your body; it's about taking note of the beauty of each element of flavor and respecting those who spend their entire lives cultivating that. If you really can't take a closer look at what people like Grant Achatz are doing for the culture of food, then we really are just a fast food nation uninterested in anything else except gorging ourselves and going to places like McDonalds."
526,"The meal was a 3.5 hour experience that had more sensory stimulation than basically anything that I had ever done. You walk into a perspective hall and a door slides open to your left. I felt both inadequate due to not having a food camera, but glad that I am adequate enough to eat without taking pictures of my gluttony. I went with the wine pairings and they were great. If you have to choose between the 24 course or the 12 and wine, go with the 24 however. The wines are expertly chosen, but you don't want to miss the food. If you don't have to choose, good for you. Lemongrass - This was a kumumoto oyster will tiny chilis, ginger, and yuzu served with a lemongrass stalk as a serving utensil. Fava Beans - 'Tis the season for favas. This elaborate display started with white pillows filled with lavender vapor. Atop the pillows, the server placed a parfait of fava pure, freeze dried banana, olive oil balls, and a lavender gelato. Shaved pecorino on top. Spring Garlic - Holding onto a ball while eating chicken jelly is not something that I am ready to admit that I have done before, but this was fun. The soup bowl was perfectly spherical and the bite that came with the bowl was lemon with chicken jelly on top. The soup was a puree of spring garlic and was great Ice Fish - Ice fish are these tiny Antarctic fish fried whole and served with fried chips of horseradish, garlic, and potato. It was a fun take on fish and chips. There also were whole asparagus and asparagus emulsion. More ice fish were ground into a tartar like paste. Lobster - This was my favorite savory course. The first setting is a large bowl filled with mint leaves. The second bowl was lobster, ramp puree, spring peas, and foam. As an interruption, we were served lobster crisps with crme. The large bowl was filled with boiling hot water to release the mint vapor and the dish was spectacular. The ramp bulbs were served whole, the greens pureed and mixed with the spring peas and lobster; it was a perfect encapsulation of spring. Not to mention the free facial. Waygu Beef - When course four was served another server came by with what appeared to be table flags. We were told to look, but not touch. When course 6 came by, we got our plate with what appeared to be a tiny simple maki piece. As we glanced at our ""flags"", we noticed that they were slices of beef frozen in liquid nitrogen and were now mostly thawed. The ""maki"" was potato with rendered waygu fat wrapped in a black truffle. The waygu was placed atop what we now realized was a very hot plate and the worked like an amazing meat tarp over the truffle and potato. Aged sherry and more rendered waygu fat topped the course. Short Rib - This course was a perfectly tender short rib boned and place with ramp puree under a gelatinous sheet made from Guinness. Atop the sheet was carmelized broccoli and peanut. Squab - By this time, I was sweating. I needed a cigarette; and I don't even smoke. The squab was decidedly controversial and, as the server noted, was for many diners. The ""loin"" of squab was roasted. Another was placed in chocolate and baked. The dish was flanked by pickled blueberries, hazelnut crme, and spring garlic puree. Chicken skins were ground and used as ""soil"". eaten. Bacon -Bacon on a wire wrapped in butterscotch, smoked by apple wood, and served with a spring of thyme. Carrot - This was a carrot cake. Not any carrot cake that I have ever heard of, but it was great. The spice strip was a Listerine type strip, but instead of making me more appealing on the CTA, this one tasted of nutmeg and cinnamon and made me think of holidays past. The cake was served with a red curry and date puree. There was a marble sized capsule filled with ginger water. The ""soil"" on top was ground pistachio. Chocolate - This is one of the most indescribable food items that I have ever seen and I can only compare it to Jackson Pollack or that drink that you make in a garbage can in college. It was pomelo capsules and juice, smoke capsules, miniflowers, egg yolk in a chocolate capsule, and smoke cream in a brownie brioche shell. Had we not been told to mix it, it would have been a disaster. It has so many offputtingly sexy flavors and textures that it couldn't go together right? Wrong. It was a masterpiece. Sweet Potato - How would you end such an extra extravagant affair, but with flaming cinnamon stick with sweet potato pie tempura on the end lollypop style? It was crunchy and bourbony. You'll notice that I used perfect a lot, but in truth much of the dinner was just that, perfect. The service was wonderful, the wine was great, and the food was out of this world. The creativity involved was inspirational and the valets were prompt. Don't be intimidated by the food. Be intimidated by the price. We were/are and are planning on eating plain rice for a month to pay for our next trip. If you want the unabbreviated version, PM me."
527,"My boyfriend has been bugging me to open a Yelp account for some time now. We love to eat out and try new restaurants, especially when we're traveling, so he thought that I should share our experiences with others since Yelp reviews have helped us narrow down new places to try in the past. But it wasn't until I ate at Alinea that I was inspired to write a review. So I dedicate this first review to him and Alinea, if you can do such a cheesy thing. Before I get into a few details, I would sum up Alinea as the best dining experience I've had so far. It beats Daniel and LeBernadin in NY, Providence and Sona in LA, Robuchon L'atelier and even Bar Charlie in Vegas (Bar Charlie being my favorite fine dining restaurant until Alinea). My first visit to Chicago was last week. We went for my boyfriend's birthday and were able to snatch a last minute reservation at Alinea on Friday night at 5:30 p.m. When we first called, they were all booked for December but the trick is to keep calling each day for any last minute cancellations. Because Alinea charges something like $100 per person if you don't cancel within 48 hours or so of the reservation, people who can't make it tend to cancel early to avoid this expense. So don't give up if you can't get a table the first time. Keep trying. 5:30 p.m. is pretty early for dinner if you ask me, especially since we're from California and that meant eating dinner at 3:30 p.m. But it couldn't have worked out better. The restaurant consists of two floors. Upstairs is divided into two rooms. They have two seatings per night, one starting at around 5:30 and the other around 7:30 p.m. or so and the in between reservations are staggered. Because we were the first in our seating, every dish that came out was a complete surprise to us. The patrons who arrived later would see our dishes being served, and thus, the element of surprise was somewhat spoiled for them. So don't feel bad if you get a 5 or 5:30 p.m. reservation. Because I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone thinking about trying Alinea, I won't go through the 20 or so items that we had. We are not wine drinkers so we did not get the pairing; they do not have any other alcohol other than some beers. They don't give you a menu until the end of the meal, as a keepsake. The menu changes seasonally. Of the 20 items we had, there were 3 misses. I disliked most the rabbit consomme and could not finish it. But most of the dishes were original, creative and tasty, and about five or six dishes were to die for. With the $195 charge per person, nominal fee for bottled water and my cappuccino, tax and a 20% tip, the bill for two was about $530. My boyfriend and I both thought the experience was well worth it and we would definitely go back the next time we are in Chicago (especially because Bar Charlie is now closed :()"
528,"We had dinner at Alinea on Saturday night with another couple. I don't even really know how to describe the meal, but to say that it was absolute perfection on a plate and in a glass. We did the 12 course and wine pairing, with the two ""upgrades"". (You reach a certain point when you find yourself paying $300/person for food/drink/tip that another $20 doesn't seem all that bad.) And what a good decision that was - a 2000 Chateauneuf de Pape was served along with lamb seared three ways served on top of the tiniest little smoking granite grill with an infusion of fresh rosemary. I'd go through the courses, but they wouldn't make sense out of context. Let me just tell you that the meal ended with a cinnamon and caramel tempura batter wrapped around a 10 inch cinnamon stick. I might have traded my first born for a dozen of them to go. The service is unparalleled. Our dinner companions have been to Trotters twice and we ourselves have had a fabulous meal or two, but I've never been so comfortable in an upscale restaurant. I was seated on the equivalent of a comfy couch with beautiful silk pillows at my side. Our team of waiters and sommeliers were serious but not stuffy, knowledgeable but not pretentious and definitely enjoy their work and respect their chef. Grant Achatz is an incredibly gifted chef, notwithstanding he's only 32 years old. As we left the restaurant I asked our hostess, who not only sat us, but walked us to the door and hailed us a cab, to point him out in the kitchen. He was leaning over the counter, working along with the rest of the kitchen staff, you would never have known he was the head chef of Gourmet magazine's ""best restaurant in the country"". I was thoroughly impressed. Do make a point to try this fantastic restaurant."
529,"My wife and I and two friends flew in to Chicago this weekend specifically to eat here. After reading the reviews and hearing about Grant Alchatz's tongue cancer, we figured that we should make sure that we ate there soon. It didn't disappoint. We did the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairings and over the course of 4 hours had a fantastic meal. My favorites included the wagyu beef covered in pine leaves and the ""pumpkin pie"" served skewed on a burnt oak branch, but it was all just a delight. Service was pleasant, informative, always there when needed but in the background the rest of the time."
530,"3 stars?!?!? Am I crazy??? Nope, there's a reason...I'll get to it. Overall, I had an amazing experience. It really is just that--an experience, an event. 4 hours with the most creative food I think I'll ever see in my life. For instance, I don't think I've ever needed to be instructed on how to eat each course of a meal before! But before I get to the food, let me just say that the ambiance was incredible. Even just walking into the front door, the hallway looks as if it narrows and shrinks, just like in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Before you get to the end, this magical door whooshes open and you enter the most beautifully lit room. Soft purples, reds, and blues appear to creep up the walls. It's immediately calming and exciting at the same time. We did the full tour. The sommelier recommended (of course) that we do the wine pairing, but at 3/4 the cost of the full-tour, there was just no way I could swing it. So, we opted for wines by the glass. I felt as though my choice was not so subtly disapproved of, but no further discussion ensued. We started immediately with the Hot Potato/Cold Potato, and that was one of the most incredible things I've ever tasted, not to mention the little contraption it is upon arrival. I won't go through all the dishes, but will hit the highlights. I thought the pear bite with olive oil and pepper was incredible. It was presented in a bowl full of eucalyptus, and inhaling while eating the pear was heavenly. The waygu beef was delicious, but it was just the coolest to have the aroma-dry ice-thing accompany the yumminess in my mouth. The sweet potato on a smoldering cinnamon stick was just unbelievable, as was the bacon on a wire. I almost died with the lobster and popcorn cream and the Iberico ham dish, which allowed the ham to begin almost melting over hazlenut deliciousness. The service was impeccable and I really appreciated that they were not pretentious or judgmental. They joked around and seemed to truly revel in the concoctions they were bringing to the table. So, why 3 stars? Well, with just a few dishes left, I found a hair in my dish. The waiter was very apologetic and, both full and a little grossed out, I declined a replacement dish. Another waiter promptly appeared and asked me if he could ""do anything else."" This was an incredibly awkward moment, as I sure didn't want more food after 20 something courses, but did hope they would offer some sort of gesture to make up for the hair. He asked again what they could do and I realized they were putting me in the position of requesting a discount or some other accommodation. I declined, as I felt awkward and figured they would take care of it in some way, as this didn't feel like the kind of haggling I should do in such a nice establishment. Well, when the check came, there was no reflection of the hair and it was, in essence, ignored. It felt too weird to raise the issue at that point and, frankly, ridiculous that it was on me to take care of it. So, we paid. My friend left angrier than me and stated she would not return because of this. I'm still enamored with the rest of the experience, so I'm sure (if I could afford it), I'd be back. But, it did leave a not so positive impression, overall."
531,"Wow! Second best restaurant I have ever dined at. This was the third attempt at dining at Alinea. Our first two had to be cancelled due to last minute work conflicts. So when the event finally came, we were stoked. Be warned, there is no sign that we could see. We drove past the place twice without finding it. Finally we saw the valet sign and voila, we were in! The entrance is a little spooky. It is a dark corridor that tapers narrower the deeper in you go. We crept our way through the dark to the end and a sliding door a la Star Trek silently opened beside us and an immaculately dressed man greeted us warmly. Very spooky indeed. We were immediately let upstairs to our gigantic table for two in a sparsely decorated room that could be on the cover of Wallpaper magazine. The main decoration were these space age lillies in glass vases with the Japanese rock embellishments. The colors were all soothing browns and mauves to tone down the off white linens. And guess what? The linens were actually MADE OUT OF LINEN! Not cotton, not silk, not satin, but LINEN. What a nice touch.There was nothing but the linens adorning the table. The wine menu was like a work of bloody Russian realist ficiton, with 600 or more protaganists, all of them larger than life itself (most north of $80 per bottle). I was a little too peckish and thirsty to read part one of War and Peace so we just ordered what the Sommelier suggested - a champagne cocktail made by mixing a boutique Champagne with just a smidge of sweet dessert wine. Delicious. The Sommelier pushed the wine pairings option, which he describes as painstakingly matched to each course, and rather than making a Tolstoyan effort at the wine list I decided to submit to our Sommelier's will. The meal: 14 courses, all small, many bite-sized, but in whole just a little too much food (which to me is the perfect amount) Every dish was both a work of Art, and a work of Science - in particular, a work of Chemistry. From the octopus nestled in a pillow of papaya with a spoon for a bed, suspended above a bowl of warmed, coconut-infused soy milk , to the black truffle juice someow stuffed to tightly into a ravioli that it literally explodes into your mouth when you bite it (if you are not careful you spew it all over your date) -- this meal is the yin and yang of dining. Most of the courses are really beyond description, and many of the flavor combinations I have never seen before - think bacon with butterscotch; brie or avocado ice-cream; chocolate and lemongrass; apple and horseradish -- get the picture? The amazing thing is, it all works. Plus every course has a science gimmick -- such as your plate sitting on a pillow that has been filled with lavender scented air so that as you eat the weight of the pillow pushes the air out for you to smell with your food; or a licorice cake that is somehow perfectly skewered on a flexible metal rod that somehow suspends just before your cake-hole, so that you can just stick your face into it and have at it, reminding you of the good old caveman days before knives and forks; or like the magical chocolate ball that sat innocently in its bowl until the waiter poured hot white chocolate milk onto it and the top half (AND ONLY THE TOP HALF) of the ball melted away, revealing a cross-section of outer chocolate crust, a molten white chocolate lava mantle, and a chocolate brownie core. How the hell do they DO these things??? Service was almost on the casual side, as the jocular waiters encouraged us to chow down on the licorice cake, and use our fingers to rip into the bacon and butterscotch, but at that place it works. The Sommelier did not dissapoint - the parings were indeed perfectly matched. But that brings me to why I don't like wine pairings. There are always a bubbly course, two to three white wine courses, two red wine courses and one or two sweet wine courses. Well, call me caveman, but I generally would rather have like eight bubbly courses or maybe eight red courses, or maybe four and four. I don't like sweet wine much, and some white wines I just find boring. So next time I will skip the pairing and instead I'll just get mediaeval on the 600 bottle wine list. Finally, I wish there was some kind of music, even if it was almost imperceptable music. A piano, a string section, something. The restaurant was packed but it was so quiet you could hear the waiters at the other tables, and you could hear everyone else's conversations. So it made us self-conscious of our conversations. If I'm going to drop $600 for two people for dinner, I don't want to feel embarrassed when I get loosened up and start telling my date about my Joan Jett fetish... Other nice touches -- replacing the LINEN napkin with a new one every time you go to the rest room, a different type of bread with each course, custom made dinnerware designed around each course, and at the end they bring you the printed menu for a keepsake. A+"
532,"Inventive, enlightening and definitely the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago. The service was phenomenal -- my dining companion's spoon was shifted at the last minute during one course as the wait staff noticed that he was left-handed. (Impressed, he said the last time he had this level of service was at the Bangkok Oriental.) Our 12-course degustacion was memorable, and we were even treated to a tour of the pristine kitchens afterwards. Chicago is truly world-class to have a restaurant like Alinea. As a transplanted foreigner, I rate it on the same level as Spoon."
533,"I really can't write anything that hasn't been written before. Basically, Alinea lives up to the hype. Simply put, it rocked my world. It is #7 in Pelligrino's 2010 World's 50 Best Restaurants for good reason. The outside is completely unassuming and the corridor to the restaurant is otherworldly. We were seated in a room on the second floor and the first thing that caught my attention was that the man next to us was eating a very intricate dessert off the table. That's right, no plates, just spoon on rubbery tablecloth. Once seated and settled, it dawned on me how quiet it was. There was no ambient music. Even though when we were seated, there were 5 other parties in the room with us (plus a handful of servers), the silence was intimidating. We felt the need to be quiet and hush-hush as well. We got one wine pairing in a glass that we shared, and that was amazing, for lack of a better word. The sommelier had a ginormous afro and his demeanor and appearance beared an uncanny resemblance to Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. He was energetic and his explanations and background to each and every wine was delightful. I highly recommend doing the wine pairing; splitting one between two people was the perfect amount to sip on and enjoy with each dish. We weren't disappointed with the 12 course tasting; every course was a crazy mix of a sensory experience that touched upon sight/presentation, smell, taste, texture, sound (yes! Our last dish was a bubble-yum hibiscus cigarette thing that made a funny low pitched grunt as you sucked the contents into your mouth). This was not just dinner, it was a show. The whole experience seemed to throw out the conventional concept of eating. For example, we were given an earl grey infused pillow, not to sleep on, but for our lemon custard earl grey cookie dessert course to sit on, and as the pillow slowly deflated, it emitted the aroma of earl grey as you ate. How cool is that? At times, we longingly eyeballed the other patrons who were doing the 24 course tour, who were presented with things like a giant log. Umm, I want to eat whatever delicious morsels off a giant log! At the end of the meal, they present you with a menu in a big black envelope. That was a nice keepsake and reminder of the most amazing meal I've had to date. There were 2 downsides to my once-in-a-lifetime experience. First, I got chastised for taking pictures of my dishes. Seriously? Okay I understand it's kind of bothersome if you're using a flash but I turned off my flash and I told the woman that. She said ""but your camera still gives off a light"". Dude. It's a red blinking light that most people's camera gives off if you don't use the flash, like the red recording light when you use a video camera. Hey, we're dropping some big money here, it's not like I'm being a paparazzi and going flash crazy. The table next to us had to leave early because the woman got drunk after her 5th course, couldn't eat anymore, was throwing her head on the table every 3 minutes and nearly stumbled down the stairs. And they were frowning on me for taking pics even without a flash? I'd say her demeanor in the nearly full room was much more distracting than my picture taking when it was nearly empty. Secondly, the staff was attentive, so painstakingly attentive that it was almost borderline uncomfortable. We could see them lingering at their waiting area talking about other patrons (namely, drunk woman), and sometimes it felt like we were children at a library being observed by the librarian. Still, those two things did not detract from the experience that much, and I cannot speak highly enough of Chef Achatz's culinary creations. The Alinea experience brings food and eating to a whole new level."
534,"The receptionist misheard me state my last name when I got there. It was the sincerest apology I have ever received. The mineral water was the saltiest I have ever tasted. The cube of foie gras: the most my tongue had ever been coated in saturated animal fat. Then at the end, our dessert was served by the nerdiest man I have ever met."
535,"Alinea was probably the most memorable culinary experience I've had. Probably not the greatest, but definitely the most exciting. I'm definitely not the type who usually spends this kind of money on a meal, so I had high expectations, but I would say that Alinea delivered. I've never had food where the total experience of eating was as well considered and nuanced. As an architect I wish the fairly bland and corporate architecture of the space (despite the funny perspective of the entry hall and the nicely detailed staircase) reflected more of the playful, alien feel I identified in the food. I felt like I should have been eating in something that looked like a felopian tube. I wouldn't normally critique a restaurant on its architecture as some of the meals I've liked the best were served in buildings or strip malls only a few steps up from cardboard shacks, but Alinea isn't a ""normal"" restaurant. I suppose they wanted to focus the attention on the food though. That said, the experience of the actual food was ambitiously intended to be experienced with all five senses, and ultimately succeeded in delighting most of them. They were also extremely conscientious about dietary restrictions, which actually surprised me in meals that involved so much prep work. Two of the six us at the table don't eat land animals, and got substitutions of Japanese sea fish or lobster in dishes typically of beef etc. Unlike other reviewers, I felt that occasionally the meal did slip into ridiculous and goofy territory, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of it. And I don't know if it's middle class guilt around service, but the attentiveness of the servers was somewhat creepy for me, though I'm sure most of their clients are used to it. By the end of the over four hour meal I wished there was an ""opt-out"" clause in my culinary contract so I could push in my own chair and not have to get a new napkin every time I went to the bathroom (which was a LOT since I drink a lot of water, haha). One of my later bathroom trips I jokingly attempted to fold my napkin so it would look new and the server would see it and think one of his coworkers had already given me a new napkin, but my friends said he came over, saw my napkin, laughed out loud, and put down a new one. The creepy attentiveness of the servers was offset by their friendliness, accessibility, and knowledge of the food. And I think they liked us or could tell we were only barely out of college and couldn't really afford it, because they ended up not charging us for one of the six set menus! That saved us like $200! That's major points in my book, though I suppose that could be common practice. Also, midway through the meal my eating buddy told me that when she ate at Per Se they charged $10 per teeny bottle of sparkling water, and since I had been guzzling it (you get thirsty over four hours of eating food chock full of weird salty foams and dehydrating chemicals!), I was terrified that my own water bill would be like $100+, but I think it was just like $8 or $10 per person. What a relief, ha ha. Overall, a fantastic experience and one I'd repeat; if you're buying, anyway. Ha."
536,"I don't know if there is much need for me to add another 5-star rating to the 100 others, but i just have to get this off my chest. It was an unforgettable experience. We did the 12 course dinner. Before i went, i was thinking to myself...how can one possbly eat 12 dishes? And the 24 course meal? forget it! but each course was a delicate morsel of perfection. to call it just food seems like an insult. the combination of taste, smell, color, texture...it was more like an edible art exhibit that totally opened my eyes to how food can be prepapred. now, this is not the kind of dinner i want to have everyday. perhaps once a year. But certainly at least once in a lifetime. Worth every penny. All of you reading this...don't hesitate. Just go. you'll be glad you did."
537,"so I've been to Alinea...tried the 12 course tasting menu. to call this place a restaurant, to call the experience there ""FOOD"" wouldnt do this place a justice. for good and worse. they dont offer food at Alinea. they offer a once-in-a-lifetime-experience. an experience that will shock your five sense, and will constantly challenge you, as time goes by. one can not simply go there and savor a specific flavor or texture. every dish is a creation, pushing the limits of conventional ingredients to the stratosphere. so, why doesnt it deserve 5 stars? because its not a restaurant (imho). its a circus. and call me old fashion... but when i go to eat, i expect food. yes, Chef Grant Achatz has taken ingredients into a whole new level, perhaps that level is more entertaining to the mind, and less to the taste buds."
538,"Wow, what a beautiful restaurant. I've been wanting to eat here since I read about it two years ago in some magazine. After many talks about possibly going to Chicago for this much awaited event, the opportunity finally arose for us to go and experience the much anticipated Alinea. We called a comfortable two months beforehand to set our reservation and were all set for a 9:30 pm dinner, just one day after we ate at another molecular gastronomy joint, Moto (review coming). We took a cab from out hotel to this fairly non-descript restaurant, almost missing it on the way. As you open the door, all you see is a thin corridor. As we walked forward hesitantly, the automatic metal door on the left opens to reveal the interior of this carefully thought out restaurant. The pristine kitchen is on the right. You are able to peak in and see the chefs working their magic. We were seated upstairs, right next to a group of four that we saw the previous night at Moto. No recognition was exchanged, but crazy that we would see another group eating at these two restaurants back to back as well. There is no menu here, just a wine list. You are at the mercy of the chefs. What they create, you eat. We ordered the full tour menu, no allergies... we were ready to get this started. As the waiters deftly moved around the dining room, preparing their guests for their next entree, our waiter placed a small silver circular plate in front of each of us. We looked at it intently trying to figure out what to do with it. We didn't have long to wonder as the waiter placed a wire instrument with a vanilla bean in the center. These surprises would continue the rest of the night as we took our adventure on the Tour Menu: 1- Steelhead Roe - coconut, cilantro, vanilla fragrance 2- Lemongrass - oyster, sesame, yuzu 3- Tomato - basil, mozzarella, olive oil 4- Cauliflower - five coatings, three gels, apple 5- Yuba - shrimp, miso, togarashi 6- Chicken liver - bacon, caramelized onion, vin santo 7- Watermelon - fresh coriander, tamari, bonito 8- Oxalis pod - sweet, hot, sour, salty 9- Short rib - guinness, peanut, fried broccoli 10- Hot potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter 11- Lamb - potato, sunflower, sweet spice 12- Concord grape - yogurt, mint, long pepper 13- Transparency - of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt 14- Cobia - tobacco, radish, cedarwood 15- Celery - pork belly, shiso, sudachi 16- Alaskan king crab - popcorn, butter, curry 17- Wagyu beef - maitake, smoked date, Blis Elixir 18- Black truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan 19- Duck - foie gras, mole flavors 20- Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme 21- Strawberry - violet, nicoise olive 22- Dry shot - pineapple, rum, cilantro 23- Pumpkin - gruyere, Blis maple syrup, smoke 24- Chocolate - fig, olive, pine 25- Dry caramel - salt Many hits and very few misses. I wouldn't even say miss, more like just not my taste. Everything looked beautiful and the service was spot on. My favorite dish of the night was the Hot Potato-Cold Potato. But the most beautiful dish of the night was the Short rib with guinness. I would love to return if I am ever back in Chicago. I think it blew away my dinner the previous night at Moto. Well deserved as one of the best restaurants in America."
539,"I am not worthy of giving Alinea a review. Our experience was by far exceeded in every absolute sense of the word - and in every absolute sense of the experience: touch, taste, sight, sound, scent. If you're worried about the cost, don't waste your time. Money is mere child's play in this realm. I would gladly pay twice as much for the experience we had."
540,I have just eaten a Lamborghini.
541,"Having read soooo much hype about this place I went in almost looking to be disappointed...it didn't happen. Not even a little. The thing is, you HAVE to go in knowing that you're about to drop a SERIOUS chunk of change (though, even with this understanding, the sticker shock is pretty mean). My friend and I decided to partake in the whole experience offered for our 12 course selection, including the champagne cocktail at the beginning of the meal, the wine pairings with the courses and the unbelievably good coffee at the end. Everything, including tip, for the two of us totaled $630. Yeah, I know. But, kinda like I described in my review of Tru, this is not JUST dining out, it's an experience in and of itself. I am not a foodie, I am not artsy. But I do like to go into things in full disclosure and with an open mind. What I came out with was what was so unexpected: I was completely inspired. In each course, the combination of flavors from ingredients I am already familiar with was astounding. Things that I never would have dreamed of going well together worked so harmoniously, never in a shocking manner, but always surprising. Clearly, the chef's knowledge of all ingredients - how they can be prepared in such a way to best compliment one another, how they taste at different stages of natural maturity, their textures, - is deep and, again, astounding. One of my favorite eating experiences is to consume a dish where I am chasing the flavors: ""ooh, I got just got a bite of sweet that works beautifully with all this savory...where's another bit..."" These are the meals where, before you know it, you're stuffed but still want more. 12 of the 13 courses I had were like this...without the ""stuffed"" part. So, the place: Very modern, intimate, lots of clean lines and thoughtful details (the cloth towels in the bathroom - single-serve, no attendant, thank you; the tasteful covers on the HVAC vents in the ceiling; funky and unusual floral arrangements, comfortable chairs). Aside from the fact that, when we walked in through the sliding metal doors, there was no host stand or anyone to greet us for a few minutes so we weren't sure what we were supposed to do, the staff was amazing. I can only assume that each ""server"" is briefed on only a few of the dishes in the series and, when this dish is to be served at any of the tables, they are the guy to do it throughout the restaurant: we had at least 6 different people explain different things to us as they were brought. It also didn't hurt that (especially for a 'girl's night') there were so many cute guys: well-groomed, artsy-types in very nice suits. And the sommelier...hubba hubba. I have a whole description of each course but, alas, it won't fit here. I found myself wondering what I ever did to get the opportunity to have this experience. Thanks E & D!!!!"
542,Alinea isn't officially one of the best restaurants in the world for no reason. This place is amazing! It's not so much a meal as it is an experience. This was one of my favorite places to dine when I went to school in Chicago. I highly recommend this restaurant. The unique flavors/fusions are incredible!
543,"Impressive place to take a date. 21 course was a little much to consume, but the dishes where amazing!"
544,"Probably the best dining experience I've ever encountered, with the emphasis on 'experience'. Our visit was on 7/2/11 and we received an 18 course menu that was unlike anything I've ever had before. The meal was interactive and left you constantly waiting for the next one to come out, all the time saying ""I can't wait to see what's next!"" The only ""tip"" I would pass on is definitely get The wine pairing ($160) but unless you are a serious wine enthusiast it's probably not worth upgrading to the reserved wine pairing ($250) as we did. I didn't find many of the reserved wines to be that worth it. Also I've read a lot of negative reviews of the wait staff. I couldn't disagree more. We probably had 7-8 different servers/runners wait on us, and all were fun and made the experience even greater. The highlight being waited on by Chef Achatz himself for the final course. Would I go back to Alines? Yes... In a heartbeat.... So, I better get saving so I can afford it again!"
545,"alinea. oh, how i love you. i was awestruck from the moment i walked in. the food, the food. each course was a surprise, an explosion of flavors, a little piece of happiness. i kept the menu. i'm thinking of framing it."
546,"Wow. Just....wow! This place is AMAZING. I'm not really sure there is anything I can say that other yelpers haven't already said, but here goes. My husband, some friends and I went to Alinea about a month ago. First, the building, the decor, the ambiance, are all beautiful. Very modern, but not so much as to take away from the food. Which are the stars of the show. Service was impeccable. Everyone was very nice and amiable, when I really expected stuffy and snooty (because this is the type of place you could get away with it). The wine list was explained in detail, and our table decided to order a couple bottles instead of the wine pairing. Typically, a wine pairing is way too much wine for me and the glasses get stacked up because I am not drinking fast enough. On to the food. My husband and I ate whatever was coming out, while our friends had some dietary restrictions, which where well accomadated. So I can't really speak to everything that was served to them, as one does not eat meat but eats fish, while the other one doesn't eat fish or cheese. But they were both very happy with everything that was served to them. I did not memorize the menu, Alinea gives you a menu to take home with you so you can remember everything you ate. Thankfully :) We all had the tasting menu (which was more than enough foof for us, but when I saw other dishes being served to other tables that were on the full menu I was a little jealous :). 1. English Pea - fantastic way to start the meal. Very fresh tasting even though it was like dippin dots of peas. Yummy. Little encapsulated sherry droplets were very interesting addition. There were a lot of ""encapsulated this"" or ""jelly that"" throughout the meal. 2. Lobster. Delicious! My friend and I were trying to figure out how we could make these at home so we could watch the World Cup games and pop these little morsels of goodness into our mouths. Super gourmet bar food is what it reminded us of. 3. Distillation of Thai Flavors - Least favorite (there has to be one). Just weird. They said is was a plate cleanser for the next dish, but I really don't think it added anything to the meal. 4. Pork Belly - Most favorite!! So so so yummy. I am not going to spoil the surprise for you, but trust that you will be pleasantly surprised. i was raving so much about it I think my only-fish-eating friend considered trying it :) 5. Sturgeon - Very good. I haven't had a lot of sturgeon before this and I'm afraid to get it after this because I don't think it could ever be as good as this one was. Super fresh. 6. King Crab - Served three ways. Some better than others. Texture was weird on one of them (like a pudding almost) which threw it off, but overall very good. 7. Lamb - Awesome! The sauce was to die for and lamb was perfectly cooked. Another one that I could have eaten an entire plate of. 8. Hot potato/Cold potato - I'm really not sre what all the fuss is about on this one. It was just...ok. I didn't get it i guess. All I really tasted was truffles (which are great, don't get me wrong, but this isn't hot truffle/cold truffle). 9. Tournedo - Wagyu beef. Outstanding. Second-tied-for first-favorite dish. It felt like it was melting in my mouth. It's dishes like this that I REALLY don't understand how people are vegetarian. THIS is why people eat red meat. 10. Earl grey - Loved the different textures and the combination of lemon and chocolate. Very lemmony, but I like that sort of thing. If you don't (like my husband) this will not be your favorite. 11. Chocolate - Cocunut, menthol, hyssop. Definite menthol flavor, which was strange and tasty all at the same time. 12. Bubble gum. - So weird. While a very cool way to the end the meal, I wish it hadn't been the last flavor/texture in my mouth. So, is Anthony Bourdain on to something when he talks about the tedious-ness of eating these tasting menus. Maybe. It does take a long time. It could be difficult to sit there and carry on a conversation with someone always coming over to explain what your eating - but our friends and I managed to do it, we had an amazing time. Also, I realize that Achatz is a food pioneer, in the vein of molecular gastronomy, but enough with the encapsulated things and gels! There were too many. Maybe I wasn't doing it right. Good, but there were so many that i started to think that it was just too much, bordering on gimmicky. But I would never say it was bad. Or even close. Overall, you have to go to this place. Yes it is expensive. But I didn't cringe when I got the bill. Because if ever there was a place that is worth the money, this is it. You can see where your money is going. This is not the kind of place you go to once a month, maybe more like once a year. Or at least once in your life. Save up the money and go."
547,Perfect. Exquisite. Extraordinary. Totally worth it. I would go again in a heartbeat (as long as I had the money to pay for the equally extraordinary tab at the end of the night...).
548,"After 130 reviews I believe yelp has gotten the point across that this is the best restaurant in Chicago. Not only in Chicago, but a pinnacle for modern cooking. I do not feel the need to explain the greatness of this establishment because so many already have. I will just say that Alinea is one of the top dining experiences in my life and any diner would appreciate the art and the passion bleeding from this restaurant. I believe eating here is like watching Picasso paint or Mozart play. In years to come Chef Grant Achatz will be as important as Auguste Escoffier was to haute cuisine as Grant is to modern cooking."
549,"Wow. Where do I begin? We arrived early and they were ready for us. I have never eaten at a place where the service was as impeccable. We never wanted for anything. We never felt rushed, yet we didn't feel like it was slow. They truly do let you set your own pace. We had fun with the waiters and never felt as if it were a pretentious atmosphere. Contrary to what most people on yelp suggested, we did try the wine pairings, since it was our first time there. The pairings did not disappoint. Each course was brilliant in its presentation, ability to interact, and the imagination was such that we had never seen before. The flavor profiles of each dish were perfect. I have a hard time choosing my favorite dish. We can see why alinea is at the top of its game and commend the masterminds behind this well oiled machine."
550,"There is a reason this is the best restaurant in America. This was the best restaurant I've every eaten at and one of the best meals I've ever had. Dining here is a an experience you will never forget, Achatz deserves the hype, there is little I can say that will encompass the entire night, but the genius not only behind the food, but in it's conveyance is to be noted. For instance, eating a salad while hot rocks fill the air with the aroma of the basil placed on them gives you the sense of dining in the midst of a garden, or the cut of Kobe beef so succulent that your mouth explodes with the flavor. Each course is not only satisfying in taste but in presentation and consumption. I'm doing Alinea injustice by trying to write about the quality, just know you should go."
551,"A simply amazing meal. As another reviewer noted, the menu is simplified, and while Pookie and I were there it was 12 courses or 23. The wine pairings were quite exotic and international, and varied from very good to spectacular for my taste. The food was consistently spectacular. This is an experience, not just a meal. We started the 23 course tour at 9:30pm and finished at about 2:00am. The bill was about $700. We sat in the downstairs dining area where there were 5 tables. Not sure how big upstairs is. Extremely attentive service, relaxed and elegant atmosphere and above all the food and wine is unreal. Highly recommended if you can swing the $."
552,"When others Yelpers say the courses were 20+, believe therm! I had deep dish pizza at Due for lunch around 2-3p, thought I was gonna be okay for our 9p dinner reservations. Oh boy, was I wrong. 7-9 course I was ready to explode, the whole dinner lasted close to 4 hours. I'll have to come back after starving myself for a day. I'm so sad because I couldn't enjoy the whole meal. Probably the only time I didn't finish the wine pairing! BTW, make reservations ASAP, they start taking them 2 months in advance. The service was impeccable!"
553,"If you have the cash, book your reservation. Do it today. You will remember this meal for the rest of your life. Chicago is extremely blessed to have a talent like Achatz, and who knows how long it'll be before another, flashier city lures him away. Experience Alinea while you can. Savor the memory all the rest of your grubbin' days."
554,"we had the 12 course meal with the wine pairing. All the dishes were so interesting, the presentation stunning! The bite-size portion was perfect and the special dishes were one of a kind. Some things popped in the mouth, spilling out interesting flavors. The wine pairing was good at times and seemed unmatched at other times. But to be truthful, the food wasn't as tasty as I was expecting it to be. Or maybe my expectations were too high."
555,"Alinea is deservedly highly-praised. They do shorter (around 12 - 14 courses / 2 - 3 hours) and longer (around 22 - 28 courses / 4 - 6 hours) tasting menus. For me, it was more about the experience than the food and Alinea definitely lived up to the expectations set by its 5-star Yelp rating. Food: I had the 26-course tour with wine pairings and while it was tasty and artistic, I was in a food coma for a day or two after! I probably should have gone with a shorter tour. As some other reviewers have noted, the focus at Alinea is on the experience first and the taste second, which isn't to say the food is less than great but, with 26 dishes, some are much better than others. Chef Grant Achatz and his excellent kitchen staff play with texture, color, scent, and taste and deconstruct and reinterpret more common dishes. The menu, which changes regularly, often features interesting and surprising combinations (lamb and chocolate, or bacon and candy). They take full advantage of the large number of dishes to make the eater interact with the food in different ways (eat meat off a wire; suck mousse from a tube or liquid from a sphere). The result is a fun culinary voyage. Side note on the wine pairings: wow! Dinner for two, with wine, was around $900. 4 stars. Service: The wait staff is extremely attentive and when engaged became quite friendly, which made for a better experience. I left after 1 AM, after a five hour meal, and think there were two or three waiters devoted to my table for the last few hours. Also, they give you a copy of the menu to help you remember it all! 5 stars. Decor: Relatively open and airy and spread out over two stories. For some reason Alinea reminded me of a nice but cold home. I sat upstairs in a room a bit too quiet and private for my taste. Definitely spend a few minutes in the kitchen, watching masters at work. 4 stars. Summary: Food (60% weight for Overall): 4 stars. Service (20% weight for Overall): 5 stars. Decor (20% weight for Overall): 4 stars. Overall: 4.2 (rounded up to 5 because of the overall Alinea experience) stars. Very good, interesting, and innovative food and an amazing overall experience."
556,"Over the top and amazing. When I saw that this place was ranked higher than French Laundry on the Gourmet Magazine list of top 50 restaurants, I knew that I had to go. We had the ""tour"" menu which was 23 courses and the wine pairing. At 9:30pm on a Thursday night, we started our ""tour"" and we left the restuarant a little before 2am having experienced an explosive array of flavors and combinations. I have to admit, I was tired and sleep deprived from the flight that day so I slept through course 21(even though Paul tried to wake me up) and somehow woke up with chocolate on my face, but it definately wasn't due to the lack of innovative and delicious flavors. Ok, not bad I managed to have 22/23 courses. :)"
557,"Alinea is fabulous. If you are considering going to Alinea, go! You will not regret it. Also...If you go, definitely get the tour (the 24 course tasting menu).....after all, if you are going to Alinea you should go all out."
558,"OMIGOD... coming from a culinary town such as SF, I had high expectations. Every expectation was surpassed! This was the most amazing culinary experience of my life. From the waitstaff to the presentation to, of course, the food there was a rush of anticipation and sometimes wonder; as in ""how do I eat this?"". Great atmosphere, amazing food, unbelievable experience!"
559,This place it a lot like Tru (but not quite as good). Still a very upscale restaurant and very much worth trying. They have very unique ways of serving your dishes here. We went two times and both times we were very impressed. The chef here and at Tru both started out in Evanston at Trio (which is now closed). My first date with my fiance was at Trio 9 years ago and it was an experience that I never had until that day. Definitely would recommend trying Alinea for a unique experience.
560,"This place never seizes to amaze. I've been here several times for different functions. I always leave with a lasting satisfaction and also an appreciation to savoring your food. To all those who come here, book now.. I believe this place is booked for weeks. Also make sure you have all evening depending on which course tour you will take. The tasting tour is 12 courses and the menu tour is 24 courses. I would go for the 24 course tour. You're already spending 135 for the 12 course.. why not go 60 more for 24 courses. I've had both and I would definitely choose the 24 courses just because you are left with a more of a satisfying and full feeling. Each course is going to be something you have never tasted before. The preparation, taste, smell, and the ingredients that compliment the course will leave you savoring each moment. Your tastebuds will be given a delightful gift each time you take in any of the delicious courses presented to you. I can go on and on with the food, but it's more of the experience that really justifies the price."
561,"Could this place receive more than 5 stars? What a fun dining experience! We did the full tour and it was better than I could have imagined (although if you look at their menu, you realize that it's pretty hard to imagine what you're going to get). I also did the wine pairings and they were delicious. I am dying to get a bottle of the Riesling they served with a later course. Despite 24 courses, I never felt overly full. Truly an experience -- and we went into the kitchen afterward, which was a treat!"
562,"You don't just go to Alinea to EAT food, you go there to EXPERIENCE food. It is a common belief that out of the five senses we only use ""taste"" and ""sight"" when we dine, but Alinea shatters that misconception and entices every sense. I would love to go into detail about how they accomplish this and give a description of all 12 courses (which I could do from memory), but I almost feel like I would be ruining the experience for anyone dining there for the first time. One of the aspects that I was most impressed with was the well-orchestrated serving ritual, I felt like I was watching the servers dance a graceful waltz.. It was also refreshing to encounter a friendly staff in a fine-dining environment. You can tell that the staff takes pride in their work and they have a lot of respect for the Chef. I wish I could give this restaurant 10 stars. If you had to choose one place in the world to eat at in your lifetime, this is that place!"
563,"You know a restaurant is good when you can remember 90% of what you ate weeks, months, and even years afterward. This is the case with Alinea. Just go, you will not be disappointed. And order the homemade sodas."
564,"Must try before you die! Seriously, everything was so thought out. Its the most interesting food I've EVER had."
565,"the food was nice and interesting to look at but other than that what the heck? Very expensive and I have been to 20 - 30 restaurants where the food was better. I like good food, very good food and this was neither."
566,"I registered Yelp for a long time but always too lazy to write reviews. I really want to give my first one to Alinea although I went there awhile back. It's the best meal I've ever had. Taste, atmosphere, decoration, service are excellent. Creativity is amazing. Every course is like an art piece. Me and my fiancee were debating to do 12 or 27 courses when we booked and finally we chose 27 courses tour menu. It's a long tour, enough time to fly coast to coast, but it's an incredible experience. We're exciting to wait for the next course. They use different tools and effects to enhance the dinning experience. I highly recommend the 27 courses meal. I felt bad for the people sat next to us who only had 12 courses and didn't know what my other 15 courses taste like. Yes, it's pricey but it's worth every pennies."
567,"We dined at Alinea back in August. I think it's nearly impossible for someone to love every single dish in a multi-course dinner. Alinea is no exception, but I must say the overall dinning experience was phenomenal. Alinea really stood out with exceptional service, tremendous attention to details, great atmosphere, harmonious flavor and artistic presentation of each course. Every foodie should visit Alinea at least once."
568,"since moving to chicago (and even before that), i've been dying to go to alinea. it was all i wanted for my birthday so this year we went. my experience was good but not as great as i expected from the food to the service to the atmosphere. to start, we got a lot of pressure from one of the sommeliers about doing the wine pairing. we tried to decide if it would be worth 3/4 of our food bill and just couldn't rationalize it. after saying that we just wanted to do glasses/bottles instead of the entire pairing, the sommelier once again tried to tell us how worthwhile it was. i'm sure it is if i had thousands of dollars to spend all the time. otherwise, the service was pretty nice. i tend to ask a lot of questions about the food i'm eating but at alinea they like you to just experience the flavors without knowing exactly what you're eating. so they were nice about it but told me basically to stop asking. as for the food, while many of the courses were amazing, there were some misses. i guess i've just never been to this nice of a restaurant and disliked some of the food so much that i couldn't finish it. with 24 courses it's bound to happen but i was still surprised. my favs were the pork belly with iceberg lettuce, cucumber and thai distillation. this was exactly what i thought i would experience at alinea. really interesting, different than anything i'd had before and absolutely delicious. the other things i loved were the black truffle explosion and hot potato/cold potato. again, both were amazing, delicious and crazy. as for dessert, we got the silicone mat dessert and grant achatz himself artistically placed every item on the mat for us. i was totally startstruck and the dessert itself was awesome. the main dish that i didn't like was one that was several different versions of olives. i couldn't finish it. nothing about it tasted good to me. except for the silicone mat dessert, nothing else was a true dessert. we had several dishes that were savory and sweet. i'm all about savory/sweet combinations but some were just way too strange. i like to think i'm an adventurous eat but i felt like somethings such as the smoky peanut butter dessert (which really tasted partially like cigarette butts to me) were just not good. one other gripe. before leaving they gave me a copy of our menu and we asked grant achatz to sign it, which he did. i'm an idiot and left it in the cab on the way home. my fiance has been emailing them and calling them for almost a month now and they have not responded. after spending almost a grand at dinner, you'd think they could at least call us back. this put me over the edge to the three stars. it's truly a once in a lifetime experience. i don't think i'd want to do it again unless of course i wasn't paying for it. the food is worth trying but i'm still not sure that the price is justified."
569,"Okay, so if you're like me, a petite Asian female and on a weight-loss plan for the past year where you now eat 4-6 small meals per day, even having the 12-course tasting with the wine pairing is an absolute challenge. In our case, it was more like 15 courses. By the time we had our last savory course (the bacon hanging on a wire), I was ready to fall asleep/keel over. I would go to Alinea again, but probably opt for no more than two glasses of wine (one red and one white) and stick with the 12-course tasting menu. I've read on other blogs that the 24-course meal has smaller portions, but that didn't appear to be the case when I was there. There were two tables (one party of two and a larger party of six) that were going the ""tour"" and I just marveled at how they could even handle it. I was more impressed with the savory courses than the sweet/dessert courses. The presentation of all the courses was beautiful and surprising (although not too surprising since I read a lot about what to expect from various foodie blogs) and the service was excellent. I honestly could have ended the meal with the palate cleanser (guava). Of the savory courses, the one that left me confused was the lamb course. I think that it should have been named ""English pea"" since this was the predominant ingredient/flavor for me. But do take my comments with a grain of salt, so to speak...I was quite ""toasty"" by the 12th course. Maybe if I weren't so drunk, I'd have a different opinion of the sweet courses. This was definitely the most expensive meal we've ever had ($500+ for two--that's the tasting menu plus wine pairings, tip and tax). We were there for at least 3.5 hours."
570,"The food was excellent! The presentation was even better! However, I left still very hungry and the service was terrible. Our waiter was high or something! When he was describing our plate we started telling us what was in it and then said ""and some other stuff"". With almost every course! If I'm paying a nice chunk of my weekly paycheck to eat here, I want to know what that other stuff was!"
571,"This is really a four and half star review, Alinea lost half a star for its stuffy atmosphere but in a fine dining restaurant you always expect it to be stuffy to some degree. I ate here in January and like most people it was a special treat after hearing so much about this restaurant for years. My favourite dish was the plate that was a study in butter which had lobster,popcorn and curry all mixed together. A combination that shouldn't work but tasted amazing. The wagyu beef was also cooked to perfection (you will crave more however part of the allure of Alinea is that you will receive modest portions so that you do crave more). Keep in mind that two people will easily spend $500 in Alinea so my expectations will always be higher when that kind of cash is being thrown around. On a funny note one of our servers (you will have many at Alinea who are all highly trained and attentive)rebuked my girlfriend for getting her plate with a linen cover on it dirty as she put her butter knife on top of it. Funny but a bit strange to be ticked off for ultimately getting a side plate dirty. Overall a great evening but once you get the Alinea experience out of your system you won't rush back there."
572,#1 dinning experience.
573,"4.5 stars. A meal at Alinea is an experience. It's not just the food, which is fantastic, but the presentation that makes it so great. Very few of the 26 courses we had even came on plates, but rather logs, pillows, test tubes, wires, and more. Out of 26 courses (+some), only a few were not to my liking. The squab was not my favorite, but my husband really enjoyed it. So many dishes were fun, creative, and painstakingly created. The effort shows and is worth it. I don't know that I would have the same experience if I went back, because part of it is the uniqueness of the situation. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to savor and enjoy their food, including creativity and depth of flavor."
574,"I'm not going to talk about everything that's wonderful here, it would take too long. Instead, I'm going to make some minor complaints. Given the price, the staff to diner ration, etc. etc. these things could be improved. First, salt. There were two dishes (surf clam and and lamb) that had components that were burn-the-tongue salty. Seriously - burger king chicken sandwich levels of salt. In the case of the clam, when all the elements were mixed in one bite, it worked out okay. A number of other dishes were also at the too-high end of the salt spectrum, though not to that drastic of an extent. Which brings me to flavor. The problem with having too much salt is that it interferes with tasting anything besides the salt. In general, I think the focus here is on avant garde technique and beautiful presentation and flavor is neglected. There were a number of dishes - even those without salt problems - that tasted good, but not exceptionally good or interesting or unexpected. The earl grey cookies didn't really taste of anything at all, although that course worked as a whole. Wine pairing was hit and miss - for the first half of the tour, things didn't match so well for me, and some of the wines didn't work for me at all, but the second half was spot on (although it's possible that nothing pairs well with menthol) Finally, I wish that there was a restaurant in this class that was as creative with the front of house as it is with the food. There are so many other possible ways to experience a meal - it shouldn't always have to be a dim, hushed, dining room with erudite and slightly stuffy waiters. We had a great time, but high prices and hype breed high expectations and I expected more!"
575,"My husband and I recently went to Alinea to celebrate a special occasion. I am a bit of a picky eater, so I was a little nervous about the tasting menu. There was really no problem though because they will easily accommodate dietary restrictions. My husband and I don't eat pork, so we mentioned it ahead of time and they were sure to make a couple of adjustments for us. I also noticed that a woman nearby was a vegetarian, and for each course that included meat they would bring her something different. The service at Alinea was amazing. There seem to be more waiters than diners. One thing that I really appreciated was their occasional instructions on how to eat a course. Some courses are brought out in special serving dishes created just for Alinea. The food is presented in such an artistic way and some of the actual serving dishes are equally artistic. It's nice to have reassurance about how exactly you should eat a couple of the courses. The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. I don't really want to ruin this surprise, but it's a gorgeous display of sweets on the table that is also super delicious! While I enjoyed most of the dinner courses (I just don't like some flavors - nothing was prepared poorly), I completely loved every bite of dessert! One last thing, prepare to be there for a while. It's a long meal with all those courses. You don't want to be sleepy during the grand finale!"
576,"Alinea is an interesting restaurant experience. The creativity and innovation are probably unmatched in the U.S, so it's worth checking out. But I can't say that it was the greatest meal that I've ever had. You have to have a good idea of what you're signing up for. First, the portion sizes are quite small, so you wonder if you'll be full by the end of the meal. I will temper this first critique a bit, since it is a twenty course meal and they don't want people to feel uncomfortable. Next, I thought that a lot of the dishes were quite complex and had too many ingredients battling for center stage, which dilutes the impact of those certain flavors that may not need to share the spotlight. Additionally, the ""hands on"" experience of some of the dishes may generate ""oohs"" and ""aahhs"" from some diners, but can just as easily be viewed as smug and contrived by others. Lastly, I found the service to be just average; many of our servers were twenty-something males that exuded a vibe that was a bit frat-boy/haughty/irreverent as opposed to my expectation of a more gracious/respectful experience. What really got to me was that after we left an 18% tip on the pre-tax bill - which I thought was more than sufficient given the $195 prix fixe - one of the servers voiced his displeasure about the gratuity to his colleague, who gave him a compassionate ""That sucks"", all while we were still within earshot. Not cool. In sum, Chef Achatz's mastery of the food arts is worth experiencing, and Alinea's reputation as a culinary Mecca for food enthusiasts is well-deserved. But if you're looking for a simple, well-executed, hunger-satisfying meal, then you may want to consider other options."
577,"so good, SO good, SO GOOD!! I went to Alinea and of course, did the tour. I just feel like if you are going to come here and spend the $$$, you might as well go all out. However, instead of doing the wine pairing, my boyfriend and I each got 4 half glasses (2 whites and 2 reds each) and shared them. I was honestly full by course 8 (luckily I willed myself to ignore my hater stomach), so I am glad that we did not do the wine pairing. Courses I loved: Roe (1) - osetra with a clear gel that tasted like lemon, capers, and dill; brioche foam; creme fraiche; egg yolk emulsion Pork Belly (2) - A shot of lemongrass, fish sauce, and chili peppers - distilled so not spicy - the ""thai distillation"" part. Then a plate with iceberg lettuce compressed with cucumber; pork belly confit and banana in a coconut curry sauce; avocado puree and basil seeds; dot on the plate of ""chili sauce"" - cayenne / bell pepper pudding. Like an amazing lettuce wrap! Lilac (4) - Basically the creamiest, most delicious seafood chowder with perfectly cooked scallops and clams, lilac-scented discs, celery, fennel, and honeydew foam and melon balls. Perfection!! Sweet Potato (9) - Tempura fried sweet potato - creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. You suck the sweet potato puff off of an aromatic cinnamon stick burning at the other end. (my BF's fave) Hot Potato (11) - The flavor of potato, parmesan, and truffle was delicious. I wish the dish was larger as it was definitely one of my absolute favorites. Wagyu Beef (15) - Tender and marbled with fat. Loved the ""salt and vinegar chip"" Bubble Gum (18) - Tube filled with hibiscus jelly, creme fraiche, and orange gel (bubble gum tapioca pearls). You suck everything out of the tube all at once. It was so pretty I didnt want to ruin it. But VERY delicious! Chocolate (21) - The taste of this dessert was pretty good, but when Grant Achatz himself makes it for you on your table, it becomes a favorite. Cool, cool experience and presentation. If I could, I would give this place 4.5 stars because my boyfriend would start blowing smoke out of his ears if I only clicked 4 stars for this place. It was amazing and unlike any restaurant I have ever been to...but it's not Schwa. I love the rawness of Schwa, and this place made me feel anxious because of the laser-like precision with which the food is served. Dont get me wrong, the service is top-notch and does everything perfectly, but I prefer a more laid-back vibe when I am supposed to be enjoying myself. The food is fun and playful, so I think the servers should be as well. Overall, amazing!! I would go back tomorrow if I didnt have to pay rent every month."
578,"Nearly a month has elapsed since we had dinner at Alinea - a much anticipated and expensive treat. Having read Grant Achatz's cookbook and biography we were anticipating some stellar taste treats with comparable service and ambience - to the extent that this would be possible - to Tallevant or Divellec . Having eaten at Jean Chauvel's Paris outpost of molecular gastronomy ""Les Magnolias"" in Perreux sur Marne several times, I was expecting the food to be both as interesting and surprising and several steps up from Chauvel. In retrospect, Alinea was great theatre -other reviewers have compared it to Vegas - and on that basis it was really great. The food however, despite its visual appeal - perfectly photogenic - and legendary intricacy in preparation was, I'm afraid to say, unexceptional and overall bland. My wife was concerned about an allergy to octopus - there was however so little of it - maybe 5g - it would easily have passed unnoticed. The chocolate mousse was a desecration of chocolate - more Sara Lee than haute cuisine. I'll stick with the Achatz family's pies. The wine accompaniment was both overrated and overpriced - as had been noted by the Weekend WSJ several months back. The sommelier, indistinguishable - except for the hands - from Johnny Depp in ""Edward Scissorhands"", was a precocius and pretentious bore. Choosing from the quite reasonable priced wine list would have been a better alternative and would have avoided the convoluted and uninteresting drivel about the sourcing of each wine - which meant very little to the captive diner - about as interesting as a Wall Street type blathering on about CDOs. The coffee was however superb although charging $8 for Badoit water when the meal was $215 and the wine accompaniment $160 was more than a little greedy. There are much better restaurants in Chicago - like ""Les Nomades"" where the food matters more and where you can dine for half the price. And, based on our visit to Alinea, I think we will have to substitute Guy Savoy for a planned visit to Heston Blumenthal's ""Fat Duck"" . Alinea was an experience indeed but not one worth the money to repeat."
579,We had a great time. The service was amazing. The food was even better. I cannot stop thinking about the truffle explosion. The dessert they made on our table was also unbelievable!!! The wine also was un real.
580,Unbelievable! My best friend had gift certificates for here because she is the ultimate foodie and I was lucky enough to be her date for the evening. I was blown away with the entire meal. The wine pairings were perfect and the service was excellent. It was for sure the most interesting and exquisite dinner that I've ever experienced. If money isn't an issue and you want an experience while dining then this is the place to go.
581,"I saved the best for last as I am writing up all my reviews after returning from my Chicago trip tonight. Alinea was THE restaurant I've longed to go for some time now. Finally I made it out this past weekend with my friend who was willing to fly all the way to Chicago just to eat at all these wonderful places with me even if she's pregnant! Last year she took me to Manresa (currently one of my favorite restaurants) for my birthday and this year it's Alinea. Yes, I have the best friend in the world that spoils me wayyyyy toooo much! I don't know how I'm going to outbeat this night when it's comes time for her birthday next year. We got there early and they happily seated us to our tables upstairs. I was all smiles because I was so excited. This was the most unique experience I've ever had - one of molecular gastronomy. eehhh?? what is that? It means ""scientific discipline involving the study of physical and chemical processes that occur in cooking"" Every dish was creative and complex. We were impressed with the imagination and the detail that were delivered in each of the 14 courses. Yep, 14 courses. Thank god we didn't do the 22 courses because I felt like my stomach was going to burst at the end of our experience. One must be open to eating anything and everything, and appreciate the flavors to truly enjoy this restaurant. 1. Trout Roe with coconut, hyssop, passinofruit - sweet, spicy, salty 2. Tomato with basil, mozzarella, olive oil - tomatoes came in different forms (hydrogenated, jelly, etc) with a icy foamy mozzarella with cubed balsamic vingear jelly. 3. Cauliflower with five coatings, three gels, apple - this is a seasonal dish. There were 5 custard like cauliflower cubes. Each coated differently (parmasean, almonds, bacon, don't remember the rest). But you really have to use your palate to distinguish each one. 4. Lobster with popcorn, butter, curry - yummy but a little too rich especially if you pop that butter balloon which my friend did =) 5. Wagyu beef from Japan with maitake mushrooms, smoked date and Blis Elixir - this was my favorite. It was so flavorful that it kept me wanting more. 6. ShortRib with Guiness, peanut and friend broccoli - this was a big dish and we were only half way through our menu. 7. Hot potato with cold potato, black truffle and butter chives - it was a generous portion of truffle. This was my friend's favorite dish. 8. Lamb with potato, sunflower, sweet spice - whew, last of the savory dishes 9. Concord grape with yogurt, mint and long pepper - the big ball was in a shot glass which we had to open wide. The big ball cracks in your mouth and oozes out. My friend almost choked on this one. 10. Watermelon with fresh coriander, tamari and bonito 11. Bacon with butterscotch, apple and thyme 12. Pumpkin with gruyere, Blis maple syrup - this was cool. We ate this over a pillow of smoke so it's like your eating a smokey dish. 13. Chocolate with fig, olive and pine - oh boy, we can't eat anymore but we manage to eat it because it's so good. *** Birthday chocolate ball **** 14. Dry caramel with salt - dried flakes of caramel that becomes chewy in your mouth. Finally, we made it through our meal. I didn't even mention the breads which accompanied some of the courses, such as the napa cabbage fennel bread or the oolong tea black sesame seed bagel. We should get a prize for getting through the finish line though we were quite impressed with the couple behind us finishing up a 22 course menu. Alinea also serves a very nice range of teas - one which was a imported 1947 tea that cost $95 for a cup of tea! holy cow! At the moment, Alinea, Manresa and Joel Robuchon (Tokyo - Ebisu Garden location) are tied on my restaurant list. I think if Alinea served less rich dishes it would be the top of my list. We're already talking about our next trip in the near future to El Bulli (Spain) and Fat Duck (UK - I couldn't get a reservation when I was there this past August so next time I have to call exactly 3 months in advance) which both serve molecular gastronomy cuisine. Hopefully we can do New Orleans before that since my sister and her are craving crawfish - hhmm... could just be a pregnancy craving for both of them so we'll see!"
582,Wow... probably the finest molecular gastro restaurant in the US. The dishes are not something you can do yourself at home and not something that most will conceptualize. But ultimately the taste works and its a glimpse into what modern cuisine is like.
583,"I feel as unqualified to write a review on Alinea as I did dining there. I am no chef, critic, or connoisseur and can only make the ranks of being a ""foodie"" in the most amateur sense of the word. My roadtrip to Chicago was just me tagging along with a friend and this privilege extended to a Dining Experience at this Formal Jacket Required establishment. And, yes, oh yes, was it an experience. From the get go, Alinea stands out in my memory because of its exceptionally unexceptional outward appearance. A slate colored, nearly-residential front with no name and dimly lit windows you cannot peer through. Going through the front door places you in a red-glowing, seemingly dead-end hallway. A timid venture inside surprises you with an automatic stainless steel door that zips aside for you to enter this new world. Everything here - the decor, place setting, service, taste, presentation - is immaculately precise and a fabrication worthy of reverie. FOOD // It's just beautiful. The menu is set, though I do believe there are 2 different options varying in number of courses. Passage of time and culinary ineptitude prevent me from reviewing the food itself. On a tastebud level, it was an enjoyable meal. There were a couple courses I did not care for and left unfinished, despite each course only being one or two bites (or slurp in the case of the tapioca pudding tube). The array of tastes and textures is vast and it doesn't stop there; courses intermingle with scent from a mysterious misty vase or an air pillow that releases aroma as the weight of your plate slowly deflates it. What entranced me the most was the architecture of each course. It is never simply food on a plate. Perfect cube of steak with micropackets of seasoning, strip of mapled bacon hanging from a wire, fragments suspended on pinheads, a landscape of roe. The dessert was an action painting of cream, gele, freeze-dried ganache, nuts, and syrup akin to Pollock with the duo team of chef-artists explaining along the way. Just amazing. I think Alinea should've made that the showstopping finale, but there were two additional, less exemplary sweet dishes. More bang for your buck? SERVICE // The level of service is equal to the size of the hole in your wallet dining here leaves. Table and chair pulled out for you every time, appropriate utensils switched and placed in specific orientation for every course, waiters that not only notice your actions but read your emotions. There was one snootier waiter who seemed disappointed in me (not the restaurant) when I did not finish a course. Another reviewer stated that the waiters will mirror your own attitude, but I was intimidated and overwhelmed more than anything else. I don't front, baby! Everyone else was great though. Special mention for the sommelier. I only drink to get drunk and my date does not imbibe at all, but I'm so glad our hosts did opt for the wine pairing. There were about 6 or 7 wines and each one came with an anecdote of origin and character the whole table could share. I wish every one of my meals could be served with a story. And the sommelier was a red-head with a certified afro. Love it. An experience I will remember forever, I recommend it for anyone in town who can afford it. Celebrate there after you make it on Wall Street or get your sugardaddies/mamas lined up. You're gonna need 'em."
584,i hesitated on doing a review of alinea since its so well known and so expensive but i think my objective in doing it is to say it was worth it. growing up in the business i have always always always always always believed foodservice is about experience NOT just the food. you can apply that to a place like mcdonalds or a place like charlie trotters. alinea just takes it to a whole new level. its perfect for foodies obviously. service was great and i say this because i look so young and i went several years ago with a gf at the time yet they took us seriously. they didn't have gloves and aprons waiting for us thinking we wouldn't be able to pay. they treated us very very well. food was actually great if you were wondering and i hope anyone whose never heard of molecular gastronmy or has a love of it will go. it got voted best restaurant in the world one year. also if you've never head of grant achatz story about his tongue - google it. there will be several LONG articles about his journey with cancer. i think esquire had a really long story. i think its going to be a movie soon. think about it: what is the worst possible sensory capability he could have lost being a chef??
585,"I could get used to this lifestyle. My husband surprised me with dinner at Alinea for my birthday, and it epitomized a luxurious dining experience in every way. Alinea knows what its doing, from top to tippy toes. Instead of deconstructing every aspect of my superb meal, I present the highlights: - attention to detail, from a new linen napkin every time you get up to visit the restroom, to the valet who found us free parking across the street - a vegetarian meal that substituted ingredients to create food that never compromised on flavor, AND produced results identical to what everyone else was eating - personalized souvenier menus - courses that focused on all the senses - especially sight, taste, and smell (the sweet smell of cedar, the nutmeg air - infused pillow) Every part of our food was surprising and beautiful, but I do think Alinea does better on savory courses than sweet. Only because these are the memories that linger. Special standouts were the one bite courses. I could never imagine that such a burst of complementary flavors could come through in a single mouthful. Whatever you need to do to have a meal here - clean out your bank account, take out a second mortgage - do it."
586,"Impecable service, great presentation. Do not look at this as just dinner, this is an experience everyone should have at least once in their lifetime. It's very expensive but that's a given. Wine pairing choices were mostly good except for a couple I didn't care for that much, nonetheless this place deserves its 5 stars. It's worth all the hype. There's no bar so if you are waiting for someone go next door to Boca, they have a nice selection."
587,"soooooo...overall this was a very different and fun experience. all in all, my husband and i decided that it ranks third on our fanciest of fancy dinner list. first is eleven madison park in NYC, second is the french laundry in Yountville, and then Alinea. all the really little bites were great...the big ones, were just ok. the wine parings were just too safe. i mean they were great...just a little on the safe side. caramel powder was really cool, as was the truffle explosion and the hot/cold potato. they sat us in the kiddie room! i believe i am the same age as the chef and even older than the wait staff. while my husband and i feel blessed to be youthful looking, we are tired of being treated like we don't know our fancy dinner shit just because we look young. when we walked in the door the two ladies took my coat, whispered to each other and then put us in the kiddie room. booo door ladies! i would have given them 4 stars, but this action is a no no in customer service. and it's a shame, because it took me a while to get over this and this paragraph is longer than the one that described the food! if you have the money, go for it, but if you don't have gray hair and are naturally young looking because you inherited great genes, be prepared to feel insulted by the door ladies."
588,"Fine dining at it's best. The food quality and presentation is exquisite and the wait service is second to none. This is probably the best restaurant in Chicago but the prices reflect it. Get the 12 course tasting menu and if you can, have someone else pick up the check :)"
589,"Delectable and divine... a wonderful experience and up there with the world's best (Michelin 3*) restaurants! if you're amenable to paying for such a great culinary experience, then you will not be disappointed. Such indulgence doesn't come cheap but it's worth it to me!!!"
590,"FOOD ORGASM!! The only thing I have to say, you just have to go to experience it!"
591,"My husband and I had the pleasure -- no HONOR -- of dining at Alinea. I hesitate to write too much in detail because every single aspect of the experience is so carefully thought through, and full of wonder and delight, that to reveal so much as the shape of the entrance would diminish the unmitigated joy in discovering each moment for yourself. Suffice it to say that we (as unrepentant foodies) have dined at the finest restaurants in the United States (we're from the Bay area and New York -- so we really mean that), and as I said to my husband midway through the meal, Alinea kicks the French Laundry's arse (among other establishments). I have never been a huge fan of molecular gastronomy, since I have found that taste often seems sacrificed in favor of novelty or presentation (such as I found to be often the case at WD-50, which I know many people love). But Alinea compromises nothing. The presentation is dazzling, right down to the flatware. The taste is outer-worldy. The combinations are unimaginable and yet exhilarating. The service was impeccable. It is, in short, extraordinary. My only regret is that I'm fairly certain that Grant Achatz himself came out to do our final presentation, and I was so tongue-tied and startled, and he seemed so focused and serious, that to say anything directly felt like tapping Yo Yo Ma on the shoulder mid-concerto and saying ""Are you Yo-Yo Ma?"" so I just made some dumb remark and then stared at the table. Alas. Such does a mortal tremble in the presence of a (food) god."
592,"You've read the critics' reviews as well as Yelpers' comments. To sum it up in one sentence, this place is just as much about the sizzle as the steak. The food is very savory and delicious, and the presentation is beautiful and elegant. My boyfriend always says that dessert should never come in big portions so that you're left wanting more. Alinea gives you just that: small bites of rich flavor. There were definitely some dishes that I didn't enjoy as much as others. But this is really a personal preference issue and in the end I was still intrigued by what I was eating. The one thing that made my experience less than perfect is that for the dessert portion, the chef did not come out to prepare it for us like he did at all the other tables around us. I was really looking forward to meeting him, so I was very bummed out about this (and felt left out). But I understand that he needs a break and cannot do it for every single table. I just wish he hadn't skipped our table!"
593,"An experience unlike any other, unfortunately with the price to match. Unique dishes, flavors, presentations, aromas, wine pairings, and everything combine to be probably the most memorable meal you will have. Too much goodness to even give it justice by trying to describe here."
594,"While it may be the topped ranked US restaurant in the San Pelligrino World's Top 50 List, Alinea (ranked world's sixth) is not the best food that I've ever had. In fact, I've had several meals where the food was better and at considerably lower price points. However, before you burn me at the stake for heresy, it was definitely the most unique dining experience I've had to date. In short, eating at Alinea is surreal. To simply say everything was visually stunning is an understatement and belittles what one experiences from dining there. A restaurant where presentation extends beyond just presentation and flavor into how the diner interacts with the creations is a vital component of what Alinea is. Interactions range from the relatively obvious to the surprising. For example, at one point a device was arranged on the table and we were instructed to guess its purpose. In other cases, we were provided instructions on how to consume the food. For one dish we assembled the ""conveyance"" for the food out of what appeared to be nothing more than a decorative trivet. This is food you contemplate; sustenance for the intellect as well as the senses."
595,"If you're a foodie and have the spare cash -- and especially if you already live here in Chicago -- then it would be an enormous mistake to never visit Alinea. It is absolutely everything that the critics say: Innovative, creative, thoughtfully prepared food with some of the best service you will see and a calm sparse, New York-chic setting. The way the food is presented beats some of the art I've seen in galleries around here. It's often a shame that it must be eaten. That was only literally the case on one course that I had there the other night: the beef course was incredibly salty and lifeless and the Guinness glace/gel only added to the saltiness. For one of the main course tastes, it was very disappointing. The others were fine, but compared to -- as an example -- Charlie Trotter's, I found myself wanting more flavor and less artifice in a few of the courses. The bacon on the trapeze, though? Genius. I realize the menu changes (and this was on as of March 2007), but I hope it's a permanent fixture. I thought the wine pairing was well worth it and the sommeliers were obviously very knowledgeable, and I appreciated that while they (and the other service) was solicitous, it was not stuffy. In fact, I've never heard so many random pop culture references made at a table at a formal restaurant. The servers and sommeliers in fact, appeared to be hipsters (who happen to know a lot about food and wine). I'm not sure I'd return any time too soon (for one thing, I'm now broke!), but as I said from the start, it is ranked as one of the top restaurants in the entire country, and if you're interested in innovative cuisine, you really should try it at least once."
596,"best.dining.experience.ever. the service was excellent save for a few missteps and one server who was quite stonefaced. also, all of us got the tour except for my wife who got the veggie tour and it was excellent too! we couldn't have asked for a better evening! perfection! here's the course by course break down: osetra, traditional garnishes - very much like thomas keller's oysters and pearls but a modern twist (and no oysters). very light w/ perfect caviar. pork belly, iceberg, cucumber, thai distillation - their play on thai food and it was unreal. pork belly was excellent but what stole the show was the shot of a liquified thai chilies which smelled like it was spicy but had the pure flavor of the chilies w/out the heat. oxalis, juniper, gin, sugar - a gelee dish. it had a bitter flavor which worked well with the flavors of the berries, gin and sugar. lilac, scallop, shellfish, honeydew - this was quite a dish! the base was a lilac ""pillow"" that had essence of lilac. the seafood was incredible and so perfectly cooked. the honeydew foam added a nice sweet accent. pigeonneau, a la saint-clair - chef achatz showed us that he's not all about new styles of cooking. this was a classically prepared dish and was fabulous. the squab, foie gras, and the onions were exquisite and we couldn't have asked for a more perfect crust. black truffle explosion, romaine, parmesan - one of his signatures and it didn't disappoint. it's just one bite but as soon as it enters the mouth, the insides of the ravioli come out and all you're left w/ is black truffles in all of its glory. tomato, fig, nicoise olive, pine nuts - basil leaves and tomato stems that provide the aromatic blanket for this course. a whole salad re-thought! there are olives, black garlic, charred figs and olive oil snow! a great combo of flavors and a dehydrated pumpernickel crouton added some nice texture. the heirloom tomatoes were so good! mustard, passionfruit, allspice bacon, butterscotch, apple, thyme sweet potato, bourbon, brown sugar, cinnamon - the mustard ice cream w/ allspice and passionfruit were presented as a disc and we were asked to let it melt in our mouth. it went from spicy to light to sweet. a very cool effect! the bacon first and it wa perfection. sweet, salty w/ a herb twist w/ the thyme. the sweet potato was basically pie on a stick and perfect way to end the trio. sweet, creamy and w/ a nice bite. hot potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter - another signature of his. we had to pick up the bowl and pull the pin on the side so that the hot contents of the pin would drop in the cold soup and eat right away. the contrast of the temperatures and textures added to an already incredible flavorful dish! yuba, shrimp, miso, togarashi - the yuba (skin of tofu) was hardened and fried to give it a crispy texture. the shrimp was delicious and had the miso dip was outstanding! foie gras, peach, fennel, shiso - the foie gras and fennel which needed to be eaten right away and then the peach juice in the cup needed to be drunk right away. the savory and sweet is the mix here and it tasted nice! uni, aloe, yuzu, chili - this dish made its debut on the menu that night and we were asked by a lot of the wait staff on how we liked it. while uni isn't my thing, this was void of any weird fishy flavor or a weird texture. the flavor worked well w/ the yuzu and aloe but it was inconsistent from bite to bite. wagyu beef, powdered a-1, potato chips - wow! i've never had beef this good. the potato ""chips"" was like a cube of all that is good w/ potatoes. the powdered A-1 was a deconstructed version of A-1 steak sauce and was a nice addition as was the salt and pepper on the side but the beef really stood on its own. lemon soda, one bite - once in your mouth, this almost becomes a bite of lemon meringue. great and playful! transparency of raspberry, yogurt bubble gum, long pepper, hibiscus, creme fraiche watermelon, lime, nasturtium - this was a thin paper of raspberry which was a fun fruit roll up type thing and a ""cigarette"" of bubble gum w/ creme fraiche that needed to be sucked from the one side and a ball of watermelon w/ lime. just a fun course! rhubarb, goat milk, onion, lavender air - a pillow filled w/ lavender air was placed in front of us and the dish was placed on top. the pillow slowly lost it's air as the plate sat and gave off this wonderful lavender aroma. The bites on the plate had a lil bit of cotton candy to drops of sweet onion. nice dish. chocolate, blueberry, tobacco, maple - the highlight of the evening. A silicone mat was placed on our table top and chef achatz prepped this on our table and every component was insanely good. here's a video of this course: http://bit.ly/vWIQS pound cake, strawberry, lemon, vanilla bean - a dense pound cake w/ strawberry in it and a lemon snow around it. the vanilla bean is used as a fork and adds a nice background flavor. lovely!"
597,"One of my resolutions for 2008 was to visit Chicago and dine at Alinea. I have dined at some of the best restaurants in America and in Europe. I can say without question that Alinea as a ""total package"" was the best restaurant I've ever been to and it was the best dining experience I ever had. As a restaurant, the design immediately puts you off balance when you enter the door and walk down an eerily quiet, narrow corridor in mauve hue and then suddenly to your surprise, like in a carnival funhouse, a sliding door quickly opens to reveal the front foyer. You immediately get a view of the bustling kitchen which is so clean it makes a hospital operating room look dirty. There is no separation between servers and chefs. All are hurrying in and out of the kitchen like worker bees on a mission. The decor of the restaurant is one like I've never seen before; multi-level and modular as if out of a geometry textbook or Frank Lloyd Wright unrealized blueprint. The service staff is a well oiled machine. There was not one misstep the whole night. The service was on the level of Pierre Gagnaire in Paris, like a ballet. Only, in Alinea's case, the catering was at a level inspired from love rather than obligation. We selected the lesser menu, but they honored a couple of requests that I made from the tour menu. Right out of culinary school Chef Grant Achatz studied at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry and then later at Ferran Adria's El Bulli in Spain. What makes Grant Achatz so great is that he has perfected the ability to completely marry the cutting edge molecular gastronomy school equally with the classic French technique making an end product that is an evolution to avant-haute cuisine. Ferran Adria of El Bulli tends to weigh more heavy on the technique and takes away from actually creating ""dishes"". Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 offers a more traditional preparation with an ""influence"" from the molecular school. Everything we tasted this night was undeniably ""food""..not just a lab experiment that was unidentifiable by sight or smell. The juxtapositions of flavors were sheer genius and the presentations completely innovative unlike I had ever seen before. Check out this wonderful video narrated by Corby Kummer of The Atlantic Monthly that will explain better because I am still beyond words. Alinea: The Elements of Taste http://www.technologyrev FoodMayhem review (same exact menu we had - dish for dish) http://www.foodmayhem.co"
598,"Simply unbelievable. Well worth the once-in-a-lifetime price. It's like fine dining meets cirque. Once I found the entrance (not obvious), the rest of the evening was just magical. I've never felt so well taken care of, so thoughtfully served or so educated by the staff."
599,"Every bite is rich, thank goodness each course is only a mouthfull. Still it was the most memorable meal I've ever had. Go for the full menu, as I doubt this is the type of place where you become a regular. A lot of people get hung up about price. If you think of it as dinner and a show, it's much more reasonable."
600,"Simply one of the most amazing culinary experiences you will ever have. Breathtaking presentation, elegant atmosphere, and wonderful food. Treasure it. Rates in my top five restaurants globally and better than anything in the US I have ever had..."
601,Black Truffles...drooling still. I cannot even express or find enough words to decribe how delicous Alinea was. I would be happy to eat scraps that fell on the floor! I am not one for the upscale -sitdown for a long time- and can't wear my jeans- dining experiance. But if you bring me back here I will do whatever you tell me to do. anything.
602,The best meal I've ever had.
603,I feel like I could either keep this brief or write 6 pages. Suffice it to say that this is a thoroughly top-notch dining experience in every dimension. My tongue got whiplash from the tastebud roller coaster of this meal. The finest of fine dining I've ever had. Pay no attention to the celebrities you will no doubt be dining with.
604,"A night at Grant Achat's Alinea ranks as one of the best meals of my life. Everything about this meal was exquisite - from the service, to the atmosphere, to the food. The French style service is extremely attentive and classy and our sommelier was very knowledgeable and chatty as we made our way through the wine paring. Be aware that the wine can drive an already large bill into the stratosphere especially as the sommelier will occasionally ""upsell"" you to a more offbeat wine. We spent $500 (without tip) for two people on the 12 course meal with wine pairings and 2 ""upsells"". I don't regret either of the occasions I chose his alternate recommendations - both were fantastic and unusual styles of familiar grapes - a Pinor Noir and a Grenache. They seem to have simplified the menu the taste (12 courses) and the tour (22-26 courses). We rolled out of there after a mere 12 courses in 4 1/2 hours. According to our waiter, the 24-ish course meal could take anywhere from 2 1/2 hours (chefs) to 7 1/2 hours (whew). The entire meal contained elements of drama that targets all the senses and you'll never be short of conversation (however long your meal is) as Chef Achat gives you plenty to talk about as he leads you though this spectacular 12 act culinary show. Some of the dramatic highlights: Hot Potato (cold potato, black truffle, and parmesan). Our first dish came in a miniature bowl with a skewer stuck through the side of the bowl on which a cold potato ball, a sliver of black truffle, and parmesan were suspended over the bowl. Our waiter instructed us to remove the skewer allowing everything to drop into a cold potato soup, which we then knocked back like a decadent shot. Lamb (akudjura, nicoise olive, eucalyptus veil). Our waiter sat a large bowl full of warm eucalyptus leaves in front of us. Nestled in the middle of this fragrant and beautiful bowl was a skewer with a cube of lamb and an olive on it. Duck (persimmon, onion, pillow of mace air). Easily the most dramatic dish. A cloth pillow filled with mace scented air was placed in front of each of us and a dish with duck confit, duck breast and fois gras was placed on top. As we dug into this dish the air was slowly released from the pillow mixing with the food smells and leading us to visions of Alinea branded mace spray for linens. UPDATE: Check out the review in Wired: http://www.wired.com/wir"
605,My girlfriend Chris and I went to Alinea in December. We did the tour and wine pairing. Our Sommelier Justin added some White Burgundy to our wines since it's my favorite. The experience was incredible and I was on an Alinea buzz for days after. The $840 check was worth it and I hope to do it again this spring or summer. My experience at Alinea far exceeded my experience at the French Laundry in California.
606,"alinea -- what an experience! first of all, we were so lucky we got reservations. from what i've read you need to make sure to book 3 months in advance! i took my boyfriend here for his birthday. and sadly, achatz wasn't there. anyway, even walking in is an experience. everything was fun and delicious, and we had great drink recommendations -- starting off with champagne. the two desserts were a little disappointing though, one being a little too peculiar and the other too sweet. roughly 350pp. but for one of the top restaurants in the world, AND for the number of courses they offer... it's a steal. our waiter was awesome. i couldn't believe after we had sat for 4 hours! they gave us nice menus after to take home. anyway, artistic presentation is impeccable, and it's interactive/playful. achatz definitely has incredible vision."
607,"Before I actually went to this place, I had hesitations that maybe this food wouldn't be super great but just super gimmicky. After going to this place, I can tell you that all the strange stuff you hear about isn't gimmicky at all. Everything that's done to food at Alinea is done to make it taste better. I loved my dinner here."
608,"Went there for our wedding anniversary and all I can say is WOW! The best dining experience of my life! From the moment we walked in, the superb service began. And when the food started coming with our chosen wine pairing, I was blown away by the complex and exciting flavors. Every piece is a work of art so everyone in the restaurant were taking pictures of the food before consuming it. Even got a chance to meet Grant Achatz. It was a perfect experience in every way. Definitely worth the $$$$"
609,"I guess you have to go once and decide for yourself (and hope someone else is picking up the tab). It is certainly an ""experience"" but IMHO, not worthy of all the praise. Call me crazy, but after spending about 9 bills on dinner and wine for 2, I expect to be satisfied. We stopped for pizza and wine on the way home."
610,"Gastronomical extravaganza. Phenomenal. Exquisite. Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience. The service was nothing the previous reviews stated. Far from pretentious, the staff was knowledgeable, even down to the bus boy who can describe the food as well as the captain. The food cannot be described by layman's terms. Favorite course was the wagyu beef pared with potato custard encrusted in salt and vinegar chips served with powdered A-1, finished with a smoking, grill scented, centerpiece. To make a long story short, you will never want to eat beef any other way again in your lifetime. Go, fly fly, experience it for yourself."
611,"This place is the most amazing 5 hours I've ever spent at a restaurant. My ex took me here for my birthday around the opening date. The service was flawless, the food was fantastic. I especially loved the filet of beef that emerged from the eucalyptus leaves. If you want to really, really, REALLY impress that someone you love, this is THE place to take them."
612,"Simply put, my 12-course meal at Alinea was the most memorable and creative dining experience I have ever had (and possibly may ever have), hands-downs. It was worth every penny. I use the word ""experience"" as opposed to meal because dinner at Alinea is more than just a meal. It was evident in the chef's and waitstaff's flawless execution that every detail has been thought of and precisely planned out, from the tableware to the presentation and delivery of the food to the consumption of the food. The food was not only a work of art but most importantly, it was delicious. When I left the restaurant, the hostess even walked me to the cab with an umbrella over my head to shield me from the rain. I look forward to the day that I can go back and have the 22-course (or is it 24-course?) meal."
613,"originally wanted a reservation on a saturday night but they were fully booked, of course. instead we got a 9pm reservation on a friday night. thank goodness we took a taxi b/c we would have never found it. there was no sign! our dinner turned out to be 4 hours b/c there were 4 of us and we were eating slow. but it was worth it all. the money. the time. the increase in inches around the waist. originally i thought there were two menus, as noted on their website, but now there is only one fixe prix menu for $185/person. for a michelin rated restaurant, is a VERY reasonable price. also it was name the #1 US restaurant in the top 50 restaurants in the world.. http://www.theworlds50be the wine pairing price changes daily as the food might change, causing the wine to change as well as the amount of wine consumed. its pretty expensive so we decided not to do the pairing. however since only two of us were drinking we went with the half bottle. we were about 1/3 into the meal and was about done with the bottle. so we ordered another. the sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable. the food was wonderful. there were so many plates that came out and of course not EVERY single one can please everyone so there were some that were better than most but each has a very different and unique taste. each plate was like an art piece. i love how they play with the taste and presentation of each dish and many of them involved human interaction. i think most of us at our table agreed most that the lamb was the best. definitely definitely would recommend this place."
614,"We went here for my mothers birthday. It was hands down the best place I have ever been to. That is saying a lot since I have been to a lot of different restaurants..... and I love to eat. The plates were all amazing and the presentation was impeccable, as was the service. They also made some special plates due to allergies of my sister. The chef is actually from my hometown and I guess we were the first people (besides his family) from his town to visit the restaurant. I would love to go here again since I am sure the menu has changed since last time I visited. Great all around place and a must for any foodie that visits Chicago."
615,"Alinea is easily the best restaurant I have ever enjoyed. The space is wonderful. Quiet with lots of room around the tables. The wait staff listen to you, make suggestions and write nothing down. An amazing show of skill! The food is endlessly engaging and provocative. Although portions are mostly one bite, by the time desert started I was full. The wine pairings were excellent. Sure it is expensive, but it is a true value."
616,"This is the best restaurant I've ever been to. Each time, the food was inventive, interesting and tasted amazing. The service was perfect: very efficient but not stuffy."
617,Quite an experience and we talked about it for weeks. I thought it would be too hoighty toighty and that I'd walk away hungry. Wrong on both accounts. Very knowledgable and friendly service. We did the wine pairing and it was totally worth it. You go through nearly every varietal of wine (from champagne to desert wines) and we never had a dry glass. I decided to see how many refills I'd get was never disappointed. Make your date happy and go with the full tasting menu and wine pairing. You probably won't be coming back for awhile so do it right.
618,"Honestly, I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. I've had the fortune of eating here twice, and while I would have given it 5 stars the first time, it was even better the second time around. Originally, when I called for a reservation, they said they only had availability for the shorter tasting menu for the date we were going. However, when we got there, they said we could get the tour after all, thank goodness. The wine pairing is very expensive but they're very flexible - I asked for an abbreviated wine pairing because I found it to be too much wine the first time I got the pairing, and they reduced the amount of each pour and also reduced the price accordingly. They also came up with a beer pairing for my beer-loving dad. As for the dishes, I thought there were a couple misses the first time I went, but this time, I loved every dish except for one (uni), and that was more a function of not generally liking uni very much. Some highlights: - pork belly with cucumbers and thai spices/dressing on iceberg; this came with a shot of lemongrass/fish sauce/other thai flavors that smelled like hell but tasted amazing - pigeonneau--Alinea is generally known for experimental/molecular gastronomy type food but they decided to throw one classical French dish in there and I'm so glad they did. This was basically a tart with squab, foie gras, onions, and mushroom and was as good as anything I've had at nice French restaurants. - sweet potato--basically a sweet potato, bourbon and brown sugar croquette served on the end of a cinnamon stick. people who had the shorter menu got this as part of the dessert but we got it in the middle - truffle explosion--they always have this on the tour, and I'm so glad they do, this might be my favorite dish. Love truffle and it's never been better than when exploding in liquid form in my mouth - this dessert that was basically a tube filled with layers of creme fraiche, hibscus jelly, and bubble gum tapioca pearls...those bubble gum tapioca pearls were definitely one of the best parts of a dessert i've ever had - they were doing a pretty new dish...basically, they cleared our whole table for the second to last course and laid down a sterile, waterproof tablecloth. then grant achatz came out with a bunch of small bowls and proceeded to create a piece of art directly onto the tablecloth. he made this picture of malted ice cream, blueberry in different textures, chocolate, and maple spheres. it was absolutely gorgeous and quite large. we completely ravished this dish. So yeah, I think this place deserved more than 5 stars despite the astronomical prices and the sometimes cold service because the food is just on a completely different level than anywhere else I've been save maybe one or two places. I've had some of the other ""best restaurants"" in the country, and I just think Alinea is so much more innovative while still remaining delicious."
619,"This is extremely expensive. I enjoy a good meal and wine more than lots of people, but this was a bit ridiculous to me. I had the 12 course with wine pairing and it was over $300 with tip for one person. I had some of the best bites of food I've ever had. Each course was very unique with presentation you only see on tv. Upon reservation they ask if there are food allergies and the staff confirms this with you when you arrive. The service left something to be desired. Our waiter said that we could try more of any wine that was paired with our food, but he was nowhere to be found. It was also hard to locate. I didn't see a sign outside, which maybe adds to the exclusive feel of it. I think if it didn't cost an arm and a leg, the service was better, and you felt more welcomed than it would have been a better experience."
620,Who ever said that money can't buy you love?
621,"My now husband, then fiance, and I went in '08 our first trip and returned last summer (09'). There has been quite a bit of talk about treatment by the staff. I believe they have a knack for reading their guest and mirroring their behavior. If you feel you received snotty service, you probably acted like you were hot shit. More than likely it's do to one of two things: you are new to fine cuisine and are trying to act as if you fit in or you have eaten it all and nothing impresses you anymore. If you are carefree and whimsical, they to will join in the laughs and become less formal. Pretentious=formal. We know because our first trip was our first truly fine dining experience. We had enjoyed some great food, but not top 50 in the world. We were trying to fit in and probably gave off a pretentious vibe. Our second trip we had eaten at The Fat Duck and La Table de Joel Robuchon to new just a few. And after seeing the others at Alinea show outward signs of delight, we learned to be ourselves and chuckle at the experience...enjoying the moment instead of taking notes of highs and lows. The staff and other customers all seemed to be a little giddy with excitement through out the evening as well. Both times we observed tables that were friendly and those which were pretentious and the service seemed tailored to your expectations. I'm just saying you get what you put out, which I believe to be the ultimate customized service experience. Also, I'll just say now that I don't care about wine, so you won't get an informed review on that topic here. I did enjoy the 4 wines we have consumed there, but I lack the words to properly describe and critique them. For me it's all about two things, the food and the experience. I can't even begin to give critiques about individual dishes as we've had over 40 now, but I'll say these few things in general: 1). It's experimental, there are hits and misses: the hit ratio for our two experiences was roughly 60-65% and we didn't always agree 2). When it hits, you'll crave it forever and be left wanting more which I see as a good thing 4). the dishes illicit discussions of nostalgia and creativity 5). The entrance is great, but the inside decor is too plain 6). You'll get to hear Achatz scream profanities at the staff from the kitchen at least once, and it's hysterical dinner entertainment (not to mention it highlights his commitment too quality and consistency) 7). It's whimsical and innovative...chill and don't expect large, rich classic french dishes 8). If you go more than once, expect a few repeats. This would be fine had they been my favorites, but they seem to be the ones I don't care for. Try and go during different seasons or you might see even more repeats. 9). I haven't been to Moto so as far as competing Chicago restaurants go, I don't know which is better. But although La Table de Joel Robuchon is the epitome of haute cuisine Alinea tops it in my book and Robuchon is second only to Achatz.. Why? I'm a fan of the long tour of tastes. Execution is key just as with French masters, but it's not the same old sauces that heavily populate the world's best restaurants. I laugh when I eat Achatz creations, and find myself craving them almost weekly. 10). Although the techniques and flavors vary greatly from others in the culinary world, Achatz definitely has his favorites that you will see reused many times. Foams, freezing, gelatins, tapiocas, food delivery devices,and others are repeated frequently and loose their initial intrigue. They are rarely used to the detriment of the flavor though, as some gastronomic chefs will overlook (So I've heard of WD-50). OVERALL: My favorite restaurant, even compared to some of the European masters!"
622,"This is the best restaurant in Chicago! The food is excellent-- innovative and beautifully presented. They also have some fantastic, very rare wines. I definitely recommend doing the wine pairings. Expensive, but worth it. It's a truly unique experience."
623,"I've been twice, and both times it was...well, everything everyone has described. The first time was 6 months after it opened, the second time was January 2007. I have 2 quick things to add to everyone else's comments. First, I am so pleased that Chef Aschatz' cancer is in remission and he will be able to taste his creations. Second, and much less importantly, I am a vegetarian which always makes me wary at the best restaurants. Elite chefs--reasonably--don't want to have to compromise and my food choices can get in the way. It's one thing to make a special request at the local greasy spoon, another thing entirely at somewhere as special as this. I've had to eat plain noodles at world-class restaurants before. However, Alinea was just as amazing for me as it was for the other people in my party (I had told them there would be a vegetarian in the party in advance, which I think is always a good idea). Everything was amazing. Most of the creations were modified versions of what my husband got, some were completely different (and, I suspect, pulled from the menu with more courses). My wine pairings were excellent and the whole experience was as perfect as I had hoped."
624,I have been lucky enough to eat at some of the best resturants in the world but this place still stands above the rest. The best and meal I have ever had!
625,"This place is an experience everyone should have at least once. The service was exceptional, the food unique and delicious. My favorites were the pea soup, green tea dessert, and the bacon with caramel. I was joking around with the waiter about getting an empty vessel instead of the bacon and they brought the whole table out another round! The wine pairings were perfect. My only complaint would be that the final dessert--the art on the mat--had too much overpowering mint in it. Overall, an amazing experience."
626,shame on me for never reviewing alinea. i really have nothing new to add to my fellow yelpers' reviews. dining here truly is an experience of a lifetime. and the sommelier has the best hairdo ever. can't wait for NEXT restaurant to open its doors!
627,"if i rated for chef creativity, food presentation and service, this would get as many stars as possible. but i write about the whole experience and 3 stars was the impression i left with. first of all, i don't think a 20-course menu should be offered. if i can finish watching avatard and schindler's list in the time it took to eat this meal, dinner is too long. everyone at our table took like 3 bathroom breaks. we clocked 5'45"" and were itching to get out for the last 3 hrs. i don't think anything i ate made me think staying so long was worth the wait. i think a lot of it is quite kitschy, like a disney world of dining. there's a lot of drama in the presentation like having the customer or staff assemble things, funky serving contraptions. obviously a lot of thought and creativity goes into creating the dishes. extracting flavors in different ways (one dish was a liquid drink version of thai chili, lemongrass, and fish sauce), presenting food in unconventional forms (lots of gelees, one that sticks out in my mind was foie gras pressed thru chinoise so it was little pellets). playing up to sensory appeal, like having a bowl of juniper stems with a goose mcnugget skewered at the end of one (so the diner enjoys the juniper aroma), or the pillow filled with early grey tea so the aroma releases after the plate is placed on top. it's cool and all but does my food taste better? i think a lot of the dishes have too much going on but some of them do hash the flavors together very nicely. i think my favorite dish may have been sturgeon dressed with smoked apple sheet and fluid gel smoke. when it came out i had no idea what was going on on the plate but then i just started scooping stuff up and it was tasty. a couple items made with alcohol were completely too strong. mid-meal was a passion fruit rum, chartreuse sugar cube and kumquat sazerac. they told us each item got stronger but i think i got instant drunk on the kumquat. i was also a little disappointed by the last course of the day, an eggnog nugget. i almost threw up when i ate it and would have preferred something light and less toxic to end. the 2nd to last dessert, the table was covered in silicone sheets and the chef came out and did table art for a few minutes with chocolate sauce, menthol creme, coconut mousse, chewy coconut chunks, choco mousse frozen in liquid nitrogen, and other edible embellishments. it was pretty to watch but after 5.5 hrs, we just kinda wanted to leave. like any of the other top restaurants nationwide, this is worth a visit. there are a lot of interesting things done with the food--but remember when the volcano onion at benihana was cool? i feel like the food might seem better because we're told it's manipulated this way and that. i would possibly go back if there was a 3 or 5-course tasting. random tidbit, alinea is the editing symbol for a new paragraph. the start of a new thought. the logo for the restaurant is the old school symbol for alinea."
628,"The experience was really cool! Worth the $$$$. I wouldnt do the 4 hour meal again, but i would do the shorter one. The kobe beef course was cool- they delivered it hung and in dry ice then it thawed on the table to eat. Pretty cool. Wine pairings were great too."
629,"There really isn't much to say about this place that has not already been said on here, so i am not going to drone on about every course in detail. I will say that Alinea was the most mindblowing experience i have ever had involving food. The attention to detail is immaculate from the food, to the service, to the overall atmosphere. All of the unique little apparati that are used in place of plates and utensils were so cool. Apparently the chef has them made just for him. Food is quite simply turned on its ear. After a while you feel as if you are becoming numb to surprise, but then dish number 20 comes out and you are, yet again, blown away. There are flavor combinations that you would never imagine would ever go together, but chef knows how to make it work! Case in point: lobster, lychee, ginger and gruyere cheese dipped in tempura and fried onto a vanilla bean?!?! wtf!! This was our second course, mind you, and we were simply perplexed by that fact that we not only thought it tasted good, but that it tasted amazing! It was even more amazing that all of the flavors had their distinct ""window"" as it moved across the pallet. It was never muddled. I might also add that the smell (vanilla bean), texture and temperature were also perfect. The rest of the dishes followed a similar suit. Never dull, always surprising and always delicious. during the final course, they really pull out the big guns. I won't tell you what it is, but i can tell you that it is the only time i have ever whipped out my camera and taken video of my dessert being made. The service was nothing short of exceptional. You dont really have a waiter, but more a wait staff. There are no bus boys, there is simply a crew of people that know everything about your meal, keeping careful eye on any of your potential needs are desires. One would think that a restaurant of this caliber would have a somewhat stuffy, if not pretentious wait staff, but this was totally not the case. They definitely walked around with an air of ""i work at THE SHIT restaurant"", but, yet there is something very personable about everyone that waited on us. We knew everyone by name by the end of the experience, and they were able to joke around with you and indulge in mindless small talk, all while staying totally on their game and not skipping a beat. When a glass was empty, it was taken off the table within 10 seconds. When a course was finished, the ""dishes"" were immediately taken away. Every time a dish was taken away, another course was there in front of you in less than 5 minutes. When you are leaving the restaurant, one of the waiters hails a cab for you. Truly amazing from start to finish. As far as price goes......yeah, its gonna hurt. That said, its totally worth the money. You are not just paying for food, but for an all encompassing experience. I know it sounds like i am exaggerating, but it is just THAT out of this world. Just go. Do it. Get the tour ($225) and the wine pairing (75% of that), and live life to the fullest for 4 hours. If you are going to go, do it right, because, lets face it, you aren't going back any time soon. PS - Black Truffle Explosion is simply orgasmic. I have thought about it every single day for the last week and a half"
630,"Words cannot do this restaurant justice. I know many people have written reviews on this place, from critics to foodies, but the bottom line is everyone needs to try this place...not just once, but once per season to get a good idea exactly how special this place really is!!!"
631,"The food, amazing. It's definitely worth the cost to have this experience at least once in my lifetime. I was expecting amazing food, but I wasn't expecting our waiter to be such an educated, interesting person to talk to."
632,"my 100th review. seems like just yesterday i was a noob yelper, putting my 2 cents out there for the interwebz to see. its been a great year yelping and i figure id end on the highest of high notes. at first i was going to review yelp for my 100th review. but that shiz is played out. i am going to review the best dining experience of my life for my 100th review. neither alinea nor its mastermind chef need my public adoration. afterall chef achatz has already been bestowed the best restaurant in north america and the #7 best restaurant in the world honors for alinea. it was an honor to eat here. i dont need to break down the courses. every other reviewer has done so. you dont need to look at my pictures because there are far more artful and better looking ones out there (ill put my pictures up because i took the time to take them). however, i will tell you that you need to experience alinea. if you live in chicago and havent eaten here yet, what are you waiting for? if you live anywhere else in the country plan a trip around this restaurant. chicago is a beautiful city with amazing food--none better than alinea. it will be worth every penny. i tried for so long to figure out what to write here and in the end anything that i say will do a disservice to the food. it would also do a disservice to the chefs and the servers who labored to make my meal as enjoyable as it could be. it was four hours of sheer amazement. and if you are as lucky as i was chef achatz will plate your final course table side. alinea is the reason that yelp should expand to a 6 star review system. plain and simple."
633,"Best meal of my life. Can't possibly describe the courses and do them the justice they deserve. Had the option of adding a white truffle risotto course and was not at all disappointed. If given the option, you must have this dish! The presentation was really impressive without feeling too flashy or like a show. Amazing. Worth every penny."
634,"I think I just ate in OUTER SPACE! This place was totally surreal. AMAZING! I don't know what to say except, YOU MUST GO! Too much to explain and talk about. I'm confused? Totally freeking AWESOME!"
635,"This is truly a dining EXPERIENCE. We had a party of 5 and we all opted for the ""Tour"", which was 27 courses. The other 4 members of the party all have many years of experience within the food/restaurant industry (3 restaurant owners and 1 executive chef) under their belts. From the outside, this restaurant doesn't appear as anything special, as it is situated behind an unmarked entrance. Upon entering, there's a narrow, dimly lit corridor. At the end, another door automatically opened, allowing one to enter the restaurant. The kitchen was full of artists, carefully leaned over the stainless-steel tables, creating their masterpieces. The service was excellent, which was up to par with what was expected. They were extremely attentive to the activity of the table, as no course was served until all parties were present at the table. When one person left the table, it was almost as if everything was to cease. Their knowledge of everything being served was impressive, as they were able to explain each course served. The food...a-mazing. There were certainly some flavor combinations to which I was not accustomed, as each course offered something different, inventive. These are flavors and ""results"" which have been carefully considered of the fusion created. The food isn't cooked in the sense that you just taste a blend of everything mixed together. Rather, you an taste each of the specific flavors involved in the individual course. The courses were surprising, as some were solid foods, while others were purely liquid, or even simply in the form of foam. I did manage to taste every single course, which were all delicious, against my stomach's wish to be pushed to its limits. Highly recommended, as this will open your eyes/palate to food as an art form and more."
636,"I found my favorite restaurant in the world. I travel extensively and have had the great fortune of eating at some of the top restaurants in the world. This restaurant by far was the most flavorful, artistic and fun. I took my parents here for their 60th birthdays. I have never seen them laugh so much during a meal. This was their first experience with this type of food and with it being very interactive kept them busy and inquisitive for 6 hours. I hope to return for my Birthday."
637,"if i could give alinea more than 5 stars, i totally would. but alas, that is not an option. this review is long overdue. i came here with a close friend for my birthday last year (october 2008), and it was beyond all my expectations. and really it's beyond anything i can describe. yes it's very expensive but it's one of those things that if you have the money, i definitely recommend trying because it is such an experience. from the moment i walked in the door, everyone was attentive and there to make my experience an amazing one. the food was more than wonderful and more than just a meal. all the wine pairings were spot on as well. we did the 12 course and left pretty full but not so full we needed to be rolled out the door. grant achatz signed our menus at the end of the night, and that's going on my wall!"
638,"My husband and I received a gift card here as a wedding gift. It took a couple of months to get a reservation but the wait was worth it. I think we can both say that it was an amazing experience and the food was phenomenal. Its impossible to describe what the meal was like unless you have experienced it yourself. If you are celebrating something special and you have the cash to do it, I would recommend going to this one of a kind place. The meal was unforgettable!"
639,"Ok, I'm going to split this into two parts. The ""experience"" and the food. Did the Tour with the wine pairings. Experience wise, I'd give this place 5 stars. The atmosphere, the level of service, the presentation, are all perfect as you would expect. This is an experience that few will ever see a glimpse. Now to the food. The food is definitely different and covers a wide range of flavors, and for innovation I would give it a 5. That said, I can honestly say its not the most amazing meal I've ever had. I'd rate the food on a pure taste level a 2, and since alinea is a restaurant, i feel the food is what i should rate(gave it 1 more star because of the experience). I feel a lot of these reviews that give 5 stars, and comment that this is the most amazing place outstanding, etc are people who are just too scared to admit they just dropped a considerable chunk of change on food that actually didn't taste good, or their rating the experience. I will probably never go here again unless someone is paying for me. During our meal I can honestly say we were the youngest people there, and probably having the most fun. Sat on the second floor, in the back corner for two. Alinea is in its own price range, but others I would consider in place of Alinea would be Moto, or for a downright deal I love Bonsoiree(BYOB)."
640,"If you are reading Alinea reviews on Yelp you need to just suck up your nerve and go. It's expensive, pretentious, and worth your time. I have eaten better food but never seen more creative ways to prepare and serve it. The overall experience is fascinating. The service staff (hard to call them waiters) performs a subtly choreographed placement and pickup. Each dish is engineered rather than prepared. You won't find a more interesting way to wile away four hours."
641,"Alinea is grown-up entertainment for the adventurous palate. We had the 12 course tasting menu, and almost every bite was amazing and wonderful. There were a couple of dishes that kind of fell flat (dessert isn't really their forte) but even at $600 for two people, I felt I got my money's worth. Absolutely creative and delicious and amusing - you could feel the chef's playfulness in some dishes, his nostalgia in others. The service was excellent and friendly, explaining how to approach certain dishes with unusual presentation (bacon on a wire, anyone?) without talking down to us. Since our meal, we have tried to reproduce certain dishes (or at least use flavor elements in simpler dishes) because the memory of the meal is just so damn good. We don't look like your typical fine dining couple, but we were treated with respect and the whole experience is one I wish I could repeat often."
642,"I had no idea what this place was about as I was in Chicago on a quick business trip and was asked to join some friends and colleagues last minute. It's incredible! By far the best restaurant I've been to. Looking at the menu and prices, you try very hard to find something wrong with it, however, it's simply just fantastic. For the six of us, the bill was easily over $2k, so be prepared to fork over the card!"
643,My girlfriend took me here two years ago. It was truly a unique experience. I recommend everyone to try this place once in their lifetime. It's science meets culinary art. We had the grand course meal with the wine pairing. I suggesting doing the wine pairing since you're already over budget. What's another $200. I highly recommend this place if you can afford it.
644,"When one of our waiters referred to the vanilla mascarpone roll as ""crack cocaine"", I knew I was in heaven. Ridiculous food, even better service."
645,"One of the best meals I have ever had. Great flavors, very inventive molecular gastronomy, impeccable wait staff. Would go back in a heartbeat!"
646,"After my first dinner at Alinea, I wrote the following in my dining notes: ""I just got back from the longest meal I think I've ever eaten."" Alinea is another hot new Chicago restaurant offering immersion in post-modern cuisine. There's a (no longer) recent review that actually highlights a lot of the cuisine that I sampled that night -- and sampling it was, as we went for the ""tour,"" which that night was a 26-course tasting menu that lasted five hours. It was worth the hype and every penny, however; it's simply a phenomenal place. Many courses were ""really good"" or better; the consistency was unexpectedly high throughout the entire meal. Perhaps my favorite course was squab in mushroom soup with foie gras foam, the extra details of which I could not recall at this moment I wrote the review up (it was simply too difficult to keep in my head; unlike moto, there are no printed menus from which to pull notes, and I didn't keep a notebook with me through dinner). I've been a fan of Grant Achatz's since his tour at Trio in Evanston; as seems to be the pattern (set perhaps by Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand when they went off to start Tru), a fair number of the highly-skilled waitstaff there were from the old days of Trio. Service was precise and elaborate; the room was modern and gorgeous -- the entryway is simply amazing in and of itself! Although the food did not peak at the levels that moto peaked at, I felt it was more consistent (though not due to a lack of experimentation and risk) and still ended up placing Alinea as one of the five best restaurants in Chicago today. (If you're looking for the other four in my highly-subjective, highly-opinionated, ephemeral list: Moto, the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carleton, Charlie Trotter's, and Les Nomades.) Yes, $175 is a hefty price for a tasting menu -- but what a tasting menu! It's also perfectly in line with the other new stellar greats in the US, such as per se in New York, and is in fact perhaps ""a deal"" when compared to Alain Ducasse's restaurant at the Essex House or many of the stunning French restaurants or Michelin three star restaurants out there. The bottom line? If you are a lover of exciting, dynamic, and post-modern cuisine (and live in the Chicagoland area) -- make a reservation (which you'll need to do well in advance) and go. The next spring, on April 5 (my little personal historical marker of terrestrial position with respect to the sun), we went back. That time was notable in two extra ways: first, I did the wine flight along with the tour; second, I got a copy of the menu to take home as a keepsake (a little thing I like to do sometimes -- call me sentimental, I guess). So I figured I'd just share the menu and review it as best as I could remember (bearing in mind that I was already up past my bedtime and was barely staying awake even as I type this), before too much time passed and I lost the thread of it entirely. I was far too tired that night to attempt such a herculean feat. Even with memory fading, it took all the free time I had over the course of two four days. [Yelp has a 5000 character limit, so I had to erase the dish-by-dish review from here.] In short, was this the best meal I had ever had? Absolutely not. I have had meals of pure perfection at Charlie Trotter's and Daniel's. Was this in the next level down? Absolutely. It's a great experience, with some stellar, amazing, wonderful, exceptional food, and some incredibly good dishes. (And one stinker that second time.) Was it worth the $175 tour price? Absolutely, if you're into the finest kind of dining adventure. Was the wine flight worth it? Yes, but only on special occasions (but then, I don't drink much any more anyway). In this case: absolutely. A memorable meal, a nice evening, a gorgeous room and building. Oh, and as opposed to last time: this one only took four hours. Record time! I could have written more, or found more links for the wines, or any number of things, but it had already taken a week, and I felt like if I take any more time, it might never get out. So: I'd love to hear specific questions or feedback; leave comments, and I'll respond in kind. (This is a hybrid of two reviews I originally posted on 16 September 2005 and 12 April 2006.)"
647,"As good as it gets! is yelp's definition of five stars. I don't think I have ever written a five star review for which that is so thoroughly true. I came to Chicago, 7 months pregnant (so the last vacation for awhile!) specifically to eat here. And was I ever satisfied! It's probably lucky for me that Alinea is in Chicago and not San Francisco, or else I would blow way way way too much money here on a regular basis."
648,"interesting dishes, impeccable service(with the exception of a snooty waiter), entertaining sommelier, spectacular dessert/show, and, a nifty entrance all for only $1100 for 4.(2 of us didnt get the wine pairing). would i do it again? nah"
649,"I don't know if I can do justice to the experience (not just the food experience) that occurred the night we went, so I'm not going to try. Although, there was this one dish that I particularly want to emphasize: The second course of the evening came with a ""thai distillation"" that the kitchen distilled itself from lemongrass, thai chilies, and fish sauce. I caught a whiff and almost shed a tear because I could not believe just how much it smelled of home. It was the perfect encapsulation of everything beautiful about Thailand - in liquid form. A perfectly clear liquid so smooth and packed with so much memory-conjuring emotion. My fellow diner took a whiff and nodded his head urgently in agreement. If someone asked me to describe why Thailand is so amazing, I would simply hand them a shot of that distillation. It brought me home, tickled my amygdala in the brain that controls emotions and activated an undeniable homesickness that I have never experienced in food. I would strongly suggest, like other reviewers, to go with the ""tasting"" menu for your first time...it really is A LOT of food especially with the wine pairings. The dinner was such an experience it was worth every. single. penny."
650,"Outstanding menu and certainly worthy of the accolades. I feel I would be repeating the 5 star reviews. Thus, I'll leave some advice if you are thinking of dining here. One, don't be shy to take a picture of the food. It is definately worthy of your FB or Flickr page. Two, if you are driving, drive slowly when you are north bound on Halsted because it can be difficult to spot. Three, the meal is an event within itself . So don't try to couple it with a Steppenwolf play. Lastly, if you don't do the wine pairing, talk to the somelier for suggestions. A poor pairing can ruin the meal."
651,"I Had the Tour menu and the wine pairing that's the best why to really know what Alinea is all about. Everything was out of this world! and I loved all the dishes and all the wines. I didn't like that Chef Grant Achatz was NOT cooking that night (Thursday march 11) but he runs a good crew, so everything came out just fine. The pork belly is what I really enjoyed. I still have dreams about that playful dish."
652,"I will just be repeating what everyone else here as said--it was amazing. We went for my 30th birthday, planned the trip to Chicago solely to eat at Alinea. It was great and well worth it. The dishes that stand out to me are the English Pea, the hot potato cold potato, the truffle explosion and the Short rib beggar's purse. All 19 courses were very good, some were mind blowing. We did not do the wine pairing, we had one bottle of pinot noir and our bill was about $730 for 2 people. Definitely the most money I have ever spent on a meal, but worth it. Go if you get the chance. The only bad thing--my husband and I feel spoiled now. We went to some other restaurants in Chicago and they just did not compare."
653,Was here for my b'day. This place does not disappoint. Absolutely worth every penny. The wine pairing is perfect to be shared by two. Else you are bound to get drunk! Service/design/food/decor was impeccable. Do not think twice before dining here!
654,"excellent, but I can't say that it knocked me off my feet. I had high expectations if this place, and while they were met, they were not exceeded. some of the dishes were not very pretty in my 12 course meal. for example, the chocolate dessert looked like pooh on a plate. But some of the dishes were incredible. Overall a very nice dining experience. I like how they kept topping off my wine during each course (some restaurants are pretty cheap when it comes to the wine pairings), but for the $90 extra you are paying, I guess it's should be expected. I also thought that $7 for a cup of coffee is just insane. Did they roast the coffee themselves?! Geez."
655,Food was just a little too science laboratory for us. But we will definitely not forget the experience....and I guess that is what this place is all about.
656,Obviously the food is very interesting. Had a very nice time. Absolutely worth the experience to go once but I don't think it is worth the expense to go again and again.
657,"My dining experience at Alinea absolutely blew me away. I have dined at some of the finest dining establishments in Chicago, but nothing compares to Alinea. It took 1, 2 months to get a table, and the place was slightly difficult to find, considering that there are no signs outside with the restaurant name (from the outside it looks like someone's house). We went with the smaller tasting menu (still had over 10 courses though), and had the wine pairing. Every single dish was like a piece of art, and there were plenty of surprises. Some of the dishes were in solid form, but once you pop it into your mouth, they immediately turn into liquid. Chef Achatz is just amazing! Service was also very good, like a well-oiled machine. As soon as we finished a dish, it was promptly removed, and soon afterwards the next course would appear. Our servers were very knowledgeable of the food and wines. Many of the courses were really small in portion, but at the end of the night (after 4+ hours), we were stuffed. A true once in a lifetime experience."
658,"Well, this is a place to save for a night that you truly have time to take in the experience. I think that the numerous small plates you sample throughout the night are each a little bit like a piece of art. You almost need to study each plate and take time to appreciate the nuances. That said, I would not show up here starving and hoping for a satisfying meal. If you want that, I'd go out for a nice steak! You'll have to patiently wait for each small mini-course to make its way to your table. The only reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars is that I thought the somber demeanor of the servers got a bit old. I'm sure they are told to act ""professional,"" and thus they don't crack a smile. I also got really sick of being chased by the servers every single time I got up to use the restroom- apparently customers are not allowed to be troubled with opening the bathroom door by themselves:)"
659,"If you want a really unique meal and don't mind shelling out the dough, come to Alinea. It was a one of a kind experience, and I thought the food was fabulous. We had the 12 course meal, and it was definitely filling enough. It also took us nearly 4 hours, and I can't imagine how long the 24 course meal would have taken. The only negative I found was that the waitstaff definitely hovered, making it a little difficult to have a conversation without feeling awkward. Even so, worth it once."
660,"What can you say, it's unique, unbeatable dining. My mother is on a low-glycemic diet for medical reasons, and the staff accommodated by replacing white wheat flour in the dishes. The sommelier was (of course) helpful and knowledgeable."
661,"Absolutely incredible - one of the best, if not THE best, meal I have ever had. I assumed I would not LOVE this place, because of my (slight) aversions to molecular gastronomy and multihour, dozen+ course dinners. Alinea won me over big time. First of all the food, while often extremely unique and sometimes bizarre, was always delicious. And their focus on aromas as well as taste (with incredible showmanship around the delivery of the aromas!) was something I have never experienced before and was such a treat (and really did add to the experience). Really just a miraculous meal. The service was PERFECT. And I have to strongly disagree with one reviewers' comments that the staff was stiff - they were absolutely not when we were there. Professional and knowledgable to the utmost, but also relaxed and funny - especially one gentleman named Marlin (I think). He was a true pleasure. Five stars through and through. I will be back when I am next in Chicago - wild horses couldn't keep me away."
662,"All I say is WOW! This is my second time after the Chef was diagnosed with cancer and now in remission. This is truly amazing, nothing compares with the ingenuity and service here. Definitely the number one restaurant in the US!"
663,Walt Disney World for your mouth!:-) VERY EXPENSIVE!!!
664,"First the facts... - Dinner lasted almost 4 hours. We were seated at 5:45 for a 6:00 reservation (we weren't the first ones in the restaurant). They don't have a bar. - We had around 17 courses. The menu that's currently online is pretty much what we were served. - About 1/3 to half of the courses didn't require silverware to eat. Many were single bite meals and we also had some ""shooters"" from either clam shells or a test-tube. Fingerfoods at Alinea...our kids would have been right at home. - One of us had the wine pairing which they kindly printed on the menu that we were given at the end of the meal to take home...adds about 3/4 of the meal price to the bill. - We sat on the ground floor which is the smaller dining room. The main one is on the second floor. - The kitchen is also on the ground floor and visible from the bathroom entrance - I witnessed no less than 15 chefs in the kitchen including the mastermind himself plating dishes. The kitchen was very quiet. Everyone knew what they were supposed to be doing. - We saw two people in a small room between the bathroom door and kitchen whose full time job appeared to be washing dishes (they use a lot in the service) - Waitstaff were everywhere...all men. The only woman was the hostess. But I think there were some women chef in the kitchen. - Most expensive meal we've ever had (by far) but the occasion made it well worth it. Now the subjective stuff... - I felt like I witnessed and experienced the product of a man who was part chef, part chemist, part artist, part mad scientist. The man is simply brilliant. - The presentation was really unique for each course - Malaysian driftwood? test tubes? vanilla bean as a eating utensil? - The food itself, was very good. Some of the course were definitely better than others. But the sheer number of courses made it hard for me to appreciate any cohesiveness to the meal. While I was able to judge the flavor of each course on its own, I left feeling like I had 17 small bites instead of 1 glorious meal. - Definitely worth the experience but I would only recommend to people who had the right expectations. If you're only focused on the food, don't go. It's not just about the food. It's about the art, the creativity and the vision of one man translated into the setting, food, presentation and service. If you go in with that expectation and can appreciate the experience for all of that, then I think you will not be disappointed."
665,"My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening for the tour, yes all 26 dishes. While the food was generally good it was the experience that could not be beaten. There were genuine moments that I was astonished that vegetables or fruit or whatever could be transformed into something else yet retain the original flavor, however, the reason I've giving four stars is because I felt that too many of the dishes were ""foamed"" or ""freeze dried"" or ""jellied"" We didn't opt for the wine parings, but had the occasional glass of wine. I did have a great time, and it was so much fun anticipating what the next dish would contain. There were some dishes that I thought were amazing, like the hot potato cold potato, then there were some dishes that were not such as Tomato, as I was not a fan of the freeze dried mozzarella. However, we left completely stuffed and generally had a great experience. The staff was awesome, so knowledgeable and helpful. 4 hours later the final bill including tip came to just under $800, and was definitely worth it."
666,"I have been there 4 times now and each time is absolutely amazing. Each time he comes up with new and brilliant ideas for the food. Yes, its pricey and it takes a long time for the 12 or 20 course meals but its so worth it for the quality food and service. Staff definitely much friendlier than other upscale restaurants."
667,"The best, most exciting meal I have ever experienced. Well worth the price."
668,"If your looking for a high end, gastronomic experience than this is it. Chef Achatz has done it again and does it right. Creative & innovative, intimate & comfortable, this is the place to try food like you've never tried before!"
669,"Alinea lives up to the hype. The whole artistic dining experience is like being in another world! Plus, one of the servers looks exactly like Johnny Depp. Highlights: Entering the restaurant. It's like going through the wardrobe into Narnia, but with automatic silver doors and artistic lighting. The food and its presentation, especially the one-bite tempura-ed shad Roe, the compile-your-own pork belly spring roll, the duck in chamomile foam, and the earl grey and white chocolate dessert (served on an Earl Grey Creme pillow. Why don't they sell those at Pottery Barn?? The aroma was heavenly.) Their allergy accommodations: they made delicious substitutions and were careful to understand exactly what I could and could not eat. The wine pairings: all the wines are unique and have an interesting story behind them. They don't seem to encourage it, but one tasting is probably enough for two. If you split it in two glasses, they will probably charge you a little more because ""it will be 2/3 of what we usually pour"" instead of half and half. The sommelier is young with crazy hair (I wanted to ask him what he put in his hair to make it stay like that) but he grew on me because he is excited about presenting the individual stories of the wines. He speaks colloquially like most people in their twenties do, which makes him seem less formal and robotic than some of the staff. (I can see how the staff could come across as pretentious, but it's really just their job to guide you through the dining experience as it has been specifically designed in a fashion in keeping with the upscale atmosphere.) Bottom line: If you can afford this luxury dining experience with no guilt, you enjoy food and wine, you're open to trying new things and won't pick out all the ingredients you normally don't like (""Ew I hate asparagus and sweetbreads! I can't eat this!!""), and you understand that this is about more than just the food (the pillow is for clean utensils, and you drink the Thai flavors in a shot. Roll with it.) then go and have an incredible time!"
670,"What else can be said about Alinea? The whole experience was gorgeous, theatrical, exciting, surprising, etc, and on and on. Service was formal without being overly stuffy (for the most part), and the food was as delicious as I've heard it is. My only complaint: for the second to last course, every table around us got Grant Achatz paining on their table cloth with chocolate and coconut, but we were only given a normal presentation of mousse on plates and no Achatz. Why? Maybe because one of my dining companions was asking a lot of questions during the meal and the didn't want him distracting the chef? Who knows. Still, it was a fabulous experience. The Earl Grey dessert course kind of blew my mind."
671,"I had a lucky of enjoy it!! WoW such a great diner!! excellent service, extraordinary food!! everything is so perfect!!"
672,"We went to celebrate our 21st anniversary. A special place for a special occasion! Arriving at the non-descript entrance, you know you are in for a great meal when the door opens and you walk down a narrow angular corridor lit with soft red light that seems to come from somewhere far off in the distance. You turn into the restaurant and walk into a high ceilinged foyer with a view of the kitchen. It's a dramatic compression and release. The kitchen is a bustle of activity - perhaps 20 chefs and cooks working. We are escorted to the front room where there about 7 tables. The rest of the restaurant is not visible from here, but I heard there are about 20 tables. We are asked a few questions before the meal starts. These concern any food intolerances and our alcohol preferences. There are two different wine pairings - the standard and the reserve. The standard is 3/4 the price of the food and the reserve is the same price as the food. I decided to have the standard pairing. My wife decided to have a glass of Pinot Gris from Alsace. We told them we will eat anything. We were served 20+ courses. To describe each one would be too much. But there were some definite highlights. The ""hot potato, cold potato"" is a whimsical little treat - a cold truffled potato soup over which is floating hot globes of butter poached Yukon gold potatoes and shaved black truffle skewered with an accupuncture needle. You pull the needle out and the potatoes drop into the cold soup and then you pour the whole thing into your mouth like a shot. Wow! What a contrast of hot and cold, smooth and chunky, and the flavor lasts in your mouth seemingly forever. The ""truffle explosion"" is a delicate raviolo filled with black truffle essence ... a xiao long bao on steroids! Each course challenged you with it's inventiveness, complexness, playfulness, interactiveness, artfulness, hauteness. Every dish is plated in a unique way, with some of the plates custom made by an engineer specfically for the dish at hand. Our final dessert was memorable. Our table is covered by a clean vinyl tablecloth and the dessert is assembled by a pastry chef directly on the table. Dollops and balls of this and that, a miraculously congealing chocolate sauce, and then a liquid nitrogen frozen block of chocolate mousse that is fractured into small smoky pieces - it's like eating a personalized Jackson Pollock painting. The wines were excellent and there were several interesting and little known varietals that were served. The service was impeccable, attentive and prompt. This kind of food and drink requires a dedicated, coordinated and fully engaged waitstaff. The courses came out without a glitch and without undue delay. We finished our entire meal in about 3 hours. This was quite a memorable dinner, probably the most memorable dinner I've eaten. There's no way of getting around the expense of this meal but if you can do it, it's worth it."
673,"I'll make this quick...this was the best birthday dinner I've ever had. From the moment we walked in I was incredibly impressed by the service and ambiance of Alinea. Dinner was served over the course of 4 hours (which may seem long but we were enjoying ourselves, were in no rush, and probably extended the process) and each course was more inspired than the next (and there are quite a few courses). All I have to say is the food was AMAZING. You'd have to go yourself because anything I type won't do it justice. The chef even mailed a sign copy of the menu to me (at my request)."
674,Went here when it opened a couple years ago and it is still my top dining experience.
675,"Service was amazing and gracious. Well, food... need I say more? It is hard, sometimes, to pack enough flavor in tasting portions since they are so small, and I know chefs would season these dishes more heavily with salt to emphize flavors. There was none of that going on here. At Alinea the flavor of the ingredients shine, and half way through the meal I raised my head and said, ""Man, this guys are not shy on flavors."" The food was fun, exciting and emotionaly stirring. My wife and I were giggling through the entire meal like little school girls. We even got the chef to sign our menu (f'ing tourists...) and tour the kitchen. Our experience at Alinea was the highlight of our trip to Chicago. There was one thing though: at the price we were paying for for a 12 course tasting menu (4/15) I was expecting a little more luxury ingredients. But the interesting concept and execution of every dish more than made up for the lack of caviars and foie gras and abalone. Thank you chef and staff for an amazing experience."
676,"I came here with the hubs for my bday in January... yeah, I know my review is late, sorry! Anyway, the food was unbelievable. When you dine here, it's for the experience and to appreciate technique and flavor. You don't come here to chow down - almost all of the plates are one or two bites. My favorites included the kobe beef w/ the deconstructed a-1 sauce and the pork belly confit - so delicious I still dream about it. We had the tour (took about 4.5 hours) and the split wine pairings - however, it's not really split, more like small pours (which was more than enough), which they were kind enough to explain. The service is quite remarkable - we expected it to be a bit snotty, but everyone was really nice and friendly. My advice for anyone going here: do the wine pairings. It is so worth it. You are already spending a lot to eat here, do it right and get the wine!"
677,"I can't say that I loved every single course (there were 24 of them!), but I loved most of them and I loved the whole experience. They are amazingly creative with their dishes, both in flavors and in presentation. And the wine pairing was fantastic and spot on. The service was also impeccable...down to the last detail. I noticed that every time I used the bathroom, someone went in after to re-fold the ends of the toilet paper and empty the trash...so each person gets a completely fresh bathroom. It's certainly worth the experience...but maybe just once. Given the price tag on a dinner for two, I think we'll probably try a different restaurant next time we want to spend a thousand dollars on dinner."
678,"Oh mah gawd. The hot potato/cold potato. The rosemary scent filled pillow. The wine. The Truffle soup dumpling. The service. The specially crafted and designed table ware. If I lived in the Chi, I would be a regular. I'd be broke, but I'd be a regular. Worth every penny."
679,"A true foodie heaven. Small, artful, and luscious dishes that tantalize the palette. I am from the Bay Area, but love coming here when in Chicago. The 12 course menu is very filling and the kitchen does a great job of adjusting to individual needs (one in our group had an allergy and one did not eat red meat) ."
680,"Mind-blasting: The last course. Do not read online about any of the courses. (Kudos if you get the reference in this line) Fantastic: The service, 25% of the courses. Great & Inventive: Pretty much every other course. Okay: The sky-high price. (But hey, you only live once)"
681,Truly one of the best dining experiences ever! Have dined here four times and each time is just as good an experience!
682,"Wonderful experience. It waiters are very attentive, very professional and very knowledgeable about what is being served. The food was amazing. I recommend you try it at least once, may break the bank but worth it in my book if you like to try something new. The menu is awesome and they matched the drinks, food and bread choice up perfectly. The dry ice thing was cool to. My sister and I were there since she had a conference and I was tagging along. We did the 12 course with the drink pairings. Worth a shot at least once in your life time if you are in Chicago."
683,"If you can save your cash and justify a meal for the ages then call and make the rez. Alinea will not dissapoint. Do your homework, if you must but this is a WORLD CLASS dining experiance. I consider myself fortunate not only to have eaten at Alinea but dually fortunate to have such a place in my city."
684,"Ambiance was okaybut the service was excellent, the cuisine was innovative, challenging and playful, and the wine-pairing was almost spot on. I went there for my 22 birthday and somtime around thanksgiving. First time was difficult to secure a reservation (3 weeks in advance) but on the second time, my reservation was booked on a saturday night 4 days in advance. Both times, the receptionist was very nice about the booking. Entering in Alinea, I was immediately waited on every second of the way til I walked out the door. The server to table ratio is 1.5 :1 which is awesome. They seem to know when to talk and when to shut up, when to bring a meal out and when to wait a little longer. They were very polite and patient in explaining each course and wine flavor complementing it, the emotions it was supposed to invoke, etc. as I was not familiar with the culinary lingo. I would definately recommend the larger course and the wine pairing with. Their menus change constantly and its never the same two dishes. I wont go too much in detail with the dishes but experiencing it was worth the price to eat there. The wine pairing is a near perfect compliment to the dishes also. The whole experience, 20 some courses, lasted a good 5 hours and I was comfortably full in between. Overall, i recommend going there at least once if you live in chicago. Its not one of the best restaurants in US for nothing."
685,"i SO wanted to give this place five stars being a chi-town native AND for the wait and the expense but sorry they only get three. I made a reservation a couple months in advance for my dan mans bday. i thought what could be better then this futuristic concept? but when i got there i was disapointed to see that the decor was not inviting or worthy of the near 500 dollar meal. the website made the place look SO cool and pretty. it was cold, sterile, uninviting, and drab. it kind of reminded me of the movie 1984. the atmosphere was so quiet and echo-y that it made me feel uncomfortable and it was kind of dark. if you are going to make food of the future that is expensive as hell make the decor light, vibrant, attractive, and inviting. make it feel like you are experiencing something amazing. the food was okay. i liked that they were vegetarian friendly. but the rush of all these little food entrees at erratic speeds probably did not make me appreciate it as much as i should have. i felt uncomfortable like dining should be relaxed and casual not highly synchronized like clockwork to where you feel rushed. i will give them props for the dessert. it was a frozen mousse that they laid a rubber mat on the table and decorated it with chocolate drizzle and then they cracked the frozen mousse on the mat. like the dessert was table art. i thought that was pretty cool. but if they lighten up the decor and give the service a more relaxed feel i think it might be worth all that money."
686,well worth it. fun and interesting bites. really is all about the experience. each dish was beautifully presented and tasty. wine pairing I could have skipped and saved some $$$ :)
687,Sublime experience. I was still hungry after the meal but this is food as art at it's finest!
688,"Exquisite food, theatrical experience. Amazing - and worth every cent!"
689,"Best. Meal. Ever. Dining at this place is an experience - it's amazing how the courses manage to appeal to all of your senses. They're just astounding, with cauliflower cooked and plated to look like trees, pillows of air that emit scent when the plate is set, little spheres of stuff that explode in your mouth. Everything was imaginative and revolutionary. Service was great - attentive but not pushy. One thing to note - budget a lot of time for this dinner. The 20-course meal took three hours!"
690,"I think most of it has been said. The food is creative to the point of being a bit ridiculous. I ate so many things that came with instructions of what to do, that I had to laugh. But the compositions are thoughtful. The tastes are almost uniformly pleasant. The wine pairings are spot-on. The service is casual yet professional. And the atmosphere is tasteful and mature, without being stuffy. Come here for a special occasion, though I would not call it ""romantic,"" as it's a bit too austere for that."
691,"FABULOUS. Very inventive menu with clever presentations using what often looked like executive office toys. We both left full after the 24 course tasting menu with wine pairings. That's a lot of courses, but it didn't feel like our meal took over 4 hours. After reading some other reviews, we both couldn't imagine needing anything additional to eat afterwards."
692,"Lots has already been said about this place so I'm not sure how much new light I can shed on the place. Except, after travelling around the U.S. for the past several months and eating at some terrific places (Blue Duck Tavern, Redd, Cochon, Zuni Cafe, Slanted Door, Luke for starters) not one tops Alinea. So much better than any Tom Keller place. Yes expensive, but you can be assured that you will have a truly amazing dining experience. The food: not everything works but so much does and your taste buds and brain never get tired of anything. It's like you are on a food adventure with the chef. I worried before going about the overhandling/preciousness/food science over just simple enjoyment of good food. But the chef's touch is just right--bringing out the best of each item you eat, finding impossibly wonderful combinations of flavors, textures, and temperatures. Most importantly, you trust the chef to deliver no matter what you are eating. The wine: amazing pairings! Wines I might never have tasted and each went absolutely seamlessly with the food. Service: outstanding. Don't judge a book by its cover--much of the wait staff look a tad scruffy with sloppy facial hair, haircuts, and ill fitting suits. But all were incredibly impressive. Amazing balance between being very professional but not off putting, knowledgeable (especially the sommelier) and warm while leaving you space to enjoy your meal. You feel appropriately watched over but also comfortable enjoying your experience. If you could only pick one place in the U.S. to have your most memorable meal, this would be THE place."
693,"Alinea was amazing. The food and service were spectacular. Our waiter had lots of interesting things to say about the dishes and seemed happy to answer our additional questions as well.I did the wine pairings and the 12 course meal. Each dish had it's own unique presentation, including one that was placed on some sort of lavender scented pillow that slowly deflated during the course. I was expecting that it would be great, but have to mention that I do not consider myself a huge foodie. I'd rather go to a good BYOB place and bring my own medium priced bottle of wine. That said, I think Alinea was worth every penny."
694,"I really can't say anything more than what's been said already. I've never had a dining experience like Alinea's. For each dish, my palette traveled to another plane of existence. Get ready to put forward a lot of dough for that trip, though. One tip: don't gorge on the food, eat it slowly. I have a tendency to shovel my food, so I had to curb that habit. You'll appreciate the food more."
695,"Truly the most unique and inspiring dining experiences I've had in Chicago, or the world for that matter! The service, food, decor were all top notch, though I have to say that the full touring menu with the wine pairing was a bit much, we were struggling by dish #20! Still fantastic though."
696,"Best restaurant in Chicago, hands down. This review is coming a year after I actually went with my girlfriend, and we still can't stop talking about it. Yes, it's pricey, but well worth the experience. Instead of having a sexy dinner somewhere and going to a show/sporting event/night of binge drinking after, you can spend the same amount on a night at Alinea for a perfect experience. The 12 course tasting with wine pairings left us very satisfied."
697,"I was a frequent diner at Trio when Grant was there, where I was a great fan of his innovation, execution, and playfulness. When Alinea first opened I was there the first week. While it was very impressive, it somehow did not rise to my soaring expectations. Of course it was the first week, and I would not hold it against them. Finally, years later, I had the chance to come back. I have no hesitation in saying that it was the BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE! The playfulness I remember from Trio has returned in full force, but is now mature, sophisticated, and complex. And the classic courses are not only perfectly executed, but they are so fresh and exciting that you feel as though you could be eating them for the first time in the early 20th century. If there is a restaurant that absolutely deserves your hard-earned dollars in this economy, THIS IS IT!!!!"
698,"Alinea was magical. I surprised my boyfriend by flying him to Chicago and treating him here for his 25th birthday, and we both agreed it was the best meal of our lives (and we've been to Charlie Trotter's, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Chez Panisse, etc.). Even though we ordered the 12-course tasting, we actually got a bunch of extras that brought our total to a very generous 18 courses each (plus a special chocolate birthday dessert for my boyfriend). Favorites were the black truffle explosion, hot potato cold potato and the melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu beef, which was accompanied by a gourd that billowed A-1-scented smoke (really!) onto our table while we ate. Even the little things, such as the goat's milk butter that was served with the selection of bread, were wonderful. One of the most special parts of the evening was when Grant Achatz himself came out and personally prepared a dessert at our table that was inspired by a Jackson Pollack painting. He basically threw ingredients - including blueberries, maple and chocolate mousse - into an artistic heap that we then ate directly off the table (it was covered with a special material). I was totally starstruck when Grant came out, but he was very nice and chatted with us while he prepared the dessert. The service at Alinea was outstanding - attentive without being overbearing, informative without coming off as pompous. The ambiance was also a nice surprise - I was worried it would be stuffy and quiet, but guests were clearly very comfortable and the restaurant had a nice formal-but-fun air to it. At the end of the meal, we were presented with beautiful customized menus that took into account the different dishes we had for some courses (my boyfriend doesn't eat pork) and listed our wine pairings (we got nine wines total) under the courses they were served with. My boyfriend's menu even came with a special birthday message, which was a nice touch. I've wanted to go to the French Laundry for years, but now I'm thinking it will be very difficult to top this experience. Chicago becomes an even better city with the presence of Alinea."
699,"This place is in another dimension. I highly recommend doing the full tour, which takes about 4 hours. Everything about Alinea is over the top, in a good way. I've eaten here twice (about a year apart) and each experience was equally as phenomenal. The food and its presentation are works of art. Service is beyond exceptional (you have a team of people really). Agree with other reviewers that if you are more of a ""Maggiano's"" type, you might not like this place. It is quite expensive. I took my husband there for his birthday and we did the full tour with partial wine and beer pairings and our bill with tip was about $800. If you go when they have the bacon donuts, consider yourself lucky. Once you eat here, pretty much every other high-end restaurant in the city will seem just ok. Highly highly recommended at least once."
700,Very VERY creative place. The food is great but could be less 'fizzy' Fabulous experience...overall..quite the entertainment :)
701,"A definite experience that must be had. The chef personally prepared the final course for us, and was a really nice down to Earth guy . Go for the full course and wine pairing, you will not regret it."
702,"Humor isn't often a component of fine dining. Nor do many of my dinners take on a kabuki theater like atmosphere. This is a must do. Outrageous. Suspend all disbelief , the wine parings made it."
703,"It's true. Alinea is truly spectacular. My friend and I partook in their longer tour menu which lasted 4 hours and there was never a dull moment. I won't go in depth with each course because other reviews have done so, but also because I believe that anticipation of each course adds to the experience. I didn't want to like Alinea because I thought it was overrated, but it was without a doubt worth every single penny and one of the best dining experiences of my life. There are theatrics to each course and requiring active participation makes you enjoy the meal that much more. I will also say that Chef Achatz is a genius who has put much thought and deliberation into every aspect of his restaurant from the menu to the restaurant name, the font, everything. He has created a new standard for what it really means to be a chef. Please go try Alinea because it's unlike anything you've ever had before and will create a new viewpoint on what culinary is."
704,Giving this place 6 stars if I could. It takes fine dining to a new level by adding elements of theatre and wild creativity. We went two years ago and had something that sounded ridiculous(18 courses?) but it was just right. You're in master hands here - just trust them. Everything was delicious and the experience of anticipating all the strange and beautiful courses transported us. Last year we weren't able to get a reservation so we went to Charlie Trotters and were horribly disappointed. We booked our reservation for October on August and it was already filling up(I think they'd just started taking Oct reservations on Aug 1?) Get organized and get in here - you'll be glad that you did!
705,"3 Michelin starred restaurant that transports you to somewhere you have never been before. A piece of advise, try to not look at the menu before hand as it might ruin a bit of the excitement."
706,"My wife and I really enjoyed the food at Alinea although we thought the service was a little robotic and the overall experience was a little bit flat. By way of reference my favorite high end restaurant is probably Jean Georges. Same for my wife. The building is nondescript and I dont think there is any signage other than the valet parking sign. Its just this black building. Even when I passed by the next day I only saw the address numerals on the building - no signage. The doorman came to the cab to get us. The hallway is wavy and bathed in a red light. We went down the hall and were greeted in a friendly manner. I looked to my side and through a clear door saw the kitchen. I think I saw Grant A. doing something. We decided to go with wine pairing and we also opted for the one special of the night - a risotto with brown butter and white truffles (extra $75 each). We declined the Riserva wine option - this would have been $250 each. Instead it was $160 which they tell you is approximately 3/4 of the price of the meal. The meal is $195 pp. Our wine Sommelier was great - this guy was a big poofy hairdo. He had a great personality and was very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed the 4th dish of Golden Trout Roe - a delicious dish. I love the texture of the roe and the flavor with coconut, licorice and pineapple was fantastic. She loved the 5th dish of yuba, shrimp, miso and togarashi - it's like a long, crunchy snack that tastes like shrimp and is coated in seeds with great flavor. The vessel it comes in has a dipping sauce hidden in a little chamber. Very tasty. I didnt care for the 6th dish of Chao Tom - sugar cane, shrmp, mint - you chew it for a bit and it reminded me of like what Id imagine it would be like to chew bamboo or some 'reedy' plant. It was OK. 7th - halibut, blk pepper, vanilla, lemon: fantastic, flavorful, light, delicious combination of flavors. 8th - a shot of apple, horseradish and celery - it's in a glass with this big, exploding sphere. Open wide, swallow and shut quickly - the sphere is large and then it pops. Nice palate cleanser I guess. 9th - Rabbit - parfait, rillette, consomme - you get this white piece of serviceware and it has three parts. The first part at the top is the parfait and then they remove that and inside is the rabbit rillette and then they remove that and its the soup. All delicious and I love rabbit and I love that you get to experience it with different textures and temperatures all in one experience. 10th - white truffle with parmesean, brown butter and truffle - so simple but so amazing. Perfectly cooked and made so much better with funky, delicious truffles. It was a few spoonfuls - worth $75? In a way, yes, but I wish it was just 2 or 3 spoonfuls more. Although I left Alinea full so I guess it is planned this way on purpose. 11th - Pheasant, green grape, shallot, burning leaf - the meat is on the end of a branch with leaves that smelled like they were likely burned. This very pleasant perfume accompanies this tender, flavorful bite of the meat. 12th - short rib, olive, red wine, blackberry - at the start of the meal, the staff drapes this orange thing that looks like a fruit rollup over two black things that look like chopsticks. They tell you this is for later. It's pasta - a ravioli sheet. They give you a board with the above ingredients and some others like black garlic and salt. You put it all into your ravioli. So delicious. 13th - hot potato cold potato, black truffle, butter - you get a little wax bowl with a pin in it that holds cold potato elements. You pull the pin from the bottom and it falls into the hot elements - quickly eat and savor the flavors. 14th - pigeonneau - apparently its a very old classic dish executed exactly. So just imagine a perfect flaky litttle tart crust with meat and cream and vegetable inside - small and wonderful. Light, not heavy - but rich tasting. 15th - black truffle explosion - you bite this package on the spoon and this wonderful flavor of truffle explodes in your mouth. the desserts of bacon, carmel popcorn, earl grey and chocolate were fantastic but I didnt care for the whole bubblegum ""suck out of the tube"" exeprience. Total damage with wine and tip and tax was around $1100. Despite the muted overall experience, the food, the sommelier and being with my wife made it worth it. Id most likely go back next time Im in town. However, I might skip the wine pairing as it was a bit too much for us. Not so much me, although I was pretty buzzed, but my wife had a head-ache next day"
707,"This place is what I call magic food. Overly expensive and while it's real good, you leave hungry. Maybe go once."
708,"The four of us flew to Chicago from California one weekend for the express purpose of dining at Alinea. We opted for the 23 course ""tour"" menu. Every element of the dining experience at this restaurant is carefully considered, even your first steps into the restaurant. When you enter the unmarked building, you step into a long disappearing corridor. There is an automatic sliding door which surprises you near the end of the corridor. The dcor is modern and minimalistic. There is no tablecloth on the table, but as you will find out, there are many, many pillows that will show up throughout the dinner. There are pillows for our bench seating. There are little pillows upon which to rest your clean utensils. There are even aromatic pillows that accompany a dish, releasing the fragrance of juniper as it slowly deflates sitting under the weight of the dish. Service is impeccable. At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to our every need. Our first course was a small, bite sized croquette. When one of my dining partners and I joked that we were going to be disappointed if we needed to go out for steak after dinner, a waiter came by a minute later offering us bread. When one of us started to fall behind in the 12 glass wine pairing, the sommelier started to pour less, and charged us proportionately less. The dishes I loved the most were dishes that paired together interesting and contrasting tastes but were not overly fussed with. For example, the first course called ""croquette"" was a small croquette with cream and a garnish of steelhead roe. I wasn't impressed with the idea of a croquette, but when you pop it into your mouth, the crunchy crust quickly gives way to an unexpectedly tender, creamy interior, shortly before the luscious oily roe pops over it all. A good start. Our second course was called ""octopus"" and consisted of a thin slice of octopus stacked with shiso flowers and papaya. A small bowl of broth made from soy beans accompanied it. The combination of flavors and textures was delicious, and the broth chaser complemented the octopus well. The dishes that I did not love, and even disliked, usually involved ingredients that were overly processed to the point where the attempt to extract the essence of the flavor resulted more often in ill tasting artificialness. It was like you were eating a purple grape flavored candy as opposed to a fresh grape. The worst dish representing this was a dish called ""short rib,"" which included Guinness beer, peanuts and fried broccoli. Now, I absolutely adore short ribs and beer, so how could anyone mess this up? Here's how. The chunk of short rib sat under a translucent, square thin gelatin sheet, presumably made of the Guinness. Bits of peanut and burned broccoli were scattered about the dish, along with mustard seeds. What I love about beer is that refreshing, hoppy, cool liquid taste sliding down your throat, perhaps cleansing away the fatty short ribs you just ate. Now take away the liquid, refreshing, tasty aspects of beer, and what you've got left is that gelatin sheet. The short rib lacked its usual rich, fatty, chewy texture and more resembled stewed meat. Even the mustard seeds and burned broccoli had a monotonous, bitter taste. Not all the dishes need to be great, but none of the dishes should be...bad. A disappointing surprise was that many of the dishes were over salted, killing whatever flavor was underneath. For example, in a dish called ""hot potato,"" the warmth of the hot potato released the mouth watering aroma of a black truffle slice and contrasted nicely with the chill of a cold cream potato soup, but the whole dish was marred by the extreme saltiness of the soup. At first, we thought this was a fluke, but several dishes had the same problem. On the plus side, all the meats, from the delicate seafood to the venison, were cooked perfectly. Also, careful attention was paid to the texture of each element in the dishes, a dimension I find is often ignored in many restaurants. Achatz' techniques show their strength in the desserts. Almost a third of the courses could be considered desserts, which is more than I would have liked, but they all had interesting combination of tastes that worked well with each other. I loved the bubble encapsulating sweet ginger liquid in one of the desserts, and I also loved the subtly flavored cube of shaved ice that contrasted with the creaminess of horchata pudding in another dessert. The wines we drank (One 12 glass wine pairing plus 2 bottles) were all good, though not remarkable. The sommelier hinted as much when he mentioned that the wine was selected to complement the food, not dominate it. Like the touristy dorks we are, we asked for Grant Achatz' autograph on our souvenir menu. He graciously complied for all four of us: ""Thank You, Grant."" Our total worked out to be $1200 before tip. You're welcome."
709,I was very impressed. Pricey as it is if you enjoy food and interesting and novel ways to prepare them you definitely have to try it once. It certainly lives up to its reputation!
710,"I think I'd better write a Yelp review on this baby even though I went there just over a year ago. Wow. Just, wow. From the non-descript exterior, to the minimalist art in the foyer, to the comfortable chairs, the atmosphere was just right. My friend and I decided that this would be the ultimate in our food adventurings. We were right. We tried the 12 course menu and each item was like a tiny work of art. My favorites included a carrot ravioli with a coconut powder filling served in a lobster consommee with lobster chunks and a lobster cracker and a tiny bison filet wrapped in potato strings and flash fried and served with a spice gel cube, pistachios and pistachio puree. Our server was friendly and informative. We went on a little tour of the restaurant after our meal, and then wandered dazed onto the dark sidewalk clutching our souvenir menus. An experience well worth every penny."
711,totally blows your mind !!!!!
712,"ate at Alinea last year, at one year anniversary. of course everything was great, sometimes even tasty. the whole science and food thing is weird to me, but Alinea is great for chicago and for that i will respectfully cast each of the available 5 stars. but i would rather eat at blackbird, trotter, or hot doug's."
713,"I can only give it 4 stars because there were 2 dishes (of the 26 they gave us) that I didn't eat because I didn't like them. ""Didn't like"" may be an understatement. I may have had my strongest reaction ever to a dish- at Alinea. Our 4th dish (after the first trio) was the salad course, and it was tomatoes in different forms, which was okay. But then there was the basil gelee (disgusting) and mozzarella foam puff (even more disgusting). I actually HATED it. And I've never had such a strong reaction to something before. I understand that Alinea is a different concept, but the food should still all be palatable. I did really like the chicken liver bite, and some of the deserts, but overall I wasn't super impressed like I thought I would be. I will say that the service was AMAZING and they all did a great job. A little irreverent at times, which is right up my alley. I don't know if I'll ever go back, but it was an interesting experience."
714,"This is the best meal I've ever had in my life. No kidding. And not by just a little. This is a special occasion place...it's pretty much as pricey as it gets. My wife and I had the 14 course option, and around five of them exceeded anything we've ever eaten before. They offer the 14 course ""tasting"" and a 24 course ""tour."" The tasting is three hours and the tour is around five. The food was amazing and beautiful, but that's to be expected at these prices. What blew us away was how many flavors and textures chef Grant Achatz was able to put in the more elaborate dishes (several were one-bite tastings...and complex in their own right). It was a nice balance of molecular gastronomy showoffiness and pure, solid, delicious food. This place deserves every bit of praise it's gotten (for example, #1 restaurant in the U.S. by Gourmet Magazine). Everything about it was perfect, and it's better than Thomas Keller's Per Se in NYC in my opinion."
715,"Wow! There are no words to accurately describing the dining experience at Alinea. Rated the best restaurant in the country by Gourmet magazine, I'd have to second that though. It was amazing. We ordered the full tour - 27 courses that wowed, dazzled, amazed and engaged multiple senses. The timing and flow of the courses was impeccable. I was constantly satiated, but never uncomfortably full. Dishes ranged from an Italian fava bean dish served on a pillow of lavendar air that slowly deflated over the course of the dish, to a hands-free dish, to ""Chinese take-out"". Words cannot describe how amazing this restaurant is, what a genius Achatz is, and how completely satisfying the experience is. For my full tour, one glass of wine (they kindly provided 2 half glasses), tax and tip, I walked away $327 poorer, but still think it was worth every single penny. The wine pairing seems nice, but at an additional $150-$175, didn't seem worth it... just for wine."
716,"Go with an open mind, empty stomach, and eagerness to turn yourself over to experience. Yes, iIt's slightly intimidating despite kind staff, but Do it! Most generous wine pairing I have ever experienced. Embrace the frivolity and the amazing tastes. Enjoy the surprise. Marvel in the new while referencing the past. No pressure to love every bit - it's not all equal per your palate or execution but it's better than 90% of anything else you'll ever enjoy."
717,"I recently had two friends in from the Sonoma/Napa area of California. They came to visit the city and specifically eat at Alinea. They asked that I attend with them as a treat for my birthday. Quite the treat indeed. First of all the couple had met the chef in the past and also new someone else connected to the restaurant.... which led us to having a special 27 course meal ....along with wine pairings. Needless to say, this was one of the most amazing dining experiences of my lifetime. 27 courses and 5 1/2 hours later our dinner was complete with a look of amazement on all of our faces. The food, the inventiveness, the service.... all outstanding. I agree with another yelper.... multiple foodgasms happened that night. I cannot recommend Alinea enough. My favorite courses: Monkfish done 3 ways. Wagyu beef (and I thought Kobe was amazing) with yuzu, seaweed smoke and sea grapes. Cheese in a cracker. Rhubarb done 6 ways. Hot potato, cold potato wit black truffle and butter. Foie Gras with spicy cinnamon, apple pate de fruit..... the list can go on and on. Plus an amazing combination of Italian, French and German wines that made me giddy. To top off the evening..... going into the kitchen to see the amazing staff of chefs and meeting head chef Grant. WOW on every level. Thanks again to my friends, I cannot thank you enough"
718,I am a foodie and regularly enjoy gastronomic and high end dining. I tried to make a simple reservation and was treated incredibly rudely. I am unable to get over just how ridiculous the process of scheduling a table was to try the restaurant.
719,"This was a highly anticipated meal for us. My aunt loves this place and I was excited that we got a reservation. First, I wanted to take a big party there, but the host who spoke to my wife was rude and belittling. He lectured her and just made her uncomfortable. We had a pretty tight schedule, so he informed us that how can we even consider eating there the same night we arrive in Chicago. You want to bring some children too, not at their place. This still didn't discourage us from eating here during the only free evening we had and without the kids. The food was good and the presentation was impressive. There are quite a few tricks that enhanced the eating experience. But just like foam and air, the first few times was impressive, but after a while, I think it just there without adding to the meal. I think it is a good place, but not was impressed. I wished they have a full bar also."
720,Alinea does it right from the minute you step in. Beautiful interior if not a little to quiet and formal. Definitely do the full tasting menu as the dishes are so avant guard that just the presentation is worth the price of admission. Hands down the best in chicago.
721,"Alinea is definitely the next most memorable dining experience next to Joel Rubochon in Las Vegas, which is saying a lot actually because Joel Rubochon is the shit. Anyway, my boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was perfect for the occasion. Alinea is definitely one of those places that the dining experience is so unique and overwhelming that it almost overshadows the food. Don't get my wrong though, the food is super unique, innovative and delicious but I think what really made it memorable was the intrigue of waiting for the next course (they like for their 10-course meal to be a surprise so you don't know what the next course is going to be) and acting like food critics (more like trying to figure out what we were eating) with my boyfriend as each course came along. You get a lot of courses (10 or 15 depending on which one you choose) and they come in small portions - each course is quite heavy though so I was pretty full 2/3 of the way through. Some courses were better than others but they were all consistently delicious. If you don't want to get the wine pairing option, you can order wines in smaller portions to sample and pair with the different courses. The servers were very professional - not exactly the type that makes you feel super comfortable - but they were knowledgeable and attentive. Unlike a lot of restaurants in Chicago, Alinea has a very roomy dining room. Tables were spaced out far apart from each other so conversation never clashed from table to table. The decor is modern but elegant, chic but not overly trendy. It wasn't anything super special but the vibe fit well with the food. At the end of dinner, they brought out 2 truffles and a cup of hot liquid chocolate - they poured the hot chocolate on the truffles to ""unwrap"" it, as a way to wish me a happy birthday. It was a nice touch. I'd highly recommend Alinea for an occasion or celebration - it's just not one of those restaurants you'd go regularly (not only because of how expensive it is, but the value-added of the whole experience would decrease exponentially if visits are overly frequent)."
722,"My husband and I are self-proclaimed ""foodies"" but this place takes food to a new level. We had the 12 course tasting menu along with the wine pairings (which if you are questioning...is definately worth it) The layers of flavors in each bite are so harmonious...favorites are duck with thai flavors, wagu beef and a black truffle ravioli. Desserts were good, but definately not the stars of the menu."
723,"Prior to dinning at Alinea I imagined that any miss in quality would be surpassed by the elegance of the remainder. I was wrong. In short: Alinea's quality to price ratio just doesn't stand up but it is still extremely intriguing. Fun: yes; interesting: yes; worth it:...sadly, no; would I go back: ...more upsetting, yes. Note: I indicate some dishes here but am purposefully vague on most as I feel it is best to go into Alinea blind. Before going further, know that I was slighted early on when, four courses in, the server forgot to serve me. Yes. That's correct. After serving the other members of our party, the server left the table. Having heard about the service, I couldn't believe the misstep and assumed he was retreating to bring my course. Everyone at my table (3 others in total) were aghast and finally caught the eye of the main host who served me the dregs of the dish that had served the rest. There was no apology or much indication at all. The only indication, was a shrug of ""it happens"" by the server. So, understand that a bias existed early on. We did the tour and there were huge successes. The course I was slighted on being a major one: a pork belly dish that I could eat daily for a year or life. Also two ""soups"", one of Duck with morels and foie gras, and another of green garbanzo and mint (served with a fork full of entirely passable octopus). The Black Truffle explosion was fantastic. However, there were some misses that seemed to be correlated with the presentation. One being a venison course served very elaborately. Another was the final course, a chocolate and menthol ""dish"" served table side by none other then chef Grant Achatz. The menthol was intriguing but the chocolate missed the mark. The texture seemed to be lost to the presentation. I was surprised to find courses at Alinea limited to and occasionally negatively affected by the presentation. Two more courses along this line were a sugar cane dish and a three part lobster dish. The former was simply forgettable. The latter started off incredibly but went into absurdly average with bits of lobster that would have been forgettable except for the fact that I remember not liking the taste, and ended with a bisque that was interesting but perhaps too briny (one of our party was a vegetarian and everyone agreed that her bisque was much better than ours). Since there was a vegetarian in our group I should mention that Alinea typically rises to the occasion. I tasted some of the vegetarian dishes and they played with the same ideas as the regular tour. In some cases they were a step above (bisque mentioned previously). However, there were big misses as well, such as the duck and foie gras soup that was done, for her, with mushrooms and left her very much wanting. Everyone did a wine pairing and I upgraded to the reserve pairing. The wines overall were superb, especially a Ripasso served late in the meal and an interesting white which had been pressed with the skins (Radikon Oslavje 2004). Of note is that a lot of the wines were a bit sweet to pair with the courses - overall the courses being served currently tend towards sweet. I was happy to have paid for the reserve pairing as the wines which I ""avoided"" were a bit more acidic then I would have liked. I was happy right until the last wine poured: a 1976 tawny port. I don't typically drink 30+ year old port but I have had 30 year old port and I have loved the intense complicated flavor that comes from an aged vintage port. This was not such a port. It tasted like sherry with a slightly nutty aftertaste if one works past the extremely overpowering taste of alcohol. I was shocked but I was also helping finish off other desert wines and found great joy in a late harvest zinfandel from Dashe. So I set the port aside and tried to forget it. In the end I couldn't and commented to the main host who had been accommodating and entertaining other than the pork belly fiasco. The response was a polite indication that I was simply wrong. I wasn't asking for anything. I had already paid. If I was looking for anything it was a discussion of why I thought the port was off towards alcohol from any other aged port I have had. But I got nothing in return. I still feel that I need to justify 3 out of 5 stars. It simply comes down to the quality to price ratio. Two comparable restaurants that I have eaten are Minibar in DC and Don Alfonso 1890 in Sorrento, Italy. I had no problems at Minibar and the food and wine never missed as much as at Alinea (not mention the cost). At Don Alfonso, a fly landed in my wine glass. It was not their fault at all but they quickly whisked away my wine glass and provided me with a free dessert wine to compensate the lost glass of wine. Compare these two experiences to Alinea where they forgot to serve me a dish and did nothing, poured a glass of port that I won't soon forget, and had misses that seemed to only benefit the presentation. But yes, sadly, I would try again."
724,"Totally amazing! We went for work. We did the 12 course tasting with wine. The staff was professional, attentive, polished. The food was outstanding!"
725,"Well my girl and I were in Chicago for the first time last year, around Thanksgiving seeing my brother. I had made reservations every night at different restaurants around Chicago, David Burkes Prime House, Gibsons, Ditkas, The Chophouse, Gene and Georgetta's. I missed this place but met a woman at The Peninsula who sells them their loose tea. She got us reservations the next day. We were only able to do the 12 course, however we went out with our smellier the next evening drinking and drinking some more. He got me another reservation the next evening for a 24 course that I took my mother to. She enjoyed it very much and was amazed. She does not drink so our Sommelier paired different flavored ciders and hot teas to accomodate her. Very Classy. Liquified carrot was a favorite. The frozen ball in orange water explodes in your mouth with an assortment of flavors I cannot begin to explain. Yes Expensive but definetly worth it."
726,"I mean, come on, of course this is going to get a 5 star rating. This place is unbelievable. I can not fault the service, food, or atmosphere - only my own lack of adventure when it came to a couple of plates...I just don't like lamb! Thankfully there were many many more dishes that more than satisfied my appetite and curiosity! I took my boyfriend for his birthday and we were amazed by the attention to detail each server provided. They were so precise with every movement we were initially a little on edge...did we belong here? My boyfriend made a comment about the white sauce on the plate only to realize it wasn't a sauce...it was the plate. The shiny, white, glistening plate that was clearly so perfect he mistook it for a sauce. I replied to the waiter that my bf wasn't used to seeing plates so clean and that immediately broke the ice...they liked us - they really liked us! The service was impeccable - down to a piece of bread which had somehow fallen from my plate to the table but was so unworthy of a hand to pick it up they came back with utensils to scoop it up and take it away! The first dish, by far one of my favorites, was the ""hot potato cold potato"" which has been spoken of in many other reviews. One single sip of soup with a tiny potato speared at the head of a pin along with a single piece of chive, butter, and cheese. So tiny but so delicious...a great start to a beautiful meal. This dish was in Chicago magazine (if I remember correctly) and became the reason I had to come! We are so grateful that Grant has recovered and survived his bout with cancer therefor giving us a chance to sit amazed and in awe of his talent over a 3 hour meal which we will NEVER forget. When we finally walked out onto the street I felt like I had been on vacation. It was a surreal experience with a lasting impression that I had become a tiny part of Willy Wonkas fantasy land."
727,Grant Achatz = Genius
728,"I refuse to start this review with Alinea is an ""experience"" because this is a cliche. In any case, a better description of Alinea is an ""achievement"" - this restaurant has succeeded in making dinner a singular event. As you would expect from a restaurant that has been named #1 in North America and #7 in the world, the food is beyond description (at least mine). Ingredients, preparation, presentation and, most importantly, taste are all marvels. The service is exemplary -- it seemed as though a small army was at our disposal throughout the night. That being said, I have dined at other restaurants that excel in these areas as well. What pushes Alinea further yet is its attention to detail. From the creation of many of its own intricate eating utensils to the number of special options available (reserve wine flights and truffles shaved table-side), to having our car waiting out in front as we exited, Alinea is as close to perfection as a restaurant can realistically hope to get. As you might expect, you pay for the privilege of dining there (the bill for two was four figures). For most, choosing Alinea will come down to a number of ""ifs"" - if your palette is up to the adventure, if you can afford it, and if you can appreciate the little things that put it in rarefied air, find your way to this experience (damn, used that word after all)."
729,"I went to Alinea almost two years ago and I wasn't a yelper back then so I'm writing this a little late. The space is very high tech and simple. As you walk through the entrance hallway you aren't sure where to go... then a door on your left magically slides open (very inspector gadget!). We did the tour menu with wine pairings. It was the single most delicious, impressive, amusing... (I could go on and on) meal of my life. Every dish was outrageously creative and tasty. Just when I thought things couldn't get any better they placed a lavender infused pillow in front of each of us. They gave us a minute to take in the lavender scent. Then they brought our plates and put them on top of the pillow, as they did this the lavender air slowly seeped out and the pillows deflated. The dish was some sort of rhubarb, goats milk and onion concoction. OUTSTANDING! Bravo to chef Achatz, he has serious talent and creativity. I'm so excited he is opening another (more reasonably priced) place, Aviary. I live in New York now, but can't wait to check out Aviary next time I visit Chicago. Hoping Chef Achatz will open a place in New York eventually =)"
730,"Wonderful experience. Food is unique and I am a big eater and after the 12 course tasting I was plentifully full. If you have the money to spend and you really appreciate culinary expertise at its best, Alinea will be a wonderful experience. Wine pairings are a must even if you aren't big on wine. You get a buzz while eating good food, and the wines are excellent- especially the desert wines. The meal goes by slowly but each dish is presented by the wait staff who explain questions thoroughly. Overall A++ performance and wonderful birthday dinner. Hot Potato, Cold Potato- those who have been already know what I mean... Those who haven't should go to find out!!!"
731,"Great restaurant. Many of the dishes I had were amazing and will never forget. I would have given the place 5 stars, but one of the dishes was disgusting and hardly edible, and sadly I will never forget that one, either."
732,it is what they say it is. edible art
733,Everything very good. I just wish they didn't serve Pine Icecream for the grand finale.
734,"Out of 12 courses there are going to be highs and lows. But the unfortunately I dont remember any of the highs. There was nothing memorable about the food. The presentation was excellent and I highly recommend the wine pairing, where they present a story with each of the wines. However, the food was average and the sequence of the food seemed off. The best dessert course was artistic...yet they had 2 more dessert courses afterwards that were not merely as impressive artistically and were borderline disgusting."
735,Dined twice (tours only for this guy). Floored both times. Perfect in pretty much every way.
736,Everything about this place has been said before and more. I am not sure it deserves all the hype for the price but it was an incredible experience.
737,do I really need to write anything? speaks for itself
738,"To quote Tina Turner, Alinea is ""simply the best."" Take someone you love and go experience it for yourselves."
739,"Alinea was brillant and all of their courses were surprising and delicious. What an experience! We got to meet the incredible Chec Grant and I was star stuck. None of the food disappointed at all. I did deduct a star and would like to explain why... My father treated me to an evening at Alinea and we splurged and had the RESERVE wine pairings as well which is the same price as the tasting. Basically, dinner was $900 for two people. The pairings were mediocre, the food is so complex that I understand the difficulty in pairing...the issue I had was my favorite wine came near the end and it was a Spanish red. After desert, I wanted another glass. (let me back track, at the beginning our server/sommelier stated that with the pairings they will pour as your drink....) Anyways, I asked our server for another glass of the Spanish that I liked. He brought me a very small pour. At the end of the evening, the bill came and they charged us $12 for the pour. I asked about it and the server stated that because it was a reserve wine they charge for extra OUNCES!!!! At $450 a person I would think that an extra pour wouldn't cost $12. It is the principle of the issue and not the actual cost. This alone would probably lead me to NOT return. James Beard for food but not service"
740,AMAZING. Not much more to say that hasn't already been said...
741,alinea will change your life.
742,"My husband and I finally treated ourselves to Alinea last night and I really enjoyed the ""experience."" I was never much of a foodie, but lately I've realized that you're not really living a ""life"" unless you're up for new and eye-opening experiences. We've gotten a lot more adventurous with our culinary palates and if you have the money, it will be well spent here. We did the ""tasting menu"" and paired it with 3 different glasses of wine (white, red, and dessert wine) based upon the suggestions of the sommelier. I was impressed with the presentation and combination of flavors in all of the dishes. Some dishes definitely tasted better than others, but I appreciated the attention and detail that was required of all of them. The service was impeccable, but I was disappointed with the ambiance. It's a small bright dining room with 5 tables all right next to each other. It felt very industrial. I was looking for something a little more mellow and intimate. Otherwise, my palate was pleased and I'll remember this dinner for years to come. Be prepared to be amazed!"
743,"My fiance and I had talked about going to Alinea before, but we kept changing our minds, wondering if it was really worth the price tag. We had some friends come in town from San Francisco and they were interested in going, so we thought we'd splurge as a special occasion to catch up with them. We were not disappointed! I was a little disappointed that we could only get a reservation for 6PM for our group because that seemed so early for dinner, but we did not leave until 10:30! It was an all night experience. We had the Tasting with the wine pairings. One of our group did not enjoy wine, but they were very accommodating and willing to do a pairing of other beverages for them to enjoy. We were a little nervous about only having the Tasting and not the Tour - thinking we would be hungry still at the end of the meal - but none of us were, including the guys! Not only was the size of what we ordered a concern for me, but I also opted for my meal to be vegetarian and I wasn't sure if anything would be lost in the experience - it most definitely was not! In fact, some of my dishes looked better than the meat eaters dishes! They were creative though and many of the dishes looked exactly the same with creative changes made. Some dishes were more successful than others, but we really appreciated the creativity and presentation of each course. We also enjoyed hearing about all our pairings with the wine. The staff was so helpful and FUN. Maybe it is because we were the youngest group in the restaurant, but they were not the least bit stuffy and they definitely had fun with us. I like the added touch of getting a copy of your menu at the end of the meal. It is great to remember what we had and as a little souvenir of your special evening. If I had any complaint it was about the book! I knew there was a book available, and I thought it would be a great gift for our friends and for my fiance. Online it said you could order and the Achatz would sign it... when I tried to order online I had no luck, so I called the restaurant. They told me the only way I could have the book signed was if I bought it when I was at dinner. I told them we had only just recently been to dinner there and asked if I could order the signed copy and pay for the shipping and they refused. I thought that was pretty ridiculous! You offer to sell the book online and don't have it set up, but when I offer to pay for shipping after dropping $1500 on a dinner you won't even allow me to pay for the shipping of a copy of the book? That left a bad taste in my mouth, but I ultimately ordered the books on Amazon for less $ and free shipping.... but no autograph :o("
744,It simply doesn't get any better.
745,"I have one word. Spectacular. Really. Worth the money, lives up to the hype. Grant Achatz is a rock star, as far as I'm concerned. I found the cuisine inspired, the menu innovative and filled with humor, the flavors bright and complex, and the sensory experience delightful on all accounts. The staff were warm and unpretentious. I won't regale you with details of my 28-course Tour, but suffice it to say, this was the most magnificent culinary experience I have ever had...in any country. I will certainly be taking a pilgrimage to El Bulli in San Sebastian before it closes in 2012, if only to experience for myself the place from which Chef Achatz has sprung. I dined at Alinea as part of my culinary tour of Chicago - it put Charlie Trotter's to shame. I will definitely visit again during a different season. GO!"
746,"One of the absolute best meals of my life! I loved the decor, the glassware (including the depression-era glasses one wine came in!), the staff were *excellent*. My friend and I even got to go into the kitchen to watch Achatz (from afar) work! Every dish left me wanting more. I forgot to take a photo of one of my desserts, which the waiter asked Achatz if it was okay to bring me a second one, which he happily obliged. The staff makes sure that you have an incredible dining experience, and I was not disappointed! I would fly out to Chicago again just to go here!"
747,"My first meal at Alinea was the most amazing meal I've had in my life (and I don't exaggerate). I did the tasting menu two years ago, the massive tour menu last year, and last month with the single 20-course option they have on the menu. I was not quite as impressed with my last dining experience as the first two - I got the impression that the restaurant is now focusing more on efficiency, and trying to increase its throughput of customers per night to generate more revenue (just my opinion). Regardless, the food is still awesome, as well as the service and presentation. It is definitely a must-do if you have the disposable income and the time, and I look forward to coming back again in the future!"
748,"(btw - waiters are not rude - over the course of 4 hours we saw them go from professional and attentive to telling us stories of customers licking the table cloth for the dessert on the table! they have a great sense of humor and dry wit - they are prob used to seeing stuffy / uptight customers so if you are real with them, they are real with you!)"
749,"We ate here a few months ago and it was by far the best dinner we've ever had. Though unbelievably expensive for one meal, it was worth it. Truly a destination worth visiting and experiencing. If you go, get the 24 course. For two people, we found that with one of us ordering wine / sharing a glass, the amount of wine was just right (though my girlfriend and I are not big drinkers). The highlights were the hot/cold potato, black ruffle explosion, and cauliflower soup. There was only one dud--a butter themed dish that was way too rich/buttery, bordering inedible. Everything else ranged between very good to ""this is the best thing I've ever tasted."" Service was flawless. Very innovative, outside-the-box cooking; the best part about Alinea is that the extensive detail and culinary technique that goes into the dishes are designed partly to make you think about an experience food in a unique way, but more so to create flavors that are astonishing. I can't say the same of Moto, which was high on concept/creativity and somewhat absorbed with interest in novelty/technique/playing with food (e.g., all of the liquid nitrogen), but did not deliver flavors within the same league as Alinea (not even close). If you were thinking about going to just one molecular gastronomy restaurant between Moto and Alinea, I'd recommend Alinea over Moto in a heartbeat."
750,"ok so not to follow everyone else but... WOW... wine list priced reasonably??? at this place?? no way!!! food, service, atmosphere... i mean, really?!?!?! don't go there if money is an issue, go there for an experience you won't forget... will be back... times like that are few are far b/w for a foodie."
751,"I have eaten at many great restaurants, but none come close to Alinea. From the minute you step in to the violet glowing hallway you know you it's going to be a wild ride. And that it was. There are enough reviews here so I will not bore you with the details, however, the food and the amazing presentation of it all was unbelievable. I felt like a kid at Disneyland, anticipating each course to see what surprise it would bring. Now ,let's be clear if the food was not spot on, any show in the world would not impress me. The success of Alinea is that the chef pulls off the most delicious mouth explosions that are works of art. One more thing, the restaurant""s acoustics are a welcome change from all the super loud places that seem to be the rage. It was a pleasure to be able to hear everyone at our table. Our head waiter was very nice , and very knowledgeable. We had the 12 course with wine pairing. Worth every penny."
752,best meal ever- and a damn attractive kitchen staff!
753,Alinea is a great restaurant. It is expensive because it takes a lot of people's effort to make a single course. They even have to hand wash many of those dishes. I think price is justified in that sense. It was like attending a performance at a theater where each course has a part in telling a story. The first course prepares you for what to come and each course after is related to one another and help each other out to bring the best out of each course. I've enjoyed this aspect of dining here. Each course just disappeared in front of us as soon as they brought it. I screamed for every course. I hope I wasn't too noisy. From a course so delicate to a course so explosive it was like a great concert. The wine pairing was exceptional for the price we've paid. It is amazing what people can do to express and enjoy life. Maybe Grant's this passion for bringing life into his food help him get through the hard time when he had a very serious cancer. I can truly sense that when I was there enjoying his well prepared food. I really appreciate all the staffs at Alinea for working so hard.
754,"UMMMMMM YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA this is the best joint on earth! Hot Doug's is worth living for.They have every kind of hot dog, including game and snake!!!!!! In addition to his online menu, he has a daily special menu. His Chicago dog is better than any stand in town! I was in Chicago and insisted after wahtching this place on the food channel that I go! I have never been this blown away by food in my life. I dragged my wife and sister in law here. We ordered $75 worth of dogs and we each had to taste them all! Doug is a true genious. My hat goes off to this man. I tell all of my friends that visit Chicago that this place is a MUST! If there is a line, don't trip. It is worth it!!!!! Enjoy."
755,"I'm not sure what to say that hasn't been said... Expect to wait, expect that you will get some amazing, unique dogs, that are tasty and well priced and need to be rolled out. While we were waiting I was so skeptical we wouldn't get a table once we got in there, but they have a system, wait in the line, as you get close, don't take a table till after you order, and then you find a seat and your dogs are fresh and tasty."
756,"A unique experience.... Went here recently after reading a yelp friends review along with the fact that my girlfriend really wanted to go here. The wait wasn't bad, about 25-30 minutes. Now i had the pleasure of trying a few sausages there. The sal tessio and the keira knightly (fire dog i believe) was great, the elvis was good (although had with chili/beans, and cheese and the beans mess it up to me), didn't like the andouille sausage. Now for the duck fat fries, they were ok not great, as a matter of fact, i think the regular cheese fries are better. Only thing i would say is that you gotta have peppers (among at least 4 toppings i think are missing from here) for sausages and i think that 4 is a little bit early to be closing (but hey maybe thats what make this place great: it's own rules)."
757,"First of all, just make peace with the fact that you're going to be standing in line for a spell. A small price to pay for what waits inside. In my many years patronizing this establishment, Doug has never failed to welcome each customer at the register with warmth and humor. This is a man who clearly loves what he does! I couldn't begin to pick a favorite menu item. If I've ever not enjoyed something, it's because I took a leap and tried something outside of my comfort zone, NEVER because of the way the food is prepared. Hot Doug's is A+ in that area as well, every single time. Easily a top 5 eatery of Chicago and one I love treating out-of-town family members and friends to."
758,"Ok, so I am going to state up front that I am a hot dog fan. I have a tough time passing up any hot dog joint. So i was somewhat looking forward to a trip my fianc planned to Chicago. I've never been, but a trip from Los Gatos to Chicago for the Labor Day weekend brought to mind visions of deep dish pizza and...epic hot dogs. So I'm not going to pretend I have never heard of this place, although the guys in front of us in line were there randomly without a clue on the place. I have seen the Travel Channel shows and Food Channel expos and read the guide books. We encountered our first problem when my fianc let me know that Hot Doug's is closed on Sundays, also closed for Labor Day Monday, the following Tuesday and Wednesday. Oh, and they close at 4:00 PM. My problem...we landed at 1:45 PM on Saturday and left on Tuesday night. That meant we had a 2 hour window to hit Hot Doug's. Problem solved by taking a taxi directly from the airport to the restaurant. Do not pass go, do not go to hotel. Baggage and all. When we got here I knew we would be expecting a wait. A friend had prepared me for a 2 hour line. Got lucky. We arrived at 2:00 PM and we only had a 1 hour line on a Saturday. Felt great with that. DO NOT think it is going to be a quick trip. You will wait. Finally got in at 3:00 and already had my order planned out. First and foremost was the Foie Gras Dog. I thought I may have over-hyped the idea of this hot dog beyond it's ability to deliver. SO WRONG! Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. I should have ordered 3. The $10 price is WAY worth it. Next dog I went with was Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce, Caramelized Onions and Carrigaline Smoked Farmhouse Cheese. I had high hope for this. $8 per dog and sounds amazing. Anything with caramelized onions gets my buy. Wasn't quite as flavorful as the Foie Dog, but I feel like I should have eaten it first to avoid comparison. It was still delicious. Don't take this paragraph as a negative. Also got a ""The Dog"". ""Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the trimmings: 'nuff said"". At $2.00 it's one of the best buys on the menu. I was looking forward to this one almost as much as the Foie Dog. If you're going to go to Chicago, you'd better get a Chicago style dog. All the fixings...no exceptions. It was delicious. I mean good. They give you the option of a grilled or steamed bun. I went steamed. Can't argue for the grilled, but I like the ""squishy"" bun. Never had the neon green relish before...need to find a place to buy it in CA. Now to the fianc's order. Her first choice was a bison special. Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Bison Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Mustard Seed Gouda Cheese. Very cheesy and over the top flavor. Amazing dog. $8.00 Then she got a little old school and went with a Corn Dog. It's a dog deep fried in batter. If you don't like that...there's no hope for you. Also, it's $1.50. Win, win. Last but certainly not least. Not even second...the Duck Fat Fries. They are unreal. Rich and flavorful. Anything deep fried in duck fat should be as good as these. $3.50. Huge basket, but only Friday and Saturday. Ok, this is the longest review I've ever written, but I felt each item needed a touch so you know that you HAVE to hit this place. No question, if you are in Chicago, this should be the first place you send your taxi. Do not pass go, do not go to hotel!"
759,"Although I no longer live in Chicago, in fact, pretty much I live in the furthest state from Hot Doug's, those dogs keep calling me back. I revisited Hot Doug's back in March of 2012, this long-overdue re-review is the result of hearing the call once again. For almost six months, my last visit quelled the beast that is ""tummy de Grant"". Every Hot Doug's adventure results in the same fantastic experience. Whether it is the dead of winter, sweltering heat of summer or anytime in between, the line is long. Forty five-minutes to an hour and a half, long. For most, this excruciatingly cold, hot, mild wait for ""hot dogs"" is unacceptable. For those who've ""seen the light"", this momentary sacrifice is a necessary evil that is eclipsed by good. Courtesy of Yelper Lindley E., I am reminded of the beginning of every journey. Greeted by the ever-cheerful Doug, you're on the button to order to your hearts content. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Always take time to exchange pleasantries and inquire to his general well-being, he feeds hundreds of people daily, thousands weekly. Getting to know the man behind the counter in the precious minutes afforded, is magical. You know you're loved when someone introduces you to Hot Doug's. The nostalgia, the memories, the dogs, the tots, all marinate into your memory forever. Pro tip, you can order tater tots deep fried in the sausage fryer. No need to buy fries anymore, only tots. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Snag a table, sit down with your dogs, your tots, your green rivers, and your friends. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Thanks for the memories, Doug, I hope I never get Alzheimer's so I never forget."
760,"This is not a ""let's grab a quick bite to eat"" kind of place. It's equivalent to waiting in a long line for an amusement park rollercoaster ride... but for hot dogs... in a fast food setting kind of place. Ironic, you say? Yes, I say. If you plan on dining here, please don't arrive starving or hung over, and make sure to check your bloodsugar if you're a diabetic or else you WILL break out in a cold sweat, feel dizzy, and possibly pass out. That's not something you'd want to disclose to the paramedics when they have to carry your limp body to the ambulance, and all you have to say for yourself is ""I just wanted a hot dog"". Although, if you really NEED to have a hotdog here, arrive to this place well prepared. Perhaps bring a sleeping bag/folding chair, and camp out in front the night before, because the early birds get the hot dogs and duck fat fries. Maybe stand in line with a beverage, a book, your ipod, knitting supplies, or practice the art of meditating or staring blankly into space for long periods of time. Don't plan any dental appointments or things of the sort, and be prepared to answer the question to ""what did you do today"" with ""I waited in line for hours for a hot dog"". If you don't prepare yourself in this somewhat of fashion, you will become grumpy and the grumpiness will take away from the experience of what you just ordered. The hotdog will taste like any old hot dog and the fries will have just as well come from McDonalds."
761,"I just want to reiterate everything Kristine said in her review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ I went on a completely different day and had the same experience. Come prepared, and avoid the mental breakdown. If you succumb they win. Also, beware wandering desert man symptoms, or else you will be so thirsty you will want ten hot dogs to quench your parched stomach."
762,"It's yuppie food. It's good food. I had the foie gras dog and had some fries--it was good: nothing spectacular and beyond average but for the price, it's decent. It's nearly always packed but the food is worth it (at least for a one-time experience)."
763,"I went to Hot Doug's for the very first time yesterday. I had read all the reviews on here & how the line can be long & to be prepared to wait. So I had a plan. Coming from Michigan we would leave home by 7 AM. - therefore arriving at Hot Doug's by 9:30 AM. Well before the 10:30 opening time & we'd be FIRST in line!!! (Michigan is an hour ahead of Chicago, so that worked in our favor.) And that is EXACTLY how it worked - at least in my head. IN REALITY, of course we left Michigan quite late - and didn't arrive at Hot Doug's until about 12:15 Chicago time. And of course there was a line - lunch time on a Saturday at midday. For us it was about 1 hour 15 minutes. But honestly, the line went quickly. It did not feel like that long at all! We got inside and Doug took our order - chatting us up & was very funny. One hot dog I ordered was a Chicago Dog. Doug asked if I wanted that ""steamed"" or something else (I can't remember the other option now.) I asked him what is the traditional way? He said ""dry & mediocre"" - I busted out laughing. He informed me the better way to phrase that is ""what is the best way to have it prepared."" Soooo funny!! (I got it steamed - at least I think - I was still laughing :) CHICAGO DOG = soooo incredibly yummy. I could eat one of these every visit. I also ordered the Foie Gras dog. I was excited about this one. It sounds so interesting and I love trying new things. But, I have to admit I'm on the fence about this one. I'd say I'm about 80% like it - 20% - not quite sure what I think. Would I order it again? Yes. Would I order it EVERY day (or even once a week?) Probably not. But It was still very tasty - I'm glad I tried it. FOIE GRAS DOG = Glad I tried and overall liked - but probably not my favorite. My friend ordered the Sal Tessio. O.M.G. TRY THIS. It was so delicious. But then I'm a huge fan of spicy mustard. LOVED IT. SAL TESSIO = Doug needs to come to my house & make this for me many times. We also ordered duck fat fries. Honestly, I didn't think all that much of them. They were fine, but that was about the extent of my thought on them. My friend ended up eating most of them. Again - glad I tried them, but for me I would rather save room in my stomach to try yet another Hot Dog/Sausage. DUCK FAT FRIES - not for me. GOOD. just not for me. I am very glad we went. Yes there was a wait, but it seemed to go by quickly. The food was fantastic. It was fun to try new things, and Doug was hilarious. (And the service staff was fantastic as well! can't forget to mention them!) I definitely plan to go back - as often as I can. I can't wait to try rattlesnake someday."
764,"What can you say about this place that hasn't already been said? This is one of those places where it is worth it to wait in line for 2 hours. I have been to Hot Doug's 5-7 times as I am right in the neighborhood. If you are a first timer definitely try the foie gras, but you probably only need half so try to split it with someone else. In fact try to order as many sausages as you can handle and split them up because who knows when the next time you can wait in line for that long so pack it in and try as much as you can. Try the duck fat fries if your there on Fri-Sat, but again split them as they can serve 2-4 people per order. Every item i have ever had here lives up to the hype. I did have a kangaroo sausage one time and the texture was kind of funny. When you finally get to the front of the line, there is Doug ready to take your order, who is a super friendly guy so don't worry about rushing the order. There are somehow always seats inside. Not sure how they figured out the table turnaround, but it works. Stay strong and don't leave the line!"
765,"arrive at 10:30 sharp and people were standing outside already. so what's up with this place? got the original chicago hot dog-the dog with everything + sauerkraut and peppers comes in a poppyseed hot dog bun with a juicy, plump grilled sausage. there was a pop to each bite of the firm sausage. bread was so soft it was ripping from the bottom. love the pickles, tomatoes and veggies on top. it was a good sausage, but will I really wait in line for hours for it.....probably not."
766,"Oh. Em. Gee. I'm not a hot dog person, but these gourmet hot dogs are to die for! Right after breakfast, on our last day in Chicago, we took a 20 minute cab ride to Hot Doug's, got our dogs, took a 20 minute cab ride back to the hotel, 45 min ride to the airport... and then we finally got to take a bite. Was it worth all that trouble and wait? YES. Was it still good cold? YES. 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel: hands down the best one and worth $10! 2) Chardonnay and jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with fig cream and dutch meadowkaas cheese: sweeter than expected but good 3) Regular chicago dog: I hate to admit that I like it better than NY dogs. I love the poppu seed bun and all the extra toppings that come on it 4) Spicy Thai Chicken sausage with sriracha mustards, seasame-seaweed salad and duck cracklins 5) Wild rice and asiago cheese bison sausage with bacon-garlic mayonnaise, and mustard seed gouda cheese - didn't get to try the last two but I was told they were delicious Cash only. Duck fat fries only on Friday and Saturday. Do yourself a favor and try Hot Doug's."
767,"8/3/12 - It took me an hour to walk to this place from the train station, probably because I got a little lost along the way. Then it took another 1 1/2 hours (came literally 10-15 minutes after it had opened) while waiting on line in the blazing 90 weather in order to get my food. In fact, there was a worker who came out and said, ""We are glad that you guys came all the way here for our food, but the fact is that you will be waiting on this line for around 2 hours. We recommend going to another place to eat. We will always be here. If you do decide to stay on the line, please be sure to stay hydrated. We are very good friends with this man here (points to the man in the ice cream truck). He will take very good care of you. If you do get sick, do not come in to use the restroom. I am lazy and do not want to clean up after you. Again, we are glad that you came and be safe."" I have no idea how I remember all of that... But try to imagine my excitement when the couple in front of me left. It didn't make much of a difference, but that was 5 min. closer for me to getting my hot dogs and fries. When I finally got to the counter, I ordered the foie gras, Chicago, thuringer, and provolone chicken with duck confit hot dogs along with duck fat fries. All I can say is: please, please, PLEASE open up a shop in New York! The hot dogs in general were so juicy and, not to mention, huge. The foie gras hot dog was so rich and delicious. The Chicago dog was definitely better than Portillo's. The thuringer (garlicky) and provolone chicken (pretty spicy) were okay. But the duck fat fries - oh the duck fat fries! - were amazing (only available Fridays and Saturdays)! It was fatty and crisp. There was a man behind me who came and waited in the long line only for these fries! I was stuffing myself so much so that the couple who I was sharing a table with had asked my boyfriend as to where I had room to put it all in. So question has it: was the wait worth it? A resounding yes!"
768,"I stood in line for an hour.I got the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce, Caramelized Onions and Carrigaline Smoked Farmhouse Cheese $8.00 hold the onions.And the DUCK FAT FRIES ..... $3.50. That's a total of 11.50$. The hour i can never get back not kool.The ribeye which taste like an italian sausage was just ok.The duck fries taste burnt i was to far to take them back. No i will not be back."
769,"I'm sure this place has absolutely amazing food....if it were open. We walked a half hour to get here to find a sign saying it is closed for a week ""for no reason"" other than the fact ""there is no holiday in August."" You can't be featured by Anthony Bourdain and just shut down for a whole WEEK, and then brag about that reasoning on the door. Several other people walked up while we were standing there, with the same reaction. We all left angry and hungry. EDIT: I was just sent this message by Bryan Q, ""When I see Doug next, I'll tell him that he should never take a vacation. He should work every day of his life so as not to upset tourists. Funny."" In response, how would you like me to edit my review to be more fair? I'm sorry, I'm not saying nobody needs a day off, or that successful entrepreneurs can never take a vacation. He should have a days off like everyone else. I respect him for giving ALL of his workers Sundays off! If he wanted to give them Mondays too, more power to them. I don't care that Doug himself or his workers take a week off, that's not what I was going for; he just has to have enough hired help to cover his business. The restaurant business is not known for being able to drop off the face of the earth for a week at a time; keeping a fair schedule is part of being in the industry, especially for a restaurant that has been featured on the Travel Channel and regarded as Chicago's best and exists as more than a neighborhood favorite. Please tell me, am I wrong? I can't think of too many industries, such as restaurant and retail, who get to just take a week off without making customers mad. And, I think others had a right to know in case they ended up trying to go there in those eight days.... it wasn't like we just picked one bad day, we wouldn't have made it the whole time we were in town. I know things come up. I would have been sympathetic with a needed DAY or two or even three off (not eight), or a reasonable excuse (""My son is getting married on the East Coast"", ""my grandma is in the hospital"", ""my wife is in labor!"", etc.) ... Or, take a couple days off around one of the the other holidays in the other eleven months! Take four days off for labor day, nobody will question that. OR, if you must take eight days, less is more: let us wonder if someone died or your kid is going to college or if you've got the plague. For example, ""We apologize, we are closed and will reopen on August 15th."" The sign was not cute; it was a huge slap in the face when we'd been looking forward to it for so long. Doug, please let us give you the benefit of the doubt!"
770,"My feelings leading up to Hot Doug's: Day Prior: Really, Hot Doug's is supposed to be that good. I've had sausages in LA and they all taste the same. It can't be that special! 10:00 AM: Can't believe we are going this early for sausages. Why am I doing this again? 11:00 AM (!!!!!) - The restaurant is already packed with a line pretty much out the door!!!! Ummm, is Hot Doug's really that good? 11:30 - Well it does smell delicious, but I can't wait to take my first bite and just think about the bad review I will write. 11:31 (First bite)- WOW! (Repeat every 30 seconds) If you didn't get it from above, let me tell you here: Hot Doug's is by far the best sausage!!!!! We ordered the Kangaroo Sausage (with yellow pepper aioli and feta cheese) and the Philly Cheesesteak (cream cheese mustard, onions, and provolone cheese)! Hot Doug's does such an amazing job designing their sausage sandwiches! They take flavor, color, and texture all into play to create the most delicious sausage combinations. They must have a flavor laboratory that they do research in! You can actually taste the gaminess of the Kangaroo. The provolone cheese is actually stuffed into the Philly Cheesesteak sausage casing. All the flavors were synced in perfect harmony and I could not ask for more. Unfortunately, this was only stop 3 out of 10 of a full day's worth of eating in Chicago, so we could only try 2 sausages. You can come here daily and still not have tried all the sausages they offer. I need to stop now before I spontaneously book a flight to Chicago just for Hot Doug's. Doug - You are such an amazingly, fantastic and phenomenal human being! And I would just like to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. PS. Cash only"
771,"One of my favorite spots in Chicago! I have been there at least 7 times and it seems to get better each time. On my first visit I I waited in the line for two hours and it was worth every minute (if the line wraps around to the alley/dumpsters expect about a two hour wait). In fact, after the first hour I said to my roommate, ""This wait better be worth it..."" After another hour in line and then eating our meal, I felt bad for even questioning it. But don't worry, the line isn't always that long. If you can go on a weekday before the lunch rush, the wait can be a matter of minutes. Make sure to try a specialty sausage. If I am with a friend we usually each order a different one and then split them. The regular dogs and the ""fire dog"" are always great as well. If you go on Friday and Saturday and fail to order the duck fat fries, there might just be something loose in your brain. If you think that pork fat tastes good (think bacon and smile), then duck fat will be right up your alley. Different flavors, but the same savory experience. If you stick with a dog and fries, it is a pretty cheap meal. Once you venture into the wonderful world of specialty sausages, the costs begin to rise. But, just as the wait, the cost is worth it. And finally, the rumors about the tattoo are true! I asked Doug and he told me that if you get the Hot Doug's logo tattoo, you get free Hot Doug's for life. The Rules: 1. It has to be big enough (check with Doug for actual size requirements). 2. Doug won't always ask to see it, but when he does, you have to be ready to show it. 3. You get your food for free, not the people who you bring with you. 4. You do not get to skip the line, as Doug says, ""That's crazy talk."""
772,"I love this place. Great gourmet sausages and a super friendly owner. The first person you see is the propitious owner Some sausages are better than others. The great array of normal sausages makes it affordable and still very delicious. The gourmet sausages are the fantastic.They change all the time. But from my experimenting with the special sausages, it has always been a rewarding experience. The regular sausages are equally as good and . I've had the andouille, polish and corn dog, all were exceptional. Don't believe the hype about the duck fat fries, they were not as good as the normal cheese fries. I ordered both with my girlfriend and we both finished the regular cheese fries and left the duck fat fries alone. It's a shame we really had high expectations for the duck fat fries. Three things that suck about this place: 1. The line on the weekend is ridiculous. Try to go during the week. 2. He closes incredibly early, 4pm and not open on Sundays. 3. It's cash only and the closest ATM's are blocks away."
773,Duck Fat Fries & Fois Gras Dog... enough said...
774,"After five years in Chicago, my pilgrimage to Hot Doug's finally came in the form of a couple dogs and cheese fries. Damned if it wasn't worth every last bite of hype. Just a twenty minute wait on a ninety-five degree day. I would have been happy to wait two or three times that long, though. I was thoroughly frightened of ordering and not having enough to eat. This would turn out to be a very baseless fear, but I'm glad to have done so anyway. I went with the bacon and sharp cheddar elk sausage with bacon-garlic mayo and mahon vonvallis shredded cheese. This was a last meal quality sausage. Every bite was a symphony of flavor. We're talking brass heavy symphony, too, not some girly woodwinds. Insurance came in the form of a Chicago style dog with everything and a ""small"" side of cheese fries. I was almost sated after the elk sausage alone, so I ended up forcing my friend to take down half of the Chicago dog. Doug himself was a friendly fellow and seemed to be cracking jokes with everyone that came through the line. He's gotta be burned out by the time 4:00 p.m. rolls around, but he's very much the genuine smiling face of his business, so kudos to him for that. There wasn't more than a table or two open at any given time, but if no one dilly dallies for too long, anyone who wants to eat in should be able to find a spot without waiting too long. There was a very diverse lunchtime crowd. Contractors with cell phones on the hip, white collar guys from across the street, hipsters, you name it. It's nice to see a place that all types of Chicagoans can enjoy. My friend dropped me off at Target after lunch, and I spent the better part of a half-hour in a full on food coma stumbling through the aisles, leaning on my cart for support, before I even picked up a single item.* I thought I would feel like death after an hour or two, as one often does after a lunch of this magnitude, but it never came. In fact, I've felt great ever since. Perhaps Doug's is the fountain of youth of encased meats? You'd better believe it will not take me another five years to make it back for the duck fat fries. *Don't act like you go to Target and only buy one thing."
775,"I'll be honest, as a New Yorker i normally stay away from the lines regardless of what people say about the quality of the food. This time I was the tourist with my father at the whim of my sister and her boyfriend. I'm glad i wasn't the one in control because i may have walked away immediately. This was by far the best dog(s) I've ever had. fantastic ingredients and wonderful spices... its hard to get a bad dog. Dont worry about which one you should get. you will not be bummed out... Doug was waiting at the register to take our order and really gets the concept of not rushing people through the ordering process. I committed to waiting as soon as i saw the line so you dont need to make it up to me by rushing me when i get to the front. That might be what i appreciated the most. Doug. He gets that its about the person at the front of the line. Not the back. get the italian style chicken sausage dog. its amazing!"
776,"First off, the neighborhood is TERRIBLE. It really is, I have no idea why nobody seems to mention the fact that this place is in the GHETTO in their reviews. I parked on the street (Uh, hello, a parking lot would be nice) about a half a block down from this 'restaurant' (if you can call it that) and was literally scared to death to walk, even that far in this area, with my kids. I walk up and see that there is a line, I FOOLISHLY thought someone would be kind enough to let me up into the front of the line, since I HAD MY KIDS and all, but no, of course. The best part was I was treated like some kind of monster for even trying. SO SORRY FOR TRYING TO KEEP MY KIDS SAFE, ok? We waited a good 15 minutes and the line was moving so slowly that my kids started getting restless and that was it, we left. Complete disaster, ZERO stars, will NEVER go back. Thanks for nothing."
777,"HOLY CRAP. I freaking love Hot Doug's. To be honest when I saw Doug I didn't really think he was all that hot. That all changed after my first bite. Every Doug does instantly became sexy. Sexy, sexy, tubed meat. Yes I had to stand in line for quite some time but I knew this going in so it wasn't much of a bother, especially since Doug definitely delivered on the hype. The duck fat fries were good but I don't think I would have noticed them from regular fries if I didn't know any better. For the dogs I got the Frois Gras and Atomic Dogs. Easily the best two ""hot dogs"" I've ever had. AMAZING. So amazing in fact I almost didn't want to finish. I mean it was so tasty I simply didn't want the meal to end. Eventually it did end and my love affair with Hot Doug's began. I've only been once but I plan to go again and again, totally lived up to the hype for me!"
778,"Chicago has a phenomenon that centers around the public TV show ""Check Please"": Whenever an eatery appears on it, and gets a rave review, the lemmings flock there and turn an enjoyable gourmet slum into a two-hour wait. Let's cut through the hype: Hot Doug's is good but not great. Doug creates the illusion of artificial scarcity but refusing to let anyone else man his cash register, and having long conversations with customers that keep the line moving at a snail's pace. Let's face it: After waiting an hour in line, even a tofu and boiled cabbage hot dog would taste wonderful. On at least three different occasions I've brought curious out-of-towners here, and every time the response was ""Meh"" and ""We waited one hour in a line around the block for this?"" (Plus, maybe I'm the only reviewer who feels this way, but Doug's resemblance to the Verizon Wireless Guy is a bit disturbing. But I digress.) Yes, I know: blueberry-bison-antelope-cilantro-truffle hot dogs and duck fat fries, blah blah blah. It's better than adequate, but not worth the wait. The thick-as-frosting cheddar spread on the cheese fries at Weiner's Circle is a much better bet."
779,"I know what you're thinking. There MUST be a reason all these people will wait in line for hours for a hot dog, right? That's definitely what I thought and why I decided to try Hot Doug's. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype. I came on a Friday around 11:30 and the line was halfway down the building (which is actually not bad). The entire visit took about 1 hour. We ordered a Chicago dog, fois grois dog, ""Mountain Main"" dog and duck fat fries. The Chicago dog was good but not worth waiting in line for. I can go down the street from my house to Portillo's and be just as happy. The fois dog was just what I was expecting it to be. Too rich. I couldn't even finish half. The ""Mountain man"" sausage was my favorite of the three but still not worth waiting in line for. And the duck fat fries tasted like regular fries. Would I come back? Sure, if the line is less than an hour long. The sausages here are tasty but not so much that I would stand in line for one."
780,"What can I say about Hot Doug's that has not already been said? I was lucky enough to stay with a friend living a short walk from Hot Doug's. I had the Chicago dog, and the foie gras dog. Both were delicious. Hot Doug himself was working the cash register. I bought a shirt. The line went out the door, but the service was fast. Perfect for a hot dog place on any level, any day."
781,"I'm an out of towner, so I understand that this is more of a ""touristy"" thing to do than an authentic Chicagoan thing, but still, the dogs were great. I'm also a vegetarian and the Joe Strummer was probably the best veggie dog I have ever had. We waited in line for maybe a half hour and after ordering we were served very quickly, and the staff was super friendly and helpful."
782,"Yes...like many here I came for the duck sausage and foie gras hotdog. I thought it was fitting since just only recently California banned foie gras. So as an ""in your face"" moment I had a few hours to kill in Chicago and being on a tight schedule to make sure I make it to my flight I dropped by here to get the infamous hotdog and savored every single bite. It's decadent for sure...but amazingly good. Every bite was worth the trip for me. 2 hours driving from Wisconsin and then off on a plane again..it was amazing. If I'd come back again to try out the other goodies they had here. The elk hot dog sound promising. One major thing is there is a line. A long line. I came here before it opened..maybe 10 minutes before there was about 10 people before me. Line does move fast since there's a system and they do get out orders pretty quick BUT you don't feel rush at all. Great friendly place and great eats. What else can you ask for?"
783,"Hot Doug's, Hot Doug's, my favorite place to beeeee! Expecting to try different places in Chi-town during our visit, we ended up at Hot Doug's twice in one week. About an hour wait, but SOOO WORTH IT!! Prices are reasonable and everything on the menu is heavenly amazing! My favorite out of all is the foie gras one and some chile/spicy one. Duck fat fries are yum yum. Love the crowd, no rude people or anything like that."
784,Food was good. Staffs were kind. I just do not understand this much hype and line.
785,"Yeah they have nice hot dogs but the disorganized restaurant is not what I would bargain for... There are places in Chicago which are crowded as this but way better managed... And to top it all , they offered garden hose water to the tired folks in the line....very generous!"
786,"If you live in Chicago. Is this the place to stop off to grab a dog and go? Nope. If you are from out of town, looking for a great representation of a Chicago-style dog? This is the spot! (or from the neighborhood looking for some great food!) I find it helpful to read a couple bad reviews, to help structure my good review ... Is there a wait to order? Yes. If you came alone, or with someone, you will most likely chat with someone new, or get to know who you are with a little better ..how horrible! Far too often, we scarf down a meal and move on. Here, you can take advantage of some creative menu choices, and since you waited, you can appreciate it a bit more, since it an ""experience"" rather than just another lunch ... Dog for $2 ...yeah! 10 out-of-the-ordinary menu choices? ...Uh huh! Colorful owner and helpful staff? ....yeppers! We need to have more ""experiences"", and less ""just_________ ""(fill in the blank). Kudos to you Doug, and all of your hotness."
787,"ENCASED MEAT HEAVEN! I came here on November 2010 and I STILL dream about the food here. I don't care if my review gets lost in the already 2000+ reviews for this place or if my review is even necessary to highlight how amazing the hot dogs are here. I would actually be doing myself a disservice by not writing a review of my experience. To this day, I still have not found a hot dog place that comes close to how delicious the food is here. I don't know what they do, but they're doing something right with encased meat. The boy and I came here on a cold November Saturday morning. If someone flicked my ear, I'm pretty sure it would have fallen off. And on top of that, we stood behind some cranky person in line who wouldn't let us through the door when we got close to the front of the restaurant just because she wanted to keep the cold air out. But no cold weather and cranky person could ruin our Hot Doug's experience. Between the two of us, we ordered: -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris (I can't say that ten times repeatedly because I'll be drooling after saying it once.) -Spicy Jerk Dog with Jerk Mayonnaise, Mashed Plantains and Baby Belletoile Cheese -Bison Dog: Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Bison Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mayonnaise and Irish Porter Cheese -Regular Chicago Dog -Duck Fat Fries Honestly, we didn't even touch the Chicago Dog and I honestly can't remember what the duck fat fries tasted like. It was all about the three special hot dogs we ordered. The Fois Gras duck sausage KILLED IT! But my personal favorite was the Spicy Jerk Dog. The cheese, plaintains, and mayonnaise surprisingly went well together and just melted in my mouth. And it had a slight, spicy kick to it. And the Bison Dog was smoked to perfection and had HUGE blocks of cheese that crushed easily in our mouths. The quality of the sausages here is seriously top notch. Smoked and grilled just right. Flavors really packed in there. Toppings complement the flavor of the meat. Not too dry, just succulently right. You know it's good sausage when you can hear and feel the encasing snap when you bite into the sausage. I dream about the day that I'll return to this heavenly place to take another bite out of their sausages. I'm having Foie Gras withdrawals in California! Enjoy!"
788,"Finally made it in!!! I have tried to go to Hot Doug's for um... 3 years? Apparently each time I had the idea to go, about 50 other people did too and the line was ridiculous! I didn't even get out of my car those times; I just kept on driving. But this one lucky day... on a Tuesday at 2:30pm... there were only 8 people in line. I don't eat beef or pork (don't judge), so I ordered one of the many chicken dogs and fries. Delicious! I think it would have been a 5 star experience if I tried one of the dogs they are really known for, but I will extrapolate and say, ""it's all good!"" Anyway, some advice for your trip to Hot Doug's: 1) Don't go on a weekend - unless you really, really want duckfat fries (only served on Friday/Saturday) 2) Avoid normal meal times - you will be hungry and angry and tired wayyy before you get a hot dog. 12pm is an awful time to go, even on a weekday. 3) If it's nice out, the line will most definitely be longer. Snow doesn't necessarily make the line shorter though. 4) Maximize your experience by ordering a lot. You never know when you might get back in... 5) And apparently order corn dogs 6) Bring yo' cash monies Enjoy :)"
789,"I'm late to the party, but I finally made it to Hot Doug's. Always frightened away by the lines, I came on a random Tuesday off. We waited about 20 minutes, not bad. I liked it, but honestly I like Franks n Dawgs better... is that wrong? I think it's the bread. Toasted lobster roll beats nondescript hot dog bun any day of the week. Also, I wish they melted the cheese onto the dog instead of serving it cold. I had to try the foie gras dog, which was as rich and fatty as it sounds. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was recommended by Doug when I asked him to choose between that and the Elk sausage, and it was good but didn't blow me away. My friend had a delicious Chicken Rosemary sausage. Their fries are handcut and served in huge portions. Drink refills are free! So yeah, it's really good. But I'd rather go to Franks n Dawgs (which had no wait) and sit on their backyard patio. Glad I went though, it can now be crossed off my Chicago bucket list. Oh, and Doug is as genuinely nice as everyone says."
790,"OMG Overrated! Everyone who raves about this place can't admit to themselves that it wasn't that good because it would undermine their ego. How could they just have waited in line for something that was just a hot dog. They can't. It's unfathomable. They are too in-the-know and culturally savvy to have been duped by consumerist fervor. They really did their research and KNOW that duck fat fries taste better. Guess what, you couldn't tell the difference if they didn't tell you. It's not all bad. In fact the hot dogs are ok. This place is fun and quirky. Different meats and toppings that are interesting. It's like a baskin robbins for hot dogs. It should also be like baskin robbins, or any other hot dog shop, and be fast. Superdawg, Herm's, Poochie's, Jean and Jude's, all make as good if not better hot dogs. You also don't have to wait 45 minutes listening to the people around you explaining to their friends and repeating to themselves that it's worth the wait. This is the mantra of the egoist foodie. They are suffering to experience something that others are not willing to suffer. With this suffering will come a superior product. It's the same thing people waiting outside night clubs tell themselves. It's not worth the wait. If you want a hot dog guess what? You're in Chicago! You can get the best hot dogs in the world pretty much anywhere. Another commodity are Bratwurst and Weisswurst. The original gourmet encased meat that's just not marketed correctly to the post-modern foodie. Weisswurst: Ground milk fed veal and minced pork belly sausage spiced with parsley, lemon, mace, onions, ginger, and cardamom. Served hot and topped with caramelized onions and stone ground mustard. Sounds amazing right. They serve it at most any German place."
791,"Yummy duck hot dog with foie gras and yummy cheese fries. Missed the duck fat fries, but thank you television for showing this place to me!"
792,"Doug is hilarious, and it never ceases to amaze me that he can do math in his head (go private school education go!). The food is worth the wait!! It's best come come early, preferably on a weekday, and def before the lunch-time rush for your best chances at a short line and a seat if you are eating in. The duck fat fries are good but only available on Fri-Sat. Also, cash only!! (and free soda refills!) The decor is eclectic, lots of conversation-starters as we sat down to enjoy our meal. The menu apparently does change, so check out their website for the current menu."
793,The duck sausage is really flavorful! I enjoyed the cheese fries too. I missed out on the duck fat fries because I went on a Thursday and they only have it on Friday s and Saturdays.
794,"Hot Doug's is one of the most famous restaurants in the city of Chicago. Arriving a little more than 30 minutes before they opened on a Saturday morning I was able to find street parking and my place in the already long line built up to enter this establishment. The line moves quickly and soon I was ready to place my order. Obviously, I had to try the Chicago style hot dog. I also tried the ""Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Smokey Bacon Sauce and Sage Derby Cheese"", and an order of Duck Fat Fries. To my delight Hot Doug's also had a cooler stocked with bottles of Green River soda. On to the actual food itself, the ""Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Smokey Bacon Sauce and Sage Derby Cheese"" I received was a delicious smoky sausage with bits of cheese on it. I can't really think of anything to compare the flavor to. This was absolutely fantastic and is one of the best things I've ever eaten. I seriously wish I could have bought a second one to take home without having to re-enter the line again. The regular Chicago-Style hot dog was a well steamed Vienna Beef dog, it came on a nice poppy seed bun, all of the regular Chicago style fixings were there. The pickle included wasn't long enough so that you could get pickle in every bite however. The sport peppers were slightly hotter than I preferred, overall this is a very good Chicago style hot dog, but certainly not the best. The duck fat fries were tasty and for the 3.50 or so they cost I got a huge amount of them. They tasted like normal fresh cut fries, there's a slightly different aftertaste to them compared to most places, these were good but on my next visit I'll stick with cheese fries. Overall, Hot Doug's is a great place to eat at. While there are better places to get a Chicago-Style Hot Dog. No one has a greater variety of unusual sausage combinations. It's hard for me to emphasize how fantastic the Buffalo Sausage was. I will definitely be making a return trip sometime in the near future. Big thumbs up!"
795,"4 stars for food 5 stars for service Had the Fire Dog char grilled w/o relish add sport peppers. Tasty but a bit salty. The small fries are very generous, hot and tasty. Skin on. Tax INCLUDED in prices, which is great. CASH ONLY! :("
796,"Hot Doug's - are the hot dogs good? Yes. Are they worth the 45 minute wait? Not IME (and definitely not if you're waiting 1+ hours). As we were waiting in line, someone heading out suggested that we get the saucisson, so I saw it on the menu and ordered it. It was a bacon sausage and was it was not my favorite - the sausage was way too tough and it wasn't juicy as it should be. My bf's ribeye sausage hot dog was better and had add-ins that complemented it well, but it wasn't amazing either. We also split the foie gras and duck sausage, topped with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse. That one was better than expected, but once again, not worth the wait. We also got the duck fat fries, and I don't understand why everyone raves about them because they taste like your average fries. I give them props for draining the oil well so that they weren't greasy, but a few were already slightly soggy by the time we got our batch."
797,"I been to this place a few times and I always go just before opening and on fridays, the wait is around 20-30mins. Foie Gras Hot Dog is awesome, but lots of fat, very heavy & rich. If you come with a friend, I only recommend that you share one, and try other stuff. Actually I recommend 1/2 foie gras dog per person. The duck fat fries lack in favor, but it is worth trying if you never had it. The portion is large and shareable between 4 people. Hot Doug's also has hot dogs made with exotic meats and their menu always changes. The prices for these special dogs and the foie gras dog is around $7-10. I also recommend that you get one of their regular chicago dogs. It's about $2 and it's the best I've had in the city and I have tried a few highly rated places."
798,"During the sixties and into the late seventies a whole generation of liberal white Americans participated in numerous counter cultural movements including joining with Black and brown human rights activists and every day people to fight for justice from Selma Alabama to Vietnam . Today their children can be found standing in long lines at Hot Dougs. Hot Dougs is a right of passage and an usherance into a cultural club of American pop consumerism. I went there once along time ago with a friend from India who was studying American political culture during the 1960's and 70's and I felt bad when I could not explain why so many seemingly educated Chicagoans could make an event out of standing in a long line in the cold to eat greasy fries and designer nine dollar hot dog that taste similar to a polish suasage or bratwurst sold down the street for a a dollar ninety five. All I could say was out of Woodstock, mass consumerism based upon nostalgia for 1950's segregation replaced civic engagement for white liberals in the form of cultural phenomenas like Hot Dougs cause, you know the Elvis dog is just so like uhm totally rad. What's hilarious is that suburanites and tourist from Iowa call Hot Dougs ""the quintessential Chicago experience"" How ridiculous is that? Studs Terkel and Mike Royko would spit down from above if they heard this. So the moral of the story is, if you want the quintessential Chicago experience don't go to any place where consumer driven hipsters are standing in long lines. Real Chicagoans don't go to places like that for a hot dog. Also, Chicago isn't 98 percent white, which should be another dead give away with respect to authentic or quintessential, unless it's a Cubs game. Finally, any place with Maui chicken or ""foie gras"" in their hot dogs? Not real Chicago. And I doubt it's really ""foie gras"" because its banned in Chicago so I'd think PETA would be up in arms if a ""politically correct"" place like Hot Dougs broke that law. Well actually it would make sense for a politically correct place like Hot Dougs to brake an anti cruelty law because that's what they do for a buck. Now if you wanna the best Polish in Chicago, go to Sam's Red Hots on the Armitage, just remember no one has ever died from eating there and the Latin Kings and Insane Unknowns on the corner are far more entertaining than jabbering hipsters with captions over their heads that read ""Empty"""
799,"Changing to a five, been back 3 times great service, amazing price, tastiest food."
800,"I stopped reading somewhere between the 1694th and 1843rd review and I guess I'll just give you my take on things. Going to Hot Doug's is like going to see the Mona Lisa. You spend most of your day planning for the voyage, hoping for a spiritual experience, only to find something small and marginally interesting behind the velvet rope as you are fight your way through the crowds. This guy is a genius. You go to any city in the US and say ""I'm from Chicago"" and people will say ""ohh...Hot Doug's!"" I don't know how he has been able to get the spin machine working but I think I needed to fend off at least three different Food Network crews while I was there at 1:48 on some random Tuesday. Excellent product but not culinary nirvana. Well prepared, well-conceived and well-crafted sausages. But it's a sausage, and if you or I made a sausage (even our first crack at making a sausage) it would taste 80% as good because it's just salty meat. Elk tastes like bison tastes like alligator tastes like pig tastes like turkey tastes like lips and assholes. The food is good. The line obviously adds mystique. There is no magic here. I can't really offer any better options but if you want ""Chicago Dog"" go to Portillo's or, hell, Home Depot. I'm handicapping a 3.5 to 4 star meal with a huge BS factor (ala Kuma's Korner)."
801,"He says: Hot Doug's is a visionary of sausage wonders. On a long weekend to Chicago, we went there twice. Both times were delicious and we ordered a sizeable chunk of the menu, all told. That sizable chunk of menu was later found in our lovehandles. As a general rule, the ""standard"" dogs were better than the flashy dogs. Mind-Bendingly Good (in order of preference): * Thuringer - Best dog ever. A perfectly charred dog with a perfect mix of garlic? * Chicago - Awesome. The pickle, the snap of the dog, I want one right now. * Chicken & Gruyere - Melts in your mouth into a puddle of cheesy deliciousness Also Awesome: * Elk - Great flavor, but a bit drier than the perfectly oozing dogs above. * Andouille - If my local market did this as well, I'd have sausage weekly. Tasty, but not for me: * Duck & Fois Gras - It's rich, it's tasty, but while I like it... I'd much rather have 4 of the Chicago dogs. And, due to the price differential, I can have that for the same price. Protip: They can prepare any dog as: charred, fried and grilled, deep fried, or steamed. The charred versions seemed tastier (even compared to a fried and grilled dog). They do a great job with that preparation, so I'd go with it. Fried and grilled is a close second. Also, Doug was awesomely friendly despite the fact that we had very little idea what we were doing. He seemed genuinely surprised that our group came all the way from PA and Kentucky to eat his dogs. She says: I always thought the expression ""foodgasm"" was weird and slightly scandalous -- but, the first time I bit into a hot dog here (Chicago), I had one. It was incredible. The dog was juicy, delectable, and charred just right, perfectly dressed. To this day, Hot Doug's is the only place to have ever given me a foodgasm. Doug knows his meats. Be sure to enjoy the basics as well as try some unusual (to me) game meats. I second my guy's preferences above."
802,"So I had what I thought was an ingenious idea and decided to check this out during NATO Monday since I had the opportunity to work from home. Apparently hundreds of other people employed in the loop worked from home that day had the same damn idea, so we still had to wait over an hour during lunch time. I admit I hated the fact that I looked to be apart apart of the sheepish Chicago ant-mentality of shamelessly waiting in long lines for trendy basic food spot, but I wasn't disappointed when we finally got a seat. The dogs were amazing. Even more impressive was the fact that the fries were great, when normally spots like this skimp on their quality. And Doug was cool as hell, you can tell he definitely cares about his customers through his interaction. My homie wanted 3 dogs but was slightly short, Doug just told him to give him whatever he had. He also suggested I get the smaller drink rather than the large in order to save money since there were free refills. Doug, you made a fan out of me. But don't expect me to come out on a Saturday. No way in hell."
803,"There are so many documentaries that chronicle good Hot-dog places around the United States; they often stop here - as I did. Blown away is an understatement. I don't like hot-dogs, in fact, I am disgusted by then. But they have an amazing veggie dog that I heard about all the time when I lived in the area. Went there, tried it, and then went for some more... for the next three years. :) The place is great. My only hassle - so many people know of this little gem! Given any day of the week, you are expected to be in a packed place. No surprise when you see the line from the store and down and around the block. I'm serious. Go and enjoy!"
804,"Wow. One of my favorite places. The specialty dogs are a bit pricey, but it makes sense why. The Portuguese Linguisa with Iberico cheese was probably my favorite, but I haven't had one I didn't like. I think I have tried 7 different specials now, along with a Chicago style dog and a polish. Everything was excellent. The regular dogs and sausages are priced normally. If you are able to, call your order in and go pick it up. There is a minimum (I think it was $25 and it's cash only) for a pick up order but it's worth it and it's easily met with 2 people. I only say this because it is has been slammed each time I've been there. When I went in to pick up my order, the person taking money and orders (I think it was Doug) was very friendly and cordial. It's nice to see when people are busy they can actually be friendly still. Try this place, for sure."
805,"Doug is pretty cool. He took our order and sat us down soon after. We had the whole fam bam with us. All 7 of us. The line was really long and stretched around the block. They have a very unique menu and lots of good eats to choose from. It's not your typical hot dog spot, so be ready to explore different meats and new tastes. Bring your adventurous tongues and stomachs! The only thing was that it was wayyyy crowded in the restaurant. Maybe because I'm used to all the space we have in Texas that it felt cramped. Come on the weekend and get duck fat fries. Sooo good!"
806,"My life has forever been changed by encased meats. This was the proclamation one man made as I was walking into Hot Doug's yesterday. After waiting about 25 minutes on a Monday afternoon, I knew that this man had to be right. Once we were inside HD's, Doug was at the counter taking orders. I had scanned the menu and knew what I wanted and Doug was incredibly friendly and efficient. He truly knows how to run a successful business. You are not to sit until after you order-this ensures that you will get a seat no matter what. Because of this my friends and I sat down and were promptly served our food. I ordered the ""Celebrity Sausage"", which was a shrimp and pork dog topped with grits, grainy mustard and goat cheese. Not only was the sausage uniquely flavored, but the contrast of flavors and textures on this dog were incredible. My mind was blown. We also shared the Chicago Dog which was delicious. And the fries? Ok, I know I didn't come in on a duck fat day but I can only imagine how delicious they must be. These regular fries were just crispy enough and delicious. I would consider myself lucky to have waited less than half an hour to eat at Hot Doug's. I would easily wait another hour to taste this deliciousness again. Upon leaving I was almost moved to make the same proclamation as that man said upon my entrance."
807,"I'm sorry but that janken P person is an idiot. First off the area isn't ""ghetto"" at all, go back to Lincoln park if you're so scared. Also having your kids with you so you think you have the right to jump in line?! Obviously don't need to be in Chicago if you're so scared."
808,"I have wanted to come here ever since I saw the place on No Reservations. We waited about an hour to get in, and I got the South African Beef and Pork boerowoers (or however it is spelled). Also, duck fat fries. The good: I like that Doug uses your name after he asks for it. He did it with EVERYONE in line that I heard. That means a lot. The sausage was GREAT, and the mustard, and the cheese on it was fabulous too. The only thing I was wondering, maybe someone can tell me, but the duck fat fries seemed dry and overdone. Could that have been just that batch? GREAT experience otherwise, I would definitely go back!"
809,FOIE GRAS!!!!! Worth EVERY minute in line and EVERY penny paid.......Love EVERYTHING about these delectable sausage creations. A MUST go while in Chicago!
810,"The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, was decent. I felt that the duck sausage was extremely gamey. I also tried the Antelope Sausage with Sweet & Spicy Pepper Mayonnaise and Saint Nectaire Cheese, I loved the Mayo and the cheese, but again I felt the game-ness of the Antelope meat was over powering. However, when eating Antelope you expect game-ness. My favorite was the Alligator!! It was juicy, slightly sweet from the toppings. It was phenomenal. Luckily I went on a weekday and the wait was only about 30 mins."
811,"I love this place. The corndogs are amazing, the simple chicago dog rules. Of course the crazy encased meats rule as well. Bring cash, and double check their hours of operation before you go."
812,"CASH ONLY!!! Prices include tax. I've been a pretty regular customer here for years, so the gang knows me by my nickname. Their revolving Specials menu is bookmarked on my cell phone and computer. I stick to the beef and/or pork sausages since I am not a huge fan of chicken sausages or game meats, which I hear are excellent if you are more adventurous than I am. Doug has perfected the flavor combinations between the sausages and their individual toppings for each Specials menu item. Please don't be a boob and order a regular hotdog with the traditional fixins. You can do that at the Home Depot hot dog stand. Hot Doug's is a dining experience and deserves more respect than that. I don't think many people know you can order tater tots, and I actually prefer them over the fries. TATER TOTS! The line can be long but it moves fairly quickly. Totally worth the wait as long as you don't go in to order just a regular hotdog. Once you have ordered, you don't need to stand in line again if you decide you want more food - just ask one of the guys or gals on the floor and they will collect your cash and put the order in to Doug for you. For those ordering to-go, the sausages are wrapped up in paper so they are super easy to reheat."
813,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Yes, there's a line. Yes, you can't wait to get in the door to see what the specials are. Yes, Doug is a nice man at the register who seems to make up the prices in his head (often in the customer's favor). The line is so long in fact that we figured out our entire wedding guest list by typing it into an iPhone - all 220 names. Ya gotta do something to make the hour go by, right? We had the chicken mole sausage (spicy) and some alligator. We've had the regular hot dog a few times. All really good. Not fans of the andiuolle sausage. The prices are reasonable considering what you get (think about Doug's prices next time you order food at a Chicago festival). Finally had the duck fat fries. They were good fries, but I guess my taste buds aren't sophisticated enough to differentiate what makes them so special. I like to cover my fries in ketchup anyways. We'll of course be back for the whole experience - again and again. This might be the only restaurant we eat at over the next several months, seeing how much a wedding costs :)"
814,".., sometimes the best way to get to know an animal, is to put it in your mouth. I get slightly envious, but fall more in love with a city that has a personality only Chicago can provide. Hot Doug's is an experience all it's own. The menu itself is a tasty educational treat that'll leave you wanting more. Many thanks to Misha Media for treating me while we were in town!!! We got here right at lunch & the line wasn't too far down the sidewalk, but there was indeed a line. No worries though, it does move on along. All the more time to salivate & build an appetite. Unless you know what you already want, Doug's menu will keep you undecided for everything sounds good. The prices are ridiculously reasonable so I suggest to try more than 1 dog. CASH ONLY!!! Just a heads up so you don't wait in line for nothing. I went along & got one of their specials which was a Cognac & Bacon Pheasant sausage w/ Chevre Cream, Wild Boar pate & Truffle Balsamic drizzle. Accompanied with an order of cheese fries & a corndog. WOW, what a dog! The flavor in that sausage was excellent, great combo of all things tasty, that Truffle Balsamic drizzle was like liquid crack. The Wild Boar Pate was diced up & sprinkled on top, I thought it was cheese at first because they have the same consistency, but you can pick up a hint of that boar. The cheese fries were heavenly, had that ooey gooey cheese that I love & the corndog was great as well. Had outdoor seating feeling the windy city doing it's thing. Added more to the experience. Hot Doug rang us up himself as well, we'll definately come back. Great food & good times, check it out!"
815,"Hot Doug's is a part of my history! I went to Lane Tech for high school and I use to go to Doug's when it was on roscoe and Oakland. The place was so different from big boy gyros and other hot dog places. My lunch mates and I loved the dogs and we went almost EVERYDAY our sophomore year- he even signed our year books. It was so hip and he'd put vh1 on the tv. I still have a monkey pin I got from Doug's and I keep it on an old belt I had. I feel like I've seen Doug's place grow from the beginning and he has remained genuine. First time I had rabbit, elk, buffalo, antelope, kangaroo and much more. My favorite was something called the frankenwurst- 10in hotdog with 1.5 in diameter- stupendous. I'd go eat Doug's and then go to gym class and outperform everyone due to the warrior topping on hot Doug's dogs. Then, it happened. Dougs burned to the ground. The people above him were careless and and those hot dogs were too charred. However, like the Phoenix Doug is, he rose from his ashes and moved across the river. 1st day he opened a new location, I ran during lunch to get there. I literally climbed the fence separating high school property from public property, crossed the river and ran to Doug's all sweaty and all- I felt like the girl in ""The Village"" finding the cure for Joachim Phoenix. Ever since, Doug is so nice and he knows what it means to make loyal customers. Anyway here's the low down: Price- great price for what you get. Regular dog is $1.50 (cash only). Special dog is around $7 but they are so unique- fois gras done, chicken peanut dog, alligator...dog. Quality- can' be beat. Char dog is my fav. My friend use to love char and fried. Fries are good to and very homemade. Quantity- you can get a good amount of food for what you pay- Frankenwurst- $10 maybe. Atmosphere- lots of blue, red and yellow. Very retro place with lots of memorabilia. Staff- Doug is rude- he's like his own Ed debevics but he's actually loveable. He gives tough love and has helped me grow in my career. Check this place out and buy as much as you can because you probably won't go everyday- unless you are a sophomore at lane tech and have 4th period lunch"
816,Food is great but doug can have a snobby/elitist attitude
817,We plan our Chicago trips around visiting Hot Doug's. Soooo good. The best hot dog place in the world? I would say so...
818,"Great place. Had the foie dog as well as the merguez sausage, both were absolutely delicious. Very flavorful and moist sausages, and great flavor combinations with the toppings. Doug was there both times I have been and is very friendly. He clearly cares a lot about his business. Get there early as the line gets long, but once you order there are usually tables available and the service is fast."
819,"So I took my second visit to Hot Doug's in my second visit to the Windy City. I'm pretty sure Hot Doug's will be a staple-stop on all return visits. I'll break down both my visits on this review: #1 - This visit took place back in April of 2011. I was by myself and it was on a weekday for lunch. I got there at about 11:00 and there was a line just outside the door. The wait to order was about 20 minutes. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Sausage with plantains and remoulade. It was quite simply one of the tastiest items of food that have ever entered my mouth. After the first bite all I could think about was how long I could take savoring this sausage. I even looked at the line and considered getting back in line to order another one. The fries were solid but not spectacular. I'm not a fries guy anyway and immediately regretted not just ordering two sausages. I can't explain how well the flavor of the sausage worked with the plantains and remoulade. It was just perfect. #2 - This time the visit took place on Friday, July 27th. This time I also had the family with me (wife, 9-year old son, 12-year old daughter). I ordered the game of the week. It was a Kangaroo Sausage with Yellow Pepper Aioli, and Goat Feta Cheese. It was outstanding. The kangaroo had a very different flavor that I can't really describe but it went very well with the condiments. I also ordered the Norm Crosby, which is a German Thuringer sausage with beef, pork, garlic and other spices. It was very good also. I got mine with spicy mustard and tomatoes. My wife ordered the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Creole Mustard, Hominy Grits, and Goat cheese. She got hers minus the grits. The Creole Mustard and Goat Cheese were too rich for her so she scraped it off and put mayo on it. Thank god Doug didn't see it or he might have banned us from the restaurant. I almost slapped her for the sheer embarrassment. After she only ate 1/2 of hers I reapplied the creole mustard and goat cheese and finished hers. It was even better than the Kangaroo. Daughter got the Polish and son got the Italian. They were both solid, but to me the way to go is the specials. In closing I can't recommend Hot Doug's enough. But get the specials, not only because of the sausage, but the special condiments add a world of flavor."
820,"I wish I was able to have a full experience here so I can tell you exactly how this place went down. I came here on a weekday so I wasn't able to try their duck fried french fries. However; I skipped the long line and was able to enjoy my specialty hot dog in less then 15 minutes. Can't quite remember what I got anymore, but I do remember that Doug was not shy from telling me how I should have my hot dog. When you order, you get to pick your toppings and the way your ""dog"" is prepared (grilled, charboiled, etc). When I went up to order, Doug disagrees with my choices and told me how it is REALLY done! There's no way Doug, the man himself, would let me down so I told him to bring out the way just how he would like it. Sure enough, it was pretty good. Kind of wish I was able to try the fries, but it was not bad for my first time here."
821,"First of all, boy am I happy I waited all of about 15 minutes... cause I would be giving them a 2 or a 1 star depending on how long my wait would have been. We decided to see what the hype was all about so we headed on our way down on a tuesday afternoon. The line was short and sweet and there were many choices to choose from, so we ordered a total of 5 dogs 4 from the specialty list and 1 bridget bardot. (see my pic) and an order of fries, too bad it wasn't the weekend or I would have opted for the fries cooked in duck fat. As we sat down we got our food in 5 minutes of less... Which was good since we were starving! When I looked at my dogs they didn't look very appealing at all and kinda on the small side for what they were charging, my bill was 45.00! And I was even more disappointed when I took a bite out of each and every one of my dogs ;0(... Nothing to rave about at all! I believe that all good hot dogs should have a snap when you bite into it, none of my dogs had this ;0(... Overall the service was prompt but my search for the perfect encased meat continues..."
822,"After living in Chicago for almost 7 years, I finally made it to Hot Doug's for the first time. I went with three other people on a Saturday morning. We arrived a little after 10 and there was already a line of about 20 people. The place opens at 10:30, so we had a little bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad. Once it opened, the line moved fairly quickly. We lucked out because we got the last table available for 4 people. I chose to stick to the basics and ordered two Chicago dogs plus a side of the duck fat fries to share. These Chicago dogs were the best I've had, no doubt about it. The people I was with ordered a variety of things, including the rattlesnake dog, which they all raved about. The duck fat fries were good, but not great. I've definitely had better fries elsewhere. I would certainly come back here for more hot dogs, however. I'll have to remember to come here during the week sometime when I have a day off."
823,"Most Amazing Birthday Lunch Ever! My bf and I visited Chicago for a short vacation. We share the same birthday, and wanted to have a fun, outrageous, and only-in-Chicago experience. After spending the early afternoon on the Architecture Foundation Boat Tour, we took a cab to Hot Doug's (we walked to the nearest CTA station afterwards, and it was a pretty far and somewhat shady journey). It was a Wednesday afternoon, so the line wasn't long. Only 2 people out the door as opposed to the block-long line you would see on Fridays and Saturdays. True, coming on the weekday means no duck fat fries, but we came for the hot dogs. Plus, I would imagine that locals avoid Hot Doug's during those tourist days. Instead, the weekday line is populated with locals - we struck up a long conversation with the guy in front of us who lives nearby and visits Hot Doug's once a week! Following the local's advice, we ordered off the Specials menu: Saucisson Alsacienne, Antelope Sausage, and of course, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. Doug was there taking the orders - it's very refreshing to meet the owner of a small business, and all the more reason to visit Hot Doug's. My bf and I split the three hot dogs, so that we could both taste each one. The Antelope Sausage was lean yet juicy, with a spicy mayo sauce and sliced cheese, slightly melted. The Saucisson Alsacienne with its creme fraiche and cheesy toppings provided a great contrast: a spicy hot dog followed by a smooth and creamy one. But the showstopper was the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage! The duck sausage was incredibly meaty. The truffle aioli and bursts of fleur de sel added depth and flavor. And the foie gras came as 4 perfectly round discs, artfully layered on top. I've seen various photos on Yelp of the foie gras served as a crumbled mess - perhaps we lucked out! The trip out to Hot Doug's is definitely worth it, even without the duck fat fries. A 10-minute wait to eat the most delicious, savory and unique hot dogs ever!"
824,Believe the hype....!!! ...THE REAL DEAL... Can't wait to go back next time i'm in Chi-town.
825,"My dad wanted to get a Chicago style hot dog since I moved out here 3 years ago. For whatever reason, it has taken this long for us to get our act together and get that darn hot dog. During my parents' most recent visit in April, I sifted through tons of reviews and decided to take them to Hot Doug's, as it appeared to be the leader of the pack. This place absolutely did NOT disappoint! I read that it gets crowded and to be prepared for a wait, so we arrived about 30 minutes after opening. The line was already out the door and starting to form along the side of the building, which appears to be the norm. By the time we got to the counter to order we were hungry and ready to go! I tend to expect big hotspots like this to have a snooty, stuck up way about them - like how some philly cheesesteak places in philly yell at you for asking for ketchup - but Hot Doug's was the opposite. The man taking our order (Doug?) took his time with us first-timers, explaining the menu and how to order exactly what we wanted. He also answered all my dad's questions about the meat. And to top it all off, the three of us were stuffed for a mere $20 bill, which included 3 really tasty root beers. I'm recommending this place to everyone, and will be bringing any first time visitors to the city here!"
826,"Duck sausage with foie gras mousse (earthy n creamy) and pork sausage with cranberry cream cheese (smokey and sweet). Snappy sausage, perfect pairings. The split top bun is simple yet chewy enough to provide some texture that holds all the ingredients together. They close at 4pm and cash only. Doug is at the counter taking orders; so nice and easy going. Duck fat fries on fri n sat (couldn't tell the difference). There will be a wait. don't bother with the regular menu. Get the specialties. 2 people should share at least 3 dogs."
827,"OH MY GOD! I LOVE HOT DOUG'S! It's the best hot dog place ever! Ok, the line is a long line, but well worth the wait! We had gotten 4 dogs, a large basket of fries, and the chili to split between 3 people (as well as ordering an extra dog when we were done). Just because the foie gras hot dog was THAT amazing. Best hot dog hands down. We had also gotten the Elk dog (it was good), the veal (delicious), and a spicy seafood one (also delicious, but a bit salty). The duck fat fries were good, but I didn't really taste the difference. Also, the 40 sausage chili is good, but since you can't distinct each sausage flavor, it basically tastes like chili. But there is a good bit of sausage in it. I'd totally wait in the 1+hr line again, except this time, order way more hot dogs."
828,"Big big fan. I wasn't sure it would live up to its reputation, but it sure does. Bring cash. Be patient if there's a line. I arrived on a summer Friday around 11am, and the wait was about 30 minutes. Like everyone claims, the owner Doug Sohn takes your order and couldn't be more friendly. He's very patient and gives s recommendations to those who are overwhelmed with all the delicious-sounding sausages available that day. After placing your order, find a seat and prepare yourself for what's about to come. The food comes out shortly. Then you feast, and your stomach becomes very happy. Mr. Sohn announces two sausages of the week on the Faceook page and Twitter. You can also check their website for the other sausages currently on rotation. (Hot Doug's closes for vacation on certain holidays and random days so it's smart to check Facebook, Twitter, or their website beforehand to make sure you're not making the trip to this sausage mecca only to be disappointed). Many of the sausages and their accompanying sauce/toppings change often so you can visit Hot Doug's many times and never have the same item twice. I haven't come across a bad one yet. The buns are soft and fresh, but they aren't toasted, buttered, etc like Franks N Dawgs. It doesn't matter though because these sausages and toppings are outstanding (far superior to Franks N Dawgs in my opinion). While many people love the duck fat fries available on Fridays and Saturdays only, they are thinner than their regular fries. I prefer a thicker cut fry so I actually like the regular fries more. The regular and duck fat fries are great, but focus on the sausages. Glorious. Prices are more than reasonable as well. One of my favorite spots in Chicago. Highly recommend!"
829,"Chances are with almost 2000 reviews on Hot Doug's already, you are not reading my lil ole review. I'm probably going to repeat what others have written...duck fat fries, foie gras, yada yada yada. I don't care, this was an amazing experience and I'm going to sing my heart out. Arrived here on Good Friday a little after 10am to find a line (already!) of other meat eaters on a Friday during Lent. It doesn't matter what your religion is, when you come to Hot Doug's you celebrate the religion of delicious encased meat. all are welcome! And visiting with a group of meat lovers is a great way to worship! I ordered the Duck Sausage and the bro and I decided to split the Lamb Sausage and the Chicago Dog. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, topped with Truffle Aoili, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de sel. This is one super rich dog. The sausage was delicious and I loved the Truffle Aoili. The Foie definitely added the richness, I couldn't finish it, I think if I order it next time, I'll ask for more Aoili and half of the Foie. I loved the Aoili--I kept dipping the delicious fries in it. The Lamb Sausage, topped with spicy Harissa and Feta. This was very tasty also. I didn't like the texture of the sausage (a little dry for me), but the flavors together was good. The Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Goat Cheese--I got to try this one and even though it was only a couple of bites, this one was definitely my favorite of the day. So flavorful--who knows, if i had a whole one, i might have left speaking a cajun accent! The poor Chicago Dog was almost an afterthought since I was already full from the other dogs. But the taste of Sweet Home Chicago was there--this was one solid dog. **For the stroller set. This is not the place to bring a stroller--unless HD is not full of folks. I got here when the place was fairly empty so my little guy in his umbrella stroller maneuvered well. (and we're talking the basic basic umbrella stroller--the one that looks like it's for dolls. Anything bigger would have been a horrible hindrance) Grab the table in the corner near the window--a great place for stroller and table as there's not room for anything else and stroller is out of the way of anyone tripping. Because of the long line we had to walk through on leaving, I carried little boy out while my brother carried the folded stroller. Worked well without running over people's feet with stroller wheels. If I would have gotten here any later, said stroller would have stayed in the car and I would have toted the prince in the baby bjorn. Momma comes prepared!"
830,"I feel that the stars have properly aligned and that I am now at a point where I can write a proper Hot Doug's review. For so long, I struggled to verbalize how this place has changed my perception of good food, to tell about my experiences in general, and essentially change my life. Basically, this is probably the most meaningful yelp review I've ever written and may ever write, so I really wanted to get it right. Here goes. I have been going to Hot Doug's on a regular basis since approximately late 2008, so I am a bit of a late bloomer. It's foggy, but that's the best I can pinpoint. I am proud to say that I actually did not find out about Hot Doug's through the Foie Gras controversy, or the Travel Channel or something like that---this was a word of mouth recommendation, and the fact that they have so much variety but basically only one form factor of a sandwich, was what appealed to me the most. I can't actually say I've ever eaten a bad thing on the menu here. Everything has essentially been 5 star. The thoughtfulness and harmony of the flavors, the gourmet influence is so obvious here. Everything is so well thought out and prepared. I like the rotating menu as well. There are some items that are repeated from time to time and never changed (Hot Doug's BLT, Sonoran Dog, Beef Sausage w/ Coca-Cola BBQ Sauce), there are some that are repeated but one or two things changed (Linguisa, Mountain Man Sausage, Uber Garlic-Pork, etc). There are the regular choices (Duck w/ Foie Gras, Chicago Dog, Italian Sausage, etc). From time to time, also, they bust out a DAMN good bowl of sausage chili topped w/ cheddar and onions. That is a Hot Doug's special appearance, so grab it when you can. The atmosphere is happy, childish almost, and rather comical/entertaining. A place that describes itself as ""The Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium"" HAS to be somewhat entertaining, and all sorts of funny pictures, a ""Hot Dog Timeline"" and the menu itself, even has funny names and descriptions on it. Doug has a collection of hot dog toys and memorabilia under his counter, too, which is worth paying attention of. My particular favorite is the hot dog tape. I need that when I move next. Doug, himself, is worth a special mention. I'm not sure how he does it quite frankly. The man is a true personality. He is one of those people that is ""the nicest guy you'll ever meet"" and it's always consistent. To stand up there and take orders for six hours, have people ask ""how's this, how's that"", deal with a consistent stream of customers is trying. I've never seen him lose it. He's always got an extremely genuine smile on his face, a wonderful, cheerful demeanor, and a personality. The fact that he focuses on the customer in front of him for anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes is very meaningful to me, and the fact that he remembers me by name is also meaningful. This also helps the flow of customer from line, to counter, to seat. Oh, you'll always get a seat here. They don't let people who haven't ordered sit down, and for this reason and some magic controlled chaos, it all just works. If you get wise, you will learn the times that Hot Doug's isn't busy, and you will go and experience it in those times. Pretty much any weekday before noon is a great time to go, aside from Friday. Monday can be slightly crowded (they are closed on Sunday's so a little demand builds). Tues, Weds, Thurs are always great, and always when you can find me there. It's in the middle of nowhere so drive or be prepared to walk from a bus line, but I assure you---it's worth the trip. All in all, I can't ever imagine not having Hot Doug's as a Chicago institution. What Doug Sohn has done for inexpensive, thoughtfully prepared, delicious, gourmet food is unbelievable. Hot Doug's is the reason I appreciate food and think about it so much. It is where it all began for me, and it's a great place for it to begin for anyone. It really is an amazing stepping stone. Who doesn't like a good hot dog? Start out at a Chicago Dog or an Italian Sausage, work up to the Hot Doug's BLT, and graduate with a Foie Gras. I will be very, very sad (yet it will be very bittersweet), if it ever disappears from the Chicago dining scene. I personally am of the opinion it is in the top three (maybe top two) restaurants in the City of Chicago. With a 27/30 Zagat score, it's also in the top ten in the country. Hot Doug's is significant and should not be ignored. All in all, this is absolutely my favorite place to enjoy food and I literally tell everyone I meet/talk to about food about it. It's just too perfect. When I sit down at the table at the end of my life and balance out the accounting books, everything will come up completely even, partially because of Hot Doug's. I feel so complete because I have enjoyed going here so much. It should be a bucket list item for anyone. Absolutely perfect. In every way."
831,This must be where hot dogs go when they die. Cash only.
832,"If you could only eat at one place in Chicago, then this is the place that I'd tell you to go. It was certainly the most memorable. But if you want to come here, I'd recommend that you come early or prepare to wait a long time. The line always goes around the corner and it can go really far. Their most popular items are their Foie Gras Hot Dog and their Duck Fat Fries. The fries fried in duck fat are only available on Fri and Sat. The Foie Gras Hot Dog is surprisingly rich and creamy. They top the hot dog with generous portions of foie gras and a foie gras mousse. You can't miss the flavors. It has nice texture and it's a tasty dog. I can see why it is the most popular item. Hot Doug's also specializes in sausages featuring exotic meats. They've stuffed antelope, game, rabbit, alligator, corned beef, and even bacon into their casings. And they're all pretty solid. Their hot dogs are full of flavors...It's really hard to go wrong. I'd recommend choosing the dog with the flavors you're craving (eg: sweet, spicy, salty, savory, etc..). I'd also recommend that you get one of their regular Chicago dogs. It's only $2 and it's the best ""Chicago dog"" that i've had in the city. The sausage had a nice snap, the ingredients were fresh, and it was just a damn good hot dog. The duck fat fries were good fries, but I don't think that you're missing anything if you skip them. If you are only going to have one opportunity to come here in your life (as was the case for me), then I'd recommend that you get a Chicago Dog for $2, try their foie gras dog, and get one more exotic hot dog. If you have friends with you, then you can split more. I believe that if you're willing to brave the long lines, then you might as well make the most of your experience by coming with a respectable appetite. Bon Appetit."
833,"Hot Dougs is awesome. I went today and got there early, around 1030 am, and still waited in a short line. It seemed part of the experience but I'd of waited longer having known what was in store. Doug was behind the counter and took our order. He was polite and actually thanked us for our order. Classy! We saw the Ribeye steak sausage was new today so we ordered one along with an Alsacienne, Italian, Linguica, corn dog, and fries. Everything was outstanding!!!!! Seriously awesome. The Ribeye tasted like steak in tube form and the horseradish sauce on it was perfect. The Linguica with Saffron sauce and Iberico cheese was a flavor punch and very rich. (Recomended by Hot Doug himself when I asked). The Bacon sausage aka Alsacienee was mild and not nearly as rich as I expected even when topped with a mild blue cheese and Creme Fresh....seriously gourmet and perfect. The corn dog was light and delicious too. Hot Doug's fresh cut fries...not the duck fat variety, were some dam good fries. Not greasy, crispy, well seasoned, and very tasty. I can't wait to get me some duck fat fries next time. Eating for the first time at Hot Dougs just makes we want to return again...heck even tomorrow if I could. This place makes me happy to be overweight. No guilt, only goodness. Thank you Doug for the encased meat Mecca experience. If I could buy stock......l would."
834,"Arrived at Doug's at 245 pm and we finally got in and ordered about an hour later. The wait is no joke and when I visited it was freezing outside. With that said, I would have done it again in a heartbeat. My fiance and I ordered 3 sausages (1 for each and 1 to split). We ordered the rib-eye steak sausage, the chicken and ham cordon blue sausage and an andouille sausage and a side of duck fat fries. The Cordon Blue was my favorite! It had fantastic flavor and fried prosciutto on top. So very good and juicy..... The Rib-eye was my fiance's favorite. The Andouille was in no way disappointing, it was very very good. I know someone will probably put a hit out on me for saying this but.... the duck fat fries are overrated. They're OK, but I have had much better at nearby establishments. Can't wait to for my next visit. Wishing I would have also tried the dog with foie gras."
835,"I had already mentally braced myself for the line, so waiting in line with good company wasn't too bad. However, we may have underbudgeted our time here (took us approx 1hr, 15 minutes to order) so it pushed back our itinerary. Because of this, it made me question whether the line was worth it. Food: Foie Gras Hotdog -- Very interesting concept to put on hotdog. Extremely savory as I wolfed it down. Elvis -- I love polish hotdogs (Kielbasas) and they put relish, a pickle, and grilled onions on it. For $3, it was worth it. Overall rating: The food was a 5/5. However, the line made the experience less pleasurable (obviously out of anybody's control, but I feel necessary to factor it into my review). It reminds me of the Boiling Crab scenario. Is it worth it to wait this long for a similar experience you can get somewhere else? I think I'll agree with our cab driver in that there are comparable places out there without the wait. See attached picture for foie gras and elvis side by side."
836,"Hot Doug's really is the place to go for hot dogs and sausages. Hands down. Chicago-style hot dog? On the menu. Venison sausage? On the menu. Elk sausage? On the menu. I know what you're thinking, but it was absolutely fabulous. The inside is super small and fully decorated with almost every kind of hot dog and sausage-related signs and decor you can imagine. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes to just order our food. I definitely wouldn't call this place ""fast"" food by any means, but I think it's worth the wait. You're not allowed to sit down until after you order. Surprisingly enough, the tables turn over pretty quickly so no one is ever with food and without a seat. Once you place your order, it comes out fast and you consume it fast. I guess that's where the ""fast"" in the ""fast food"" saying comes from. The food is really good and it's fairly cheap too. I highly recommend the corn dog and the elk sausage. Also, get the duck fat fries. The bigger-sized fries are not that far off from regular fries, but the smaller-sized fries are unreal. I. Could. Not. Stop. Eating. Them. It was bad."
837,"Duck Foie gras?!? Yeah! Love them to death err well hunger. I have stood in lines in 90 degree scorching sun, pelting rain and jet lag. I go to Chicago just to eat there. I advise strangers I meet on a cross-country trip to please go there. I love Doug and his sense of humor, the decor, the food, the everything about Hot Doug's! Really go there, stand it, it's worth it. Also dress comfy, wear sunscreen and bring water, you will be standing in line for a while."
838,"I know this is a favorite for carnivores. But, I would like to add that their veggie dog is much better than any I've had, including the diner-style-counter at Whole Foods. Hot Doug's will also substitute the veggie dog on a specialty option. I had one with smoked gouda and blackberry mustard. The french fries were great. It was worth the 45 minute wait in near nineties heat. (I have never been there when there was not a line half way down the block.)"
839,"Not that this place needs another rave review but this is hands down my favorite spot in Chicago. I have never found anything like it and I have traveled a lot. The service and attention to detail that Doug offers is bar none. I remember upon my first visit that he even suggested I get the small cup while eating in to save on free refills. Wow! What a class act! Not to mention the game of the week, the sauccisson aliscienne and the foie gras sausage among others are one of a kind tastes that you won't find anywhere else. The duck fat fries are excellent with cheese (Sat and Sun only)."
840,"foie gras hot dog was amazing. super rich, and the sausage itself was so......tasty and delicious and flavorful and the foie gras mousse on top complemented perfectly with the sausage. Doug is like the nicest guy ever! on a weekday before noon the line wasn't bad at all but after we left the line had doubled! so get here early!"
841,I moved back. I go here every week.
842,"There are many restaurants in Chicago that have a Buzz Gap, where the buzz a particular place gets does not delivered in terms of how good the food is. There is something about people waiting in line and popularity in general that woos foodies into believing something is much better than it actually is. Hot Doug's is definitely not one of these places. If you live in Chicago, at one point or another you've heard about Hot Doug's-- about how good it is, and how hard it is to get inside the place. They're only open 6 days a week, for 5 hours a day, only accept cash, and there is almost always a line. ""Go during the week,"" people will say, ""because you will have to wait at least an hour on a Saturday."" You will wait that long on a Saturday and probably about 15-30 minutes on a weekday. But if you are free and up for it, by all means. The specialty Dogs run about $8.00, with normal dogs running about $3. The specialty are the way to go, because they are great and the menu changes. For example, ""The Dick Kelley"" is a Curry Pork and Veal Sausage with Spinach Raita and Queso Zamorano. The spinach sauce and shredded cheese on this were mouthwatering, as was the actual sausage. It's just one of the most unique set of flavors that you will get anywhere in the city. Most importantly, the flavors work together and aren't just piled on for quantity like an ""Awesome Meal Time"" dish. Kangaroo, Alligator, and other exotic sausage are also currently on the menu, each with a gourmet array of toppings. Doug's is definitely a touristy/popular place to go, especially after the Anthony Bourdain appearance, but it will cost you time and patience. For that reason, it's not a place that I want to take a group of friends/family if they're in town. But, if I do get off work early for a doctor's appointment, it's one of the first places for lunch that comes to mind."
843,"Not sure if there's anything left to say about this place that hasn't already been said. Having read about Hot Doug's in some magazine I can't seem to recall or maybe it was the travel channel, but regardless, I was going to drop by during my 3 day stay in Chicago as part of a cross country trip. I was not disappointed. I ended up getting 'The Dog', 'The Elvis', and my sister got 'The Sal' dog and we also got an order of the duck fat fries. We both got our hot dogs deep fried. My goodness, can hot dogs really be this good... Oh the 'snap'. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G One of the best hot dog joints in all of America."
844,"Holy duck fat dood, this place is the cats pajamas. 'nuff said."
845,"If you're in Chicago and you want one of best it can offer, go and try HOT DOUG'S. Their Foie Gras Dog is to die for! While waiting in line (there's always a line that winds around the building, so go early), I peered through the window to see these two guys taking their first bite into their Foie Gras dog. One of the guys just closed his eyes and went into ecstasy mode. It was funny watching this go down. Yet it also made my craving for one of Doug's gourmet Hot Dogs. You'll find the typical Chicago Dogs ($2.00) and Chili Dogs etc. All of these normal hot dogs that you can find anywhere will be under $5. But that's not why you CTA or drive all the way out to Hot Doug's. You go to Hot Doug's to enjoy their Special Menu. The Special Menu has one of kind hot dogs, like Foie Gras (THE BEST!!!), The Mountain (buffalo + elk + veal sausage!), Taco Hot Dog....I can't name it all. Just check out their website. The Foie Gras hot dog is (again) OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've never tasted anything like it. It's so unique and delicious. Definitely worth the 20 minute wait outside. Service: excellent. Doug (the owner and operator) is always there taking orders. He doesn't rush his customers. He answers all questions. He jokes around and he helps us get the order correct (he doesn't jip or trick you). He encouraged us to just share drinks, since it doesn't make sense to get one drink per person. He could have easily made us order more fries, but he helpfully suggested that we go with only one - he claims he doesn't believe in portion control and therefore gives a lot more fries than one person can eat. The duck fat fries (served only on Fri and Sat) aren't all that spectacular. But if you've never tried it. Def try it here. Drinks: They have unique bottled sodas. Try the Green River - a 7-up/Sprite type of drink, but made of pure Sugar Cane AND no caffeine or artificial flavoring. If you go, BRING CASH ONLY. They don't accept anything else. DECOR: Funny. All things playful and hot douggy is all over the wall. I actually enjoy the Yellow, Blue, Red hot dog-esque colors. My kind of place with my kind of humor. It's hard to explain in this brief review...just go check it out yourself. If you go there, message me and get me a Foie Gras dog!"
846,"Definitely worth the wait. Duck sausage with foie gras is amazing...and have been impressed with anything I have ordered off the menu. Staff is extremely friendly...Doug is always there to take your order! If you stop by on a Saturday, plan to wait 1+ hours outside...I have had good luck stopping by after 2pm during the week, and the wait is only 15 min."
847,Great selection of different specialty hot dogs... I had a pork sausage style dog with sweet mustard and cherry goat cheese. Amazing. I also tried the duck fat fries which were great. Limited hours which stinks... we had to wait in line a good 30 - 45 minutes (20 of which were outside in the cold). Friendly service and great price. The don't serve alcohol... would have loved a cold beer to wash down my hot dog!
848,"Its incredible, amazing, marvelous, stupendous, fantastic, charismatic, unique, enjoyable, and fun."
849,"This place has over 2000 reviews and a 4.5 rating so it's very unlikely that my review will have an impact. With that said, I felt like I had to review it anyway. I tell everyone I know going to Chicago to visit this place and due to the fact that it's a bit outside of downtown, I often am met with resistance. Those folks simply do not understand the brilliance of ""encased meats"". If I can offer you any advice, it's to try anything. At Hot Doug's, I've tried Duck+Foie Gras, Bacon+Elk, Crayfish+Pork, and RATTLESNAKE + Chardonnay. All of them have been amazing. If you're there on the weekend, get the duck fat fries because they're the best fries I've ever had. Worth the wait. Worth the hype. Hot Doug's is the best food experience in Chicago."
850,"The Chicago Dogs were the best thing on the menu. We each tried a gourmet dog, but we both agreed they were sub-par, especially given the price difference. Also they are big. It seemed that the regulars ordered one dog per person and some fries or tots. Definitely worth the wait though."
851,"Short wait on a weekday during lunch hour Plenty of free street parking. Cash only. Amazing Duck Sausage with foie gras. I loved the fries (regular ones, not the duck fat variety). Will come back."
852,"Really great hot dogs. Cool staff. I missed the duck fat fries since they only serve on the weekends, so that's what's holding up the last star. I really appreciated the strange dog concouctions and it was pretty nice in side. line was long but it was a breeze really. Definitely going to try the duck fat fries next time (can I get cheese on them too?)."
853,worth the wait
854,"I'm not a huge sausage fan but I had to see what the hype was about. I've been here twice in the past year and have loved everything I've tried! I happened to go at the right times and never had to wait more than 15 minutes in line. Doug himself is right there behind the counter taking your order, which is pretty cool. He's a nice guy! My most recent visit was last week and I tried: -The Mountain Man - I don't remember exactly what was on this but it was good! I had it last year as well. I like the mix of game meats in this sausage -Spicy Alligator- my favorite! This had cajun shrimp remoulade and goat cheese. This is also on this week's menu so if you go, get this! I can't remember what else I had in the past but I remember it being DELICIOUS. I love the unique combinations of sauces and cheese. Doug really knows how to pair them well with the meat. I also like the exotic meat they use. Where else can you have alligator or rattlesnake sausage? (If you do know of another place, do tell!)"
855,"You know you're a food snob when you find yourself microwaving ketchup at home to eat with your leftover fries. Wow, be prepared to wait. Freezing weather deters no one. 1 1/2 hour wait on a late Saturday afternoon. Their ""normal"" sausages are 2 or 3 bucks, their specialty ones more like 7 or 8 bucks. Since you can get a normal dog anywhere, I'd recommend getting something exotic here. Anything from alligator to rattlesnake to elk to yak to kangaroo etc (weekly specials rotate when they run out every week or two or three). So what to get? I'd rec the Foie gras with duck sausage, which is amazing. The yak was also fantastic, had a nice beefy flavor, makes sense since after all, it's a long-haired bovine found throughout the Himalayan region of south Central Asia (courtesy Wikipedia). The rattlesnake was also really good, somewhat sweeter flavor w less of a meaty flavor. Honestly, I'd just ask the owner what roughly you want (beefy, juicy, smoky, gamey, strange) and he'll help rec one or two. French fries were natural cut, great. Cheese fries would be excessive as there's a good amount of cheese on many of the specialty hot dogs. Cash only. Closed Sunday and closes at 4pm. For more details, check out my food blog at, wait, at here on Yelp. Come on Yelp, gimme some IPO shares!!"
856,"nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. go here. you will be 100% happy you did. expect a line out the door most of the time, so bring a friend or two to keep you company."
857,"I love big, saucy sausages! Hot Doug's and I started our affair exactly a year ago. I came on MLK Day and I am happy to announce that the sausage emporium only gets better with age. It was a gorgeous 45 degrees and the wait was maybe 45 minutes, too. Raul B. helped me pass the time in the line and we ended up splitting a large Cheese Fry, which I washed down with my Birch Bark Beer. I still can't wait to try Duck Fat Fries, but I have yet to return on a Friday or Saturday. That's OK, I've got Doug's encased meats to keep me satisfied when I do show up. This time I ordered the Merguez Lamb Sausage with Spicy Harissa and Haloumi Cheese. It wasn't extremely spicy, but it had a nice bite to it. I really enjoyed the cilantro sauce! Since not everyone is as willing to schlep from the burbs for ground lamb as I am, Joanne W. and I made a deal that I'd bring her back a dog if she picked up cupcakes for me. She requested the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, and I'm happy to report that from 1-9pm (after a drive then being put in the fridge and chilling in the car) it held up better than a Dolly Parton facelift. No soggy buns here!"
858,"2030 reviews can't be wrong. We made the mistake of coming here during lunchtime and had to wait about 40 minutes but it was well worth it. Just like I had seen on tv and heard from other people, the food here was everything I expected. I honestly thought with their popularity that they would charge more but the prices were fairly reasonable. I like that. I'm just really sad that we came here on a Thursday and didn't get to try the duck fat fries. Sadddddd."
859,Over 2000 reviews and I am doing an update? Well I just have to tell someone about the smoked knockwurst special sausage I had. It was the best sausage I have ever had. Doug also added a 4 cheese Mayo and fried onions rings sprinkles. Every bit was pure heaven. I would hope he makes this one a regular on his menu.
860,Can't ask for more out of a Chicago hotdog joint.
861,"Alright Mr. Doug... after attempting to visit your establishment on at least 2 occasions and walking away frustrated at the ever growing line, I finally had a chance to visit you. Damn you for being so popular (1,960 reviews at the time of this writing)! I rather enjoyed the random hot dog and sausage paraphernalia (including the little Brewer mascots) and got a real kick out of the names for your hot dogs (one formerly known as the Britney Spears sticks out in my mind). While I did not get to try your duck fries (a victim of coming here on a weekday), the overall experience was 5-stars. Your regular fries were awesome (which makes me yearn for those duck fat fries even more...!) and the sport peppers were nice and juicy. Overall, I'm still a Portillo's fan when it comes to the dog itself, but your grilled option makes the 5-star review stick. Keep doing what you're doing, although I wouldn't mind if you expanded the store and started accepting credit cards. I guess it goes to show you, if you have a great product and people love you, you get to do whatever the hell you want."
862,"I'm pretty sure that no matter what time of the day you show up here your going to be facing a line that is far out the door. Don't be deterred, it is worth the wait and the line moves fast. When I went the line came out the door, turned the corner and went all along the side of the building and then another length of equal distance. I was ordering within 30 minutes. I went here as a vegetarian and was all set to get their veggie dog, but when I saw the wild game menu I broke-veg hardcore. I got one veggie dog to try it out, but then I also got a wild boar sausage and some fries. Everything was delicious! The wild boar was perfectly seasoned, garlicy, peppery, and oh so meaty. The veggie dog was also delicious and made me feel kinda guilty for breaking-veg. If your vegetarian this place will still satisfy your deep down desires for hotdogs. Get it with the works! Fast efficient service + good prices + a delicious and ever-changing menu = The best hotdog place I have ever been too (including Pinks and Oki Dog in Hollywood, and Papaya Dogs in NYC)."
863,"Hot Doug's is oh so totally worth it. My boy and I stood outside in the freezing Chicago weather (the day before the temperature jumped up to the 70s) for about 40 minutes. We braved the line that bizarrely snaked around the shady (freezing) side of the building. We waited in the first lobby by the entrance. We waited in the second inner lobby. We waited in the line to the cash register to order, and by god, did Doug seem like a heavenly avatar of bounteous sausages by the time we reached him! We split one order of duck fat fries and four sausages between us: the foie gras dog, the weekly game special which was wild boar w/ marsala, the brigitte bardot (andouille) which was not spicy enough, but still a classic, and linguica. I could not stop moaning from actual food-induced pleasure. I don't know whether this level of happiness was induced solely by the food. After all, I was finally inside the warm cozy restaurant. I was also finally eating after the 5 hour flight, 2 hour ride to our AirBnB apartment, 7 hours of sleep, half hour of travel and 40 minute wait. Hot damn though, those sausages were fucking amazing. The fries were great, however, the sausages were really the most amazing things I feel like I've ever eaten (in terms of Western food). Hot Doug's is the BEST. Oh my god, and the prices are so reasonable too!!!!"
864,"Like most people I waited a good 2 hours in the middle of Feb for this place. My friends think I'm crazy, but would I do it again? YES X 100!!! This place is the most unique hot dog stand/place I've every been to. I came here with a few friends and tried almost everything. The fries are amazing!! So make sure you come on the weekends or else you won't get to try their duck fat fries. Doug is the cashier and he's super nice. The place feels very much like a local hot dog stand no different then a Mr. Greeks or something like that. Great place! I can't wait to come back here."
865,"Made sure to stop by Hot Doug's during my first visit to Chicago! It was Thursday morning at 10:30am and guess who was at Hot Doug's...? Everyone! I waited for about an hour but it was delicious! I made the mistake of going by myself -- so I couldn't finish everything (duck fat fries, duck sausage w/ fois gras and chicago dog). The Dog (Chicago style hot dog) was my favorite. And for only $3?! What a deal! Cash only! Friendly service but expect to wait."
866,"I was too busy enjoying my delicious $1.50 corn dog to write a review earlier, but here it goes. CASH ONLY! Street parking only (not much parking during lunch time) and $3.00 a dog fries are additional $3.00 (fries fried with duck fat additional) Saturday/Sunday only (cheese additional) Seating is available ONLY once you've put in your order (also limited) My boyfriend is a hot dog man, so we'll be popping in and out. 1 star down because I've never paid $3.00 for a dog that didn't come with fries"
867,"get a load of the weenies here at hot doug's. man, i haven't had a hot dog in over two years. and i miss them, i really do. i used to eat at crif dog's and grey's papaya in manhattan all of the time, and ever since i became vegetarian, hot dog's are a lunch that i truly regret not being able to eat every now and then. so when my brother suggested going to hot doug's after he picked me up at o'hare, i was pleased as hell to see that they have a meatless dog on the menu. he assured me after waiting on line for almost an hour that the food inside would be worth it, and he was right. i got a the veggie dog chicago style and it tasted fantastic. i'm not sure if it was because the bun was so loaded with extras that i couldn't really tell it was a meatless hot dog, but who cares. it tasted amazing. the fries were good too. they also sell Tab in a can here. in case you felt like drinking a Tab in the can. or, right here is fine.* my parents had fries made in duck fat. i was repulsed by this, but they scarfed that shit down like nobody's business so i guess it's safe to say it tasted good. it was pretty inexpensive, it tasted divine, and they had really cool decor. i am proud to say that my brother's band had an 45"" EP hanging on the wall along with a picture fo sid vicious eating a hot dog. that made me a proud little sister. *did anyone get my European Vacation reference?"
868,"Such long a long line, at any time of the day the place is open, is an indication of how great this place is. I've been here a couple of times, and you seriously cannot go wrong with any of the food options. We've tried the boar and rabbit, both were tasty. The fries complement the meal. I go for the cheese fries every time. The guy taking orders is the nicest guy. Everyone working there is top notch. Even though the wait is long, it surprisingly doesn't take very long for your order to come out once you place it. Definitely stop here if you're a Chicago visitor, and be sure not to miss it if you're from Chicago."
869,This was worth the one hour wait to receive my antelope sausage. Doug is such a nice guy! and the buns where steamed to perfection which complemented my sausage very well!! I want to come back just for a taste of a Chicago dog!! See you soon!!
870,Chicago Style dog - 5 stars Merguez Sausage - 4 stars (the cold cheese cubes did not have the texture i was looking for with the sausage and harissa) Duck fat fries - 5 stars Overall vibe - 5 stars Wait - 4 stars I would definitely go back again and again if i had time...i would like to try all of the dogs and doug is a totaly down to earth guy who runs a tight ship thanks yelp for helping me find the perfect lunch spot on a quick 1 day visit
871,there is nothing i can say that hasn't already been said. Incredible hot dogs. amazing service. fun/funky decor. all around perfect grub atmoshpere. I LOVE IT HERE.
872,"Before coming to Chicago, my friends put Hot Doug's on the top of the list of things to try. However, upon arriving to the city the odds were definitely not in our favor. The universe simply did not want us to experience a Chicago dog. On Friday, we made plans to try Hot Doug's for dinner only to discover that it closes at 4pm on our journey over. On Saturday, another attempt was made for lunch but our lack of knowledge of public transportation caused us to be late. On Sunday, we woke up early to make it on time to find out it does not open Sundays. Finally, on Monday we started our adventure at noon to get to Hot Doug's. My friend's map on her iPhone does not like us and led us to a location that was about 30 minutes away from Hot Doug's. We couldn't hop back on the bus because our one day pass expired and we didn't have any cash. We had to walk about a mile to the nearest CVS to purchase a bus pass. From there, we had to walk another mile to the correct bus stop. It was now 3pm. We finally arrive at Hot Doug's around 3:30pm. Hallelujah!! The line was long and we spent our time deciding that we would each get two hot dogs after our three day journey to get to Hot Doug's. Ten minutes before closing, we finally make it to the front of the line.... to find out it was cash only. We had about $20 between the three of us so we sadly agreed to split two hot dogs between three empty stomachs. After ordering, Doug (I'm assuming) noticed our disappointment and we explained to him our mishaps. He says ""How do you not have cash?!!! Unless you're Californians, you should always have cash!"" WE ARE CALIFORNIANS. He laughed at the coincidence and told us to order whatever we wanted and he would only charge us $20. Needless to say, it was the most delicious hot dogs I've ever had. The Foie Gras was definitely my favorite and I highly recommend it for all you duck lovers out there!"
873,"Hot Dog Heaven... this humble place is one of my absolute favorite spots in Chicago AND in the country. Before ever coming here, I was never a huge hot dog person... but after my first visit here during one my many trips to the Chi, my view on hot dogs changed forever. I always have to get a Foie Gras dog, or two... every dog is absolutely awesome, but none quite measure up to this one. What's great about this place is that the menu is always changing, but everything is always delicious. It's no wonder that this place remains a Chicago favorite and extremely popular with a line out the door day-in and day-out. The staff is great and Doug, himself, takes your order. Inexpensive and amazing... definitely a must-go spot for all foodies and out-of-towners. Among my friends I'm the foodie that travels a lot for work and whenever I'm asked where to eat in Chicago, Hot Doug's is always the first place I suggest. I can't wait til my next trip to the Windy City, just so I can come here."
874,"A trip to Chi Town without the infamous Chicago Dog is injustice. Rave reviews from Anthony Bourdain, Zimmerman, and local food critics pointed me to Hot Doug's. An ever changing menu of dozen or more varieties of Dogs and Duck Fries; how could one go wrong? Unbeknownst to me the week we traveled to Chicago, Chi Town was hit with a heat wave with sweltering unimaginable hot temperatures. However, I wasn't to be deterred by 100 degree temperatures. Since we were staying on Michigan Mile, it was a bit of trek to check out Hot Doug's. I decided to stop by after my lunch at Sabri Nihari on Devon Avenue (both on North West side). Now all of us were already carbed out with our Indian/Pakistani luncheon. My son (such a trooper) shared my enthusiasm for Hot Doug's. We reached Hot Doug's a bit after 3 pm in our cab. To my surprise, there was still a long line out the small shop. Did I make the right call? Should we wait in this heat? Well, after all we were already there. Why not? The wait in line gave us the time to decide from the multitude of choices facing us. I had to make my decision wisely since only 2 of us were willing to taste and share. I ordered the classic Chicago Dog and the glutton in me picked Foie gras and Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, and some Fries. (Note the Duck Fat Fries are only made on the weekends). Incidentally it is a cash-only counter. One bite of my Foie Gras and Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli; I was literally in decadent hog heaven. Yes!! It was absolutely worth it. And my snooty ass will withstand any long line for another bite, any time. I wish I had the appetite to try their other game concoctions, but there is always the next time. A well deserved iconic addition to the Chicago Culinary scene; Hot Doug's is a MUST for all foodies and lovers of encased meats."
875,"Chicago has always been famous for their hot dogs and Hot Doug's does it well. It's a staple in Chicago and an institution in the hot dog realm. Los Angeles has their Pink's, New York has Crif Dogs, and Chicago has Hot Doug's. Alligator, ostrich, duck... I heard about the wild flavors at Hot Doug's but never did I imagine they would have rattlesnake! I'm not so adventurous that I would order the rattlesnake on my own but my friend did along with the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. Talk about rich, sinful, and out of this world snack food. The texture of the rattlesnake meat was very soft. Good thing it had the casing to keep it all together. The foie gras hot dog was heavy. I couldn't imagine one person eating it all by him/herself. It's best cut up and distributed amongst the table. The foie gras on top was shaped in coin slivers. The heat of the hot dog did begin to melt it and only then did the hot dog really come together. The Fleur de Sel helped bring out the flavors. These two hot dogs were not my favorite but in terms of something different and a bang for your buck, these were it. A high end restaurant could do these hot dogs and charge an arm and a leg for them. I had the brown ale chipotle buffalo sausage, bacon garlic mayo and carragaline farmhouse cheese dog. It was great. Lots of the hot dogs come with some sort of mustard infused sauce. I am not a mustard fan but the sauces are really good and I do like the variety of cheeses they use. They definitely don't skimp on their ingredients. For classics sake, we got a Dave Pound (corndog) and a Classic Chicago dog. What a deal. For about $2 you can indulge in what I call nostalgic bliss and a piece of Chicago. The Chicago dog comes with whichever toppings you want- tomatoes, pickles, mustard, etc. Good luck stuffing it in your mouth. We also got the weekend duck fat fries. I wasn't too impressed with them. They were just regular fries but one serving is plenty for four people. We actually got two fries. Too much but best believe we packed all that food away. Guilty pleasures! Hot Doug's is a fun stop in the suburbs of Chicago. The line is knee deep. We got there half an hour before they were open and were in the first batch but any later and you could be waiting 2 hours or so. The people come in droves. The jackalope head on the wall is kitschy and oh what a burn to celebrities their hot dog names are. Hot Doug's names their hot dogs after celebrities but once the 15 minutes of fame is up the dogs are renamed. Hot dogs may be referred to as ""formerly Anna Kendrick"" but Hot Doug's is forever. There is only one Hot Doug's."
876,"I dragged my whole family to Doug's on a 95 degree day. The line was well around the building but fortunately we were in the shade for most of the wait. The menu is pretty impressive with various meats (dogs and sausages), cooking methods, toppings and specials. My son and I each had the Fanny Valette (a special with Chicken Chorizo, Mole a la Carlos and Queso Asadero). I also had a Chicago Style Dog with everything plus peppers. My wife had the Blueberry and Merlot Venison Sausage with Blackberry Mustard and Smoked Gouda Cheese. And we ordered cheese fries and regular fries. The dogs/sausages were outstanding. Very creative and flavorful. The fries were very good, especially the cheese fries, and the portions were very generous. We spent about $40 on 4/5 people (one of my daughters just picked on fries) and we left quite full. The wait was pretty brutal and while I wouldn't do it in that heat again, it was worth it. Doug knows dogs!"
877,"There is no shortage of fine dining restaurants in the windy city, but a true Chicago culinary trip will never be complete without a taste of the famous hot dog. Hot Doug's needs no introduction for those living in Chicago. Even when we arrived at opening time, the wait was at least an hour long during the bitter cold winter. The line can be two hours long during the warmer months. The average of 4 1/2 stars rating with almost two thousands reviews should tell you something. Love the unusual meat selections and flavor combinations. Think pomegranate puree with sheep's milk cheese. Where else can you find snake or alligator sausages in your hot dog? The special menu changes on a regular basis, so don't expect to find that elk sausage the next time. I recommend people to try the foie gras and duck sausage. My only disappointment was the duck fat fries. Not crazy about them without the crunch."
878,"First of all, my hubby has Never stood in line for something as simple as a hot dog, I on the other hand have spent time keeping the sidewalk warm at Pinks. lol. Hot Dougs was closed the week of July 4th, but opened on Friday. Carlos and I had explored the city while on vacation with a vengeance by the time we were ready to hit O'Hare on Saturday afternoon. The last thing were had time to do was Stand in line for the Greatest encased Meat I have Ever eat ten! Our plane left @ 5 pm, we held up the brick wall for 1 hour before we were face to face with the Jackalope. Too cute! While we were waiting, one of the guys took pity on us and let the kids play in the hose and the adults fill up water bottles, it was a bit toasty outside. Doug, the Boss, could not have been nicer or funnier. He was a bit flustered I believe, b/c there was a local food critic and his family in house. We ordered our lunch, Carlos had the Selma Hayac and I had the foie gras duck dog. I am 44 yo and had never had foie gras before. oooohhhhh yummo! I might have been nervous about the flight but my tummy was a Very happy camper:) We had an order of duck fries, they were good, I Really wanted and did try to taste a difference with regular fries, sadly, I tasted no difference.:( Glad I gave them a shot anyway. Carlos and I always share our meals, his sausage had Actual meat in it! AMAZING!, and HOT just like the name of the dog. The place is small and cozy. Love the paint job too! They even have lawn art, 2 lil old pink piggy's that show map parts of the hog. Wish I had had time to eat other dogs, like Rattlesnake. Swear! LOL Great way to end a Fabulous vacation!! Thanks Doug for the Best line in town!"
879,"If you go, expect a line, normally a pretty long line. The line is there because this place is the bomb. However, it is the best line I've every waited in. First, because it has really colorful and interesting people to talk to who are also super hyped about eating at Hot Doug's and second, because you know that at the end of the line is the best Encased Meat Emporium in the nation! Fois Gras dog is the best, but the $2 Chicago Dog is just as good. This place isn't just incredible food, but a chance to experience Chicago neighborhood culture at it's best. Go on Friday and Saturday for Duck Fat Fries nirvana. Put this place on your culinary Bucket List!"
880,"This place deserves a five. There's just some sort of vibe that this place gives whenever I go. The anticipation of eating here builds as you're forced to wait in line. And when you finally do get to order and eat, you're not let down. I've been in this line during hot summer days, beautiful spring and fall days, and one really cold winter day. Yes, the wait sucked, but it was worth it. It's weird how that works. Some notes... I highly recommend that you get an order of the duck fat fries AND the regular fries. The difference is subtle and you won't appreciate it without a reference. Doug himself is going to take your order at the counter. Yeah that's him. I've never seen him upset or be unfriendly to a patron. He's just been a happy go lucky guy whenever I go. Check the website before you go. The place does close on occasion for the holidays and for vacations. The place is usually closed around the same dates every year though. You may think you won't get a seat. But you will. I know, you feel like you're back in the lunch cafeteria at school as you gaze across the full tables and strange faces. But it'll work out. You may end up sharing a big table with some other people, but that's not such a bad thing. You will probably have the ultimate ice breaker with you, duck fat fries... Share some, and make some new friends over encased meats."
881,There's a definite reason why the line for this place is typically out the door. I've been here a couple of time and Doug's has consistently delivered the goods. Here's the '411'... - Spicy Thai Chicken: peanut sauce is a bit overpowering but still a tasty dog - Smoked shrimp and pork: definitely a show stopper - The dog: a classic done RIGHT! My friend and I split the spicy thai and the smoked shrimp along with a small fry. Everything was top notch. There are free refills on soda and plenty of hot dog memorabilia to stare at so what are you waiting for???
882,"Hot Dougs is legendary because of the high quality encased meats, the service, and the wait to get it. Hot Dougs offers daily specials of rare meats such as kangaroo, yak, rattlesnake, or rabbit, most of which I have eaten before with great interest and satisfaction. The safe menu (chicago dog, corn dog, brat) is really inexpensive and delicious. I can say without hesitation that Hot Doug's offers the best corn dog anywhere for $1.50. Doug himself mans the register each and every day, and is always willing to take part in silly banter while you order. He truly loves his business and it shows. I'm pretty sure if you get a readily visible Hot Dougs tattoo you and your guest will receive free meals as long as you don't abuse it. Not enough for me to get one but I hope it is for someone reading this."
883,"I thought Hot Doug's was a real treat on my last visit to the Windy City... worth the hour it took us to get there from our hotel in the loop. I'm already quite the hot dog fan... but HD's take hot dogs to a whole new level! This semi hole in the wall joint, you wait in line to order at the counter. Unfortunately, there is no menu posted outside for you to peruse while you wait. And if you didn't already know, Chicago could be described as somewhat cold in the winter. Better bundle up while you wait! I got the foie gras dog after reading my fellow Yelpers recs. And the SO got something like garlic pork dog with fruit chutney and manchego (or something scrumptious like that!) Nom Nom Nom! Both were equally delicious! I will say I was pretty jazzed about the duck fat fries... however, they didn't taste any different to me than any other fries. I'm probably gonna be thrown off the Sears Tower for saying that! The place is a bit hectic, so don't go there if you're not in the mood to stand in line, or if you're looking for ambiance, or if you don't want to feel a little rushed! I really wish Doug would get his rear and his sausage down to Dallas stat!"
884,"This is what I call an athlete's splurge on cheat day (apart from Edzo's in Evanston). Been going here for years. Have pretty much tried everything on the menu from the regular italian suasage-esque and hot dog bites to the gourmet tastes of such exotic meats as alligator sausage, duck sausage, ham sausage. Cheddar fries are addicting. As are the duck fat fries. The latter I have not had in a while because weekends when they serve them, the outside lines are way too long, especially when the temperature hits single digits. Every time I have guests and friends from out of town, this is the first place I take them as part of my Chicago VIP tour. I also think this place can be a natural anti-depressant..literally. Last year when my car was booted, I walked 5 long blocks from DMV after paying in blood to get my car back and had to wait 8 hours to get it unbooted in freezing weather and feeling very challenged lets say. Walked over to Hot Dougs, and after a great meal of duck sausage with some who knows how to pronounce sauce and toppings and cheddar fries, I was high as kite and Mr. Happy go lucky! Plus Doug is always on standby and behind the cashier to throw some humor your way..if you ask the right questions. This place should be a city landmark!"
885,"Why it gotta' be this way? A great place should be busy with the people but why's it got to be busy with the hipsta nation? I hope it was just my visit and the crowd is more diverse than the action I ran into. Well, the dogs were so good and diverse I sorta' wished I could stomach more than two, sorta' wished i could have come back for rounds two and three. YEAH! That good! Result: I am a big fan!"
886,"Doug is some sort of strange sausage wizard. He is the Gandalf of hot dogs. I've never seen so much innovation in the realm of encased meats. Because I love to wake up early and punish myself, I ended up taking a cab from the loop to Hot Doug's and was lucky enough to be first in line. After I sat down to wait for my food, a nice man who works for the establishment interviewed me about how and why I ended up there. He gave me a coupon which I used to purchase my 3rd helping of encased meat(therefore stuffing my gourd way more than needed). So, word to the wise - if you are first in line, you might get some free stuff. Anyhow, I was a little disappointed by the foie gras and duck sausage. The foie gras mousse on top was overwhelmingly thick(which I expected) but apart from being extraordinarily rich, I didn't feel it had much flavor. I cannot say the same about the rattlesnake sausage, which really impressed me. There's something about deadly animal meat that makes it all the more succulent. It was topped with something I can't remember but it was kinda sweet and all delicious. I also had a shrimp sausage of some sort and it was really good. Honestly, the damn menu here changes so much that it is probably pointless to look at reviews for specific suggestions. It is best to just head out yourself and wing it."
887,"After a night of stuffing myself full of chicago style deep dish pizza, I decided to have a light lunch at Hot Doug's. Being from California, I am an absolute wuss when it comes to the cold. I guess the other people in line could hear my teeth chatter when they reassuringly told me that the wait was worth it. For all our sakes, I hoped so. 1 hour and 20-odd minutes later: Finally entered zion and it was warm. It was a saturday and they were serving french fries cooked in duck fat. it goes without saying, but i ordered that along with a turducken dog. the guy at the counter was really chill when taking my order. i could tell he was definitely relaxed in his environment. not saying he was lazy or complacent. he was...chill the fries and hot dog were both very very good. anyways, in sum: long wait, chill service, good food. you'll walk out feeling like a champ. a glutinous champ."
888,"Hot diggity, dog ziggity, boooooooom. I heard about Hot Doug's long before my arrival in Chicago. I was also warned about the ridiculously long wait to enter into an eatery where people were shuffling in and out like cattle. The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage's reputation precedes itself. This frankfurter is so rich that after one bite you will think you're Bill Gates. After waiting 1.5 hours, many in my group decided to get a second sausage just so the wait would be ""worth it."" For my second entree I got the Norm Crosby, a brat made of beef, pork and garlic. This was just humdrum. The duck fat fries are good but I've had better elsewhere. You get a basketful, so share it with a couple of buddies. Would I wait that long again? I would wait about 60 minutes for the Hot Doug's wieners. If one second ticks pass that, you'll hear me complaining like a little school boy."
889,Kind of the place everyone wants to go to cause everyone says its great so then it must be great or else anthony bourdains and half the city wouldn't wait in line to eat a hot dog from a place that accepts cash. Worth the experience...but maybe not worth the wait. Still four stars cause I'm man enough to say I could be wrong.....it's just not all that.
890,"I have no issue waiting over an hour for a derishuz meal - but my parents do. Good thing they're very good natured (& that there were 3 very rowdy and slightly tipsy Giants fans providing entertainment behind us!). We patiently waited just under an hour in the 16 degree Chicago weather for some famous Hot Doug's! (We did get here smack in the middle of lunch time so try to get here a little early. Coming right before they close doesn't seem like a good idea bc the line will just build up). Their seating system actually makes a LOT of sense. You can't go in and reserve a table before you order. Miraculously the minute after you order with Doug (he's friggen awesomesauce btdubs), a table will open up for you! Mind blown. We ordered 3 items off the special menu & a Chicago dog. Got the foie gras duck sausage (obvs), the pesto sun dried tomato pork sausage, and then one who's name escapes me. We also had an order of duck fat fries (only available on Fri & Sat). TBH I don't exactly recall what anything tastes like because I was legit ravenous after my long trek over here from NYC, but I do recall being pleasantly happy afterwards :) P.S. Agua is freeeee!"
891,"I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could. Excellent variety of unique offerings. My dog was awesome. I had the duck fat fries, and I couldn't tell the difference. But good fries nonetheless. Doug was at the register. Very friendly. Once I ordered, the food came out quickly. The hour plus wait...not so cool."
892,"A great experience for any hot dog fan. The variety of options is the main draw. From buffalo dogs to Foie Gras-topped duck dogs, all of which are tasty and satisfying."
893,"I don't think I have ever had anything so decadent in my mouth as the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. Homemade duck sausage. Check Gads of fois gras. Check Truffle Aoili. Check Firm spongy bun. Check Get in my mouth. Check 2 seconds of inhaling the hot dog voraciously. Check Memories of Doug's and drooling. Check From the time that I got into line until that amazing hot dog in my belly, I felt like I had finally learned to appreciate what a good hot dog will do. Everyone was so passionate and friendly about their little institution. I say institution because it's a shrine to da'dog. Go, experience, eat."
894,"As the 1900th review, there is at once high standards for and very little need in writing a review articulating all the reasons that Hot Doug's is a big fuckin' deal. My friend and I walked into Hot Dougs, a beacon of comfort and culinary joy after an extensive trek through public transportation + a mile long walk through the blustery Chicago winter. Since this was a Tuesday at 3PM in a snowstorm, there was no wait (phew). We shared large fries and five hot dogs between the two of us, which led to immense stomach pain and lethargy but zero regrets. I doubt you can go wrong with any of the specials. It's BYOB, and all of the people who work there are really (almost suspiciously) friendly."
895,"I've only been to Hot Doug's once, but once is enough to give it 5 stars. If I were in the city more, I would go every time. Yes, the lines are long but the wait is worth it. I went with a group and we shared everything, and it was very good. Definitely a place you have to go to. Especially if you're only visiting Chicago."
896,"Well the service was very very nice. Hot Doug's offers a nice warm welcome and takes your order with care. The dog was.....well....SKINNY. I actually get more out of a dog at Cosco when they offer the thick Vienna dogs. BUT, the dog was good, nice fluffy steamed bun, and fries were skinny too. Friendly place and I think the friendly-ness is the big feature here. Dog's are good, just not what I consider to be the best. Line moves fast - so don't let that deter you, just give it a try ya might just love it!"
897,"Best hot dog I've ever eaten. I had the duck with foie and the Chicago dog. Both excellent. The duck fat fries were amazing. My wife had the Santa Fe chicken, I tried that as well. So good. We went to frank and dawgs a Few days later and it doesn't compare. Can't wait to go back to Chicago and eat there again."
898,"So cold. So so cold. I thought the fact that it was 20 degrees out would make the line shorter, but we still stood there for 45 minutes in the cold cold air. I wondered what kind of encased meats would make people do such a thing, and so I ordered two sausages to find out. First was the classic duck confit pork sausage. It had peach aioli, morbier cheese and truffle oil, and I've never had any of those things before. I'm glad my first time was at Hot Doug's, because everything went together perfectly: the softness of the cheese complemented the snap of the sausage while the truffle oil and peach aioli added just the right amount of earthy sweetness. Probably the best sausage I've ever had. Next was a Chicago Style hot dog, to see how Hot Doug did it. It was presented beautifully, and the flavors were all classic. It felt like there was an extra dash of celery salt and a little something in the mustard or celery that added just a bit of tang to the whole thing. Overall a supremely good hot dog. I can die happy."
899,"The ultimate for all things hot dogs and encased meats. If you want the best hot dogs Chicago (or any place for that matter) has to offer, look no further. I ordered the Paul Kelly, The Elvis, and Duck Fat fries. All were delicious and worth the wait. I wanted to try the specials, but they were a bit pricey - my friends tried it and thought it was worth every penny though. Service was really friendly and the place was really crowded, so find a seat quickly after you order. Come early, bring cash, and enjoy!"
900,"Worth the wait.....hell, worth flying to from Florida just for lunch! The wait wasn't bad although I only waited 45 mins. Doug was a very nice guy, you really feel welcome. I got the Ginger spiked Rabbit sausage with pumpkin creme fraiche and goat cheese. All quality ingredients, and the first bite pops with flavor. I've never had anything better. The duck sausage with foi gras was AMAZING. I left feeling that my Chicago trip was complete, not to mentioned inspired to grind my recently shot wild boar and put it in tube form once I got back home! Cheers, to Doug BTW great for kids, and the duck fat fries are only available 1-2 days out of the week, Saturday being one. (delicious)"
901,"Oh yes we did! Walked straight here after our lunch at Kuma's Corner. Hey, you only live once right ;) We ordered a bunch of little dougies to-go and to be honest, a year later and I can only remember one - the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with a truffle aiol. YUMM the others are good, but this is the wiener. Tip: Duck fat fries are only available Fridays and Saturdays :tear:"
902,"My first five star review! I just visited Hot Doug's for the first time this past Monday with my son, who is home for the holidays from the Air Force Academy. What a great experience. We did have to wait for about 45 minutes in line, outside and down the street, but I think it was all part of the experience. I had the foie gras hot dog with the black truffle mayo, something like that, it was great. I also had a crayfish and pork sausage, which was just okay. My son had the daily wild game sausage, which was wonderful; he also had another daily special with cheese stuffed peppers chipolte and pecans etc., it was great! We did have an order of fries that we split, they were good, but want to come back for the duck fat fries! Another day..."
903,"The hotdog meat here is better than other places but I prefer the bun at Frank and Dawg's. Overall great place to eat, good sevice, and friendly atmosphere. There's always a line but it moves along quickly."
904,"Was this place worth waiting outside in the frigid Chicago weather for 45 minutes until we finally get to order worth it...YOU BET YOUR ASS IT WAS!! Divya M and I were visiting our friends at Kellogg and we thought this would be the perfect Saturday breakfast/lunch. I refrain from calling it brunch because I usually consider eggs a necessity for the term ""brunch"". Our friend Ben S. drove us, so I can't be of help in terms of how easy this place is to get too without a car. It's cash only by the way, so come prepared. We obviously got the duck fat fries and they were outstanding! For the hot dogs, I got the foie gras hot dog, the rattlesnake hot dog (game of the week) and the Spicy hot dog (named after an actress that I am forgetting the name off). Hands down the spicy hot dog was the best. The rattlesnake hot dog was right up there and so was the foie gras dog, but the spicy hot dog was the clear cut winner. The foie gras dog is rich and delicious, but I would recommend splitting it because by the end it's a bit too much. The rattlesnake dog was amazing and although I am not sure if I was actually eating rattlesnake, I like to think I was...and I loved it! The service here also needs to be mentioned. Doug is the nicest guy and very excited about the hot dogs you are choosing. The busers are extremely friendly and they are the ones who bring you the food, so you should be nice to them as well. Lastly, we ordered hot dogs to go (when placing our original order) and Doug just told us to let him know 5 minutes before we were leaving (we ate inside) so he could make sure the order was hot. Seriously, I hope this place is here forever...I am thinking of making more trips to Chicago to just eat their hot dogs...not to visit my friends, but to eat at Hot Dougs!! Sorry Ben!"
905,"The dogs/sausages are really top-notch - as far as encased meats go, of course... but the thing that really puts Hot Doug's over the top is Doug, himself. He's a genuinely nice guy. He's always friendly and he doesn't turn people away if they're in line by closing time - even when that line is down the block."
906,"If you want a hot dog dont go here. Their hot dogs suck and they are known for their sausage not hot dogs. The sausage is worth trying if you like different kinds of sausage, if your into good ol fashion Italian sausage this is not the place for you. The duck fat fries taste like salty fresh cut fries from any real good hot dog stand so their good but they taste the same as anywhere else. The line is insanely long, their hours suck, and they put unmelted cubes of cheese on your sausage. I know a lot of people love this place but Im sorry, its awful. Frank Campeglia (The Food Club)"
907,"What I love most about Hot Doug's is that they do things their way. Do they need more space? Yes. Could they speed things up a bit? Yes. Could they have longer hours? Yes. Is their menu a bit confusing? for me yes. But keep in mind you are entering into the mind of a genius and your opinion does not matter. Slow down and enjoy your longer lunch break, because it does not get much better than Hot Doug's. His inventiveness reigns supreme in the hot dog world.

908,"Now I had pretty unrealistically high expectations for this place as all these Yelp reviews really hyped this place up. I was just way too excited for my own good about going to this place. Well, believe it or not, this place met, no EXCEEDED, my expectations. How is that even possible? No clue. I mean I really love sausage more than the average person (I blame my German heritage for that) but these are the best sausages I have ever had. When I went I ordered the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri, Crispy Fried Onions and Carrigaline Farmhouse Cheese and I ordered this Portuguese linguica sausage with some kind of smoky cheese on top. The ribeye steak sausage was very good but the Portuguese linguica sausage. OH. MY. GOD. I need a new paragraph just to describe this sausage. I'm not sure if it was the sausage itself that was so good or the combination of it with that smoky cheese but this was seriously the best encased meat meal I have ever experienced. I dream of this sausage. And Hot Doug's has now become my benchmark for all things sausage-related. I also tried the duck fat fries and thought they tasted like nothing special. Someone I was with bought the normal fries so we could compare and, yes, you can taste a difference but nothing substantial. I would recommend just getting sausages and no fries. Save room for the good stuff! As far as the wait goes, we got there at 10:45am on a Friday and only had to wait about a 10 minutes wait which I know is unusual. I've driven by this place on the weekend and seen the line stretch for blocks. I can't wait to go back - these sausages are worth a 2 hour wait in the Chicago winter."
909,"Ordered the foie gras and duck sausage dog. Was it as good as everyone says? In this world of hungry children and failing economies and corrupt governors, did this specialty dog warrant the $9 price tag, the commute, and the lines? Hm... I don't know... I don't think so. Firstly, I will say it's very very good. It was definitely duck flavored and good combination of flavors and I don't regret at all coming here and trying it once. However here were a few thoughts I couldn't help thinking: 1. Was this the best hotdog I ever had? Maybe but I can't say for sure because this is a unique specialty dog. So it didn't really fix my traditional hotdog crave nor did it fix my foie gras crave (I like mine grilled). 2. Was it worth $9 and perhaps a wait? It was definitely worth $7 and a short wait. And definitely $5 (I am dreaming obviously) and an hour wait (at that price I would order 2 for sure). 3. It's hard for me to give any place 5 stars that didn't blow my mind, or affordable enough for me to visit regularly. 4. Hm, smaller than I imagined... (that's what she said) Take friends and family? Sure. Try at least once? Totally. Regular spot? I don't think so. Still, very very very good."
910,"What she said. And duck fat fries. In the words of the ever so poignant Cherish, ""Do it to it"""
911,"Oh yes, Hot Doug's is the best. Their fries are unbeatable, the sausages are unique and too good for words. When eating the delicacies, my boyfriend and I usually don't say anything, except ""Oh my God."" and ""What is this?????"" It's that good."
912,"Innovative and creative dogs. I got the rosemary and garlic one and added grilled onions to it. Maybe it's just me, but I felt like the flavors weren't executed well and tasted a little too sour/tangy for my liking. Maybe I should've ordered the classic instead. =/ On the plus side, I did enjoy the snap of the casing when biting into it though. Tip: Cash only."
913,Best hot dogs I've ever had. The foi gras hot dog was unbelievable
914,"A true Chicago icon. I've been here a handful of times. Each experience has been roughly the same: Wait in line for an hour. Order cheesy fries and a hot dog or two. Pay in CASH only. Take a deep breath and pray that the weird sausages that you ordered will be delicious. Bite in! I would have to say that I've loved about half the specialty dogs that I've gotten and been nauseated by an equal number. The foie gras dog was great. Their regular hot dogs are great. I've had a bunch other that I adored. Then there were some of the game-y ones. I'm a midwesterner that has eaten her fair share of game. There are also only two items of food that I've ever eaten in my life that I really despise: my mother's ham and parsley casserole, and shitake mushrooms. (I say this to demonstrate that I am a good eater and usually can find a way to like everything that I shove in my mouth). However, I think it was a goat sausage that I had once here, with an incredibly stinky brie or similar cheese, and a hot-pink prickly pear jelly that just about made both me and my dining companion gag. It was terrifying! Stinky cheese, super sweet jam, extremely gamey goat... Not my cup of tea. This has happened a few other times; I try to be adventurous and end up regretting it. Which makes me a little less encouraged about spending an hour waiting in line to come here the next time."
915,"Arrived at Hot Dougs on a Saturday morning at 10am. The place opens at 10:30 and there was already a line being formed. My girlfriend gives me a look, you know that look, the ""we're seriously going to wait 45 minutes for a hot dog?"" look. The line was about 2 hours long by the time Hot Dougs opened at 10:30. We were a little bit behind where the red bricks started and it took us about 45 minutes to get to the counter. 15 minutes into the wait, rain. Fuck. My girlfriend gives me that other look, you know, the ""this better be the best meal you'll ever have in your life or I'm going to remind you about this for the rest of our relationship until it eventually breaks us a part 2 months later"" look. We finally got into the restaurant, right before it started heavily pouring. One thing that really surprised me, there were dudes still waiting outside. There was still a long line. People must really like these hot dogs. And it was very fortunately for my relationship that these hot dogs were the best damn dogs I've ever eaten. Foie Gras dog - The heaviest, tastiest thing I don't think I can ever eat again for the sake of my health. Shitake dog - My favorite. FOrgot what exactly was in there, but it was a damn good dog. The duck fat fries are also a must have. Just a different taste to it. Delicious. I definitely recommend showing up way early, because I don't think I would have had the same great experience if I had to wait 2+ hours for this. Then again, I don't think I would enjoy anything except for splash mountain at disneyland if it was a 2+ hour wait."
916,"aka ""The Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium"" If you're ever in Chicago, this place is worth checking out :) We tried - The Black and Bleu (dark beer and blue cheese pork sausage with Guinness stout mustard and garlic-cheddar cheese spread) and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (with truffle aioli and foie gras mousse). So fattening but so good! They also have cheese fries and duck fat fries! I couldn't really tell the difference between duck fat fries and ordinary fries though - although I think my arteries would have begged to differ :P Note: If you want to get the duck fat fries, they only have them on Friday and Saturday"
917,"If you were a tortured soul and were looking for the meaning of life, a poet, a philosopher, a hopeless cubs fan, a chip on the shoulder sox fan, a tourist, an adventurer, a theologian, a scientist, all of your quests end with the road to Hot Doug's. There aren't enough stars in the sky that can fit the rating scale. Hot Dougs. Words CANNOT describe this place hence the nonsensical opening. I don't love this place, I am in love with this place. Hot Doug's is a ritual and a rite of passage anyone and everyone who lives in this city needs to perform. If you have an unrefined palate like mine and go to fine restaurants and wonder why you can't tell why other people like the food so much more than you, this is the place that will bring resurgence to your confidence of saying you can tell good food apart. I want to die eating a hot doug's dog. Do not be the person who later laments about all the years you could be eating here. This is a request, a plea, a call to action, to all fellow humans, go to their web page and look at their daily specials and forget any other place in this city or the world that thinks they know what they are doing with food. Let Doug show you why he is the Michael Jordan of cooking. (Sorry this will be the one review I will not talk about any of the food there or the wait or the setup. I am going to get up right now and go to Hot Doug's. The place has turned my brain to mush... In a utopian world everyone would have had a chance to have eaten at Hot Doug's)"
918,"This place is amazing. Thank you yelpers for suggesting the foie gras. My sister and I spent the week visiting Chicago and somehow lucked out on about everything we did, and one of our bits of luckiness was not a single person in line at 11 AM. We walked right up and were treated with good customer service even when my crazy sister wanted ketchup."
919,"Best hot dogs I've ever had!!! If you are in Chicago you need to go and experience a hot dog here. I took a 30 min train ride, a 30 min bus ride, waited in line in the rain for 40 min. I would do it all over again just for 1 more hot dog."
920,"Hot Dougs takes me to my happy place every time. They have fascinating sausage creations for the adventurous eater, including game meat sausages and all kinds of crazy toppings. For the safer eater, they have classic dogs, such as the Chicago dog, corn dogs, and Polish/Italian sausage. The classic and crazy sausages are all delicious, I usually go for the crazy sausages. The owner, Doug, runs the cash register, he's super friendly. Duck fat fries? Delicious! They don't need any salt or ketchup, perfect as they are. They're only available Fridays and Saturdays, of course, when lines are the longest. I recommend Hot Dougs during a day off from work, otherwise the line is just too long. Thank you for being a Chicago staple!"
921,"We came on a Saturday afternoon -- no line? Yes! On closer inspection, they were closed due to flooding. Because they are closed on Sundays, it meant my supposed life-changing experience with Hot Doug's will have to to be delayed until Monday. We come back on Monday and the line looped around the corner, with an estimated 45 minute wait. Given the fact that I waited 2 days and 45 minutes (not including travel time away from the Loop), expectations were high. And Hot Doug's did not disappoint and did change my taste buds for hot dogs forever. The Foie Gras Hot Dog is delicious. The creaminess from the Foie Gras and the fattiness from the hot dog, marries extremely well. I expect Foie Gras from now on --- on all of my hot dogs."
922,"If youre gonna have a chicago real deal dog, you will have to trek on out to Hot Dougs! its way out there, and you will wait on a line(luckily it wasnt freezing cold this day) and they close at 4pm(that and far location prevented me from giving them 5 stars!) and if you go on the weekend you can get the fries cooked in duck fat, my heart skips every time i remind it! prices are great, dogs are even greater!"
923,"Great prices, great dog variety, awesome fries...basically kicks ass. Did the chicago, foie gras, and a pate dog...all were pretty dang good. Pate one had some crazy unique Mediterranean-like flavors from that butter. Only thing that sucks is the hour and a half line...Why do you have to close so early (4 pm) and closed on Sundays?...they would be ba jillionaires if they were 24 hours."
924,"I'm in lust with Hot Dougs. Its never a fail no matter how long I have to wait in line and it only gets better, now that I know you can BYOB! First I will say if you don't want to wait in line go early or late because the lunch rush will take a good 30 mins of your time. On a Friday or Saturday you can almost 100% guarantee an hour wait but again its well worth it especially for some of those delish duck fries they only offer on the weekends. The menu staples are all amazing, my fave being the firedog; The Anna Kendrick (formerly the Keira Knightley, the Jennifer Garner and the Britney Spears) I've tried a lot of the specialty dogs which change weekly but always get a default firedog as backup. Some favorite specialties I can remember are the Kangaroo sausage and the Rattlesnake sausage. Oh and don't forget a cheese fry to complete your order! The staff is great and I love the punk rock atmosphere and wiener decor. No trip to Chicago is complete without a stop (or 2) to hot Dougs!"
925,"For meat-eaters this place is king. And if you're a vegetarian -- like myself-- this place is just eh well I could make this myself... I ordered the Joe Strummer Dog. Basically, a Chicago Style with a veggie dog. The dog was plain, probably a Tofu pup or Yves branded and it was loaded with a fresh pickle, relish, onions and tomatoes. Considering this place is all about the gourmet, a Toffutti branded vegan sausage would have been legit. Grill that up a little and vegetarians would have a lot more to talk about. Not that this place is catering towards people of my persuasion, but it makes the experience better when you're trying to oblige your meat eater friends. Everyone that works at Hot Doug's is great. Super friendly, relaxed atmosphere, so that makes up for the lackluster vegetarian fare. If you're going to get dragged here by your meat-eaters buddies, then I'd suggest trying to get the veggie dog mixed into something other than the Joe Strummer. See if they can put some cheese, sauce or something other than the usual on it."
926,"I am late to the game on this one, but better late than never, right? FINALLY I made the time to try some of the delicious pieces of heaven sold at Hot Doug's. Between 2 of us, we ordered 4 sausages and an order of duck fat fries. A little gluttonous, but how can you blame us! It was way too hard to choose! Every single one was DELICIOUS. Everything about it - sausage was perfectly prepared and cooked, the toppings/meat ratio was perfect, the bun is impressively soft and the fries were sneakily amazing too! I want so badly to go back, but it is such an investment of time. It is only open for lunch and there is always a line on weekends so I doubt that will happen anytime soon since we are approaching hibernation season. However, if I am home on a weekday anytime I am definitely making my way over there! BEWARE - check the website before you go. I tried to go awhile back with a friend of mine and it was CLOSED! They close anytime the owner is not there and apparently announce when they are closed on the website."
927,"*5 stars for a fast food joint* After hearing about Hot Doug's forever, a friend and I decided to go on a Friday that we had off. As we walked up, there were about 8 guys already in line ~20 minutes before opening. Our wait went by fairly quickly, and we were soon inside...to wait yet again, but this time to order. There's quite a few choices on the menu! What I got: The Cheesy Atomic: Spicy jack cheese, stuffed pork sausage with spicy passion fruit mayo and habanero jack cheese. My favorite - great flavor, and the right amount of heat from the various peppers thrown in the cheese and mayo. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage: with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (fancy salt). I found the foie gras on the duck sausage to be there more for texture than flavor, and the sausage itself was fairly bland. That's to be expected for duck I suppose, given my past experience with duck sausage. I think this would greatly benefit if Doug were to saute the foie gras a bit to warm it up. Norm Crosby: a hot dog with beef, pork, and garlic, served Chicago style. Didn't really notice much of a difference between this and a normal hot dog given all of the condiments thrown on top. Duck Fat Fries: only served on Fridays & Saturdays. Delicious. Spectacular! Some of the best fries I've had. Overall, I'm happy with the food I got at Hot Doug's, and I know my friend is in love with the place and keeps going back any chance he gets. I don't think it was utterly amazing...but it's a fast food place. That said, Hot Doug's is one of the top choices in the city for your favorite fast food/junk food, which is why I give it 5 stars for a fast food joint. I think it's worth a wait - but not the 2+hrs some people have been waiting. If you want to go, get there early on a weekday and (preferably Friday to get your hands on some duck fat fries) and chow down!"
928,"Fun yum! The honey and I dragged my dad to Hot Doug's, and even he (the old-fashioned foodie curmudgeon that he is) loved it! We tried the foie gras duck sausage, the swiss cheese stuffed pork and beef knockwurst (surprisingly, this was even more overwhelming and rich than the foie gras) and some large (unfortunately not duck fat) fries. All were delicious. I love that all of the encased meats seem to be made in-house. Price point for non-specials is excellent. ($2 for a Chicago dog!!) Mr. Hot Doug himself took our orders and he was patient, kind, and humble when the honey mentioned that we've been wanting to try Hot Doug's for a long time! I'm a fan. Go!"
929,"First time we went, the place just closed at 4pm, which was a bummer. BUT... we came back and it was TOTALLY WORTH IT! The cashier was very friendly and was fun to talk to. The Hot Dogs were worth the second trip back here. I had the original chicago dog. After the first bite, I didn't want it to end. It was that good! The only downsides are that its 1.) typically a long wait, 2.) only open until 4 and 3.) the CTA buses don't seem to go from the Blue line to Hot Dougs for some reason. But other than that its worth the wait!"
930,"So this was my first visit to Hot Doug's. I came on cold Fri morning around 10:45am and was in line what seemed like forever! Actually I got to order my Hot Dog (The Mountain Man Sausage (A Damn Tasty Combination of Elk, Antelope, Buffalo and Venison) with Pomegranate-Fig Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Rambol Cheese)) and the Duck Fat Fries (only served on Fri & Sat.) by 1145am. Overall, I thought the Mountain Man Hot Dog was very good and it was not too gamey in flavor, which I personally don't like. The addition on the Pomegranate-Fig Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Rambol Cheese gave the hot dog a sweet and mild spicy flavor. The Duck Fat Fries were very well fried and crispy and were solid fries overall. But nothing really special about them. Eat them with a cheese dip (upon request, its free), which really complimented with the duck fat used to fry the fries, lol. I would have given 5/5 stars, if they served beer or wine, but they don't. I did beer and wine while I was in line. So maybe this place is a BYOB? Did I mention Doug the owner took my order, really friendly guy and they play a very eclectic selection of music ranging from 80s rock to old Brazilian Bossa Nova:D"
931,"After living in the flat state of Illinois for 4 years and failing to have a decent Chicago dog, I have finally come here. Walk in to a warm and small hot dog place that is served by friendly and funny people. Order what you want, pay half of what you expect to pay for a popular place, and enjoy the food. They really love and trust their customers here with free refills and condiments all lined up for you to use and take to your table as you please. Love? Love. The buns are perfect. Not too dry and strong enough to hold the dog. The dogs really vary. I love the names of them too. If you're new, stick to the traditional dog. It will be clean, and taste like what you THINK a hot dog should actually taste. Thank you, Hot Dougs, for not being crowded at 3 pm. Yes, go at an off time. If you don't know by now, that's the trick. If you want to go somewhere that is popular, go during an off time. Foodies... You should know that."
932,"On my third visit to Chicago, I finally checked off this place on my to-eat list! It took an hour of commute and almost an hour wait, but the encased meat do not disappoint! Being a foie gras fans, of coz I ordered the foie gras duck sausage. I love its creamy texture and some how the rich and bold flavor of the duck sausage reminds of Chinese sausages. To my surprise, I like the blue cheese and pork sausage even more. It's soooooo juicy I wanted to get another one without the bun :)"
933,"When it comes to Hot Doug's, I'm gonna be like the postman. Neither rain nor sleet nor freezing temps will deter me from my goal. And no matter the weather, it's worth the wait! We visited on a cold, windy February Saturday and even though we got in line 15 minutes after it opened, it was still an hour wait. And did I mention it was cold? But once we got inside the doors and the delicious odor hit our nose holes, all I can say is Wow. The encased meats (as they prefer to be called) range in price from about $3-4 for the ""standard"" fare to 8-10 for their weekly specials. And while the original Chicago Style dog (with everything of course) is top notch, the money is in the specials. As the name weekly specials implies, the specials change weekly. But no matter what is on the list, I'd suggest focusing on those. You'll have a little time to browse the menu once you wait in line inside the restaurant, but it's not a bad idea to prepare by checking out the menu online. Keep an eye out for the game of the week under the jackalope. While there, my group of friends sampled rattlesnake, yak, jalapeo duck, kangaroo, and their 40-sausage chili. The chili was rich and meaty with a great smoky taste. Highly recommended. Each special sausage has it's distinct characteristics and it's hard to go wrong with any of them. They were all good, but the favorite of all the types we got was the rattlesnake. As an added bonus, on Fridays and Saturdays, they serve their famous Duck Fat fries. These were great tasting, but came out a bit limp and I would've preferred them a crispier. But still good enough to get them again. The order is big enough to share between a few people. Service-wise, Doug is great as well as the rest of the staff. They're welcoming, helpful, and all really seem to enjoy working there."
934,"Doug is basically the coolest guy you'll ever meet. Or should I say (encased) meat? Whenever I go, the line is maybe 10-15 people deep. Then again, I don't go around 3 pm when there is only an hour left and it's the after work rush crowd. I suggest getting to Hot Doug's around 11, 12ish. No big wait. Also, BONUS: The menu is online. If you end up having to wait in the crazy line (which moves fairly fast, really) you can just pull the menu up on your smart phone and pick out what you want. Super easy, and worth the wait. Seriously. ALWAYS GET ONE OF THE SPECIALS! For realsies, the Portuguese Linguica is to die for, the yak sausage is awesome, the Foie dog is amazing, anything Doug does with bacon, pork, garlic, rosemary, and cheese is always an A+. Plus you get a chance to taste meats you might not have had before. Any game of the week is awesome. Rattlesnake, kangaroo, and the buffalo/elk/antelope/venison mix? YEAH SO GOOD."
935,"11:50am on Monday. Easy free parking right out front. No line. Perfect I've been here several times before and this isn't normal. My Paul Kelly and the Thuringer were absolutely tasty. As I was leaving, there was the typical line."
936,"Everyone in Chicago loves Hot Doug's. The food is always stellar. Always. I have been there countless times. If you are a Hot Dougs novice, you may drive up and see that incredibly long line out front and think, ""Oh I can wait, it must be worth it"". Look. The hot dogs are worth the wait. They really are. But seriously, don't wait. If you are smart you can drive by every now and then and sometimes there won't be a line. Go then. Because then you can sit down and enjoy your gourmet hot dog. When there's a line halfway down the block, and you finally get in there, there won't be anywhere to sit. So you end up standing around in an incredibly packed room like a jack-a**, staring at people sitting and eating, hoping someone will get up. But they won't. And your food will get cold. And then it won't really be an awesome, memorable, truly great Hot Doug's experience. Take my advice. You don't know me, but believe me. I wouldn't lie to you. Don't wait in that crazy line. Drive by every few weeks and eventually you will time it right and get lucky and you'll thank me."
937,Real hot dog deal. Prepare to wait in line for at least 15 minutes during a weekdays. Chicago dog was fantastic and don't forget to ask for raw onions.
938,"You know amazingly enough, growing up I wasn't really a big fan of sausages or hot dogs. Then a decade ago I had a REAL sausage from a butcher shop and my entire opinion changed. Actually, now I love a good hot dog and/or sausage. When a friend of mine came to visit, we decided to try and get into Hot Doug's. We have seen it on a few TV shows and written up a few places, so luckily we knew to arrive kind of early. It was a Friday too, so luckily the line wasn't as long as on say, oh a Saturday. Waited outside for maybe 30-35 minutes before giving my order to the man himself, Doug. I ordered a Foie Gras Dog, a standard Chicago Dog, and a Kiera Knightly. I joked with Doug for awhile that I'd order ketchup on my Foie Gras Dog. He was a good sport, and no I would never think about doing that. Anyway, I really don't remember what my friend ordered to be honest with you, but that doesn't even matter, because we got duck fat fries too. The Foie Gras Dog had a very, very healthy (uh, but not really because Foie Gras is terrible for you) portion on top for only $9. I bet there was $20 worth of Foie on here so what a great deal! The dog itself was good, but I was not expecting it to be as rich as it was. All in all it was good, not ""I am having an epiphany amazing,"" but yeah I would get it again. The standard Chicago Dog was also good, but nothing amazing and the same for the Kiera Knightly. The fries were really good, but they did not taste as good as they cooled down. Eat them fast! Still good cold though. The other dogs do look awesome, and everytime I've tried to get back to Hot Doug's, the line has been extremely long and I've been hung over. A good combination? No. I'm not going to wait in line for 90 minutes hung over. 4 stars for now, until I go back and have more. It was really good, but didn't blow me away. I recommend it too. I would say to come early, but if I do, everyone is going to come early. So come early, and maybe not on a Friday or Saturday. Hmm, but then again, you wouldn't be able to have those great duck fat fries would you?"
939,"On our recent trip, we waited two hours to eat at Hot Doug's. Knowing that you are going to wait in line ahead of time helps. It's part of the experience and is pretty much inevitable. Either accept it or move on. Is it worth it? Hell yeah. Where else are you going to get sausages like these? Nowhere. In my opinion, it's a must do at least once when in Chicago. Once you get inside, you will be helped by Doug himself who is very cool. And when you get inside, it will make sense as to why he has you wait outside for so long. It's not very big inside. So the good news is once you're in and you've ordered, there's always a place for you to sit and you get your food in about 5-10 minutes. There's a method to his madness. Personally, my focus is on the specials. I'm sure everything on the regular menu is great but what sets this place apart are the crazy concoctions he dreams up. We had: 1. Saucisse de Toulouse with Dijon Goat Butter, Pate de Campagne and Creme de Brie Cheese. Amazing! Our favorite of the day. 2. Taco pork sausage with green chili mayo and queso asadero. My boyfriend did not like it but I did. It wasn't as original as some of the other selections but it was quite tasty. I did have to take off some of the cheese though. 3. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. This was the boyfriend's pick and he really liked it although he preferred #1. We also had the duck fat fries and this might be totally sacrilegious to say but I don't get their notoriety. Neither does my boyfriend. They taste a little better than regular fries but they did not make the earth move or the sun shine a little brighter or even make me swoon a little. So next time I'm in town I might hit up Hot Doug's when they are not available and maybe wait 15 minutes less in line. Personally, I didn't find it difficult to get here by public transportation. We took the blue line to California and then took the 52 bus which drops you off right in front. Given that the bus drivers in Chicago think they are starring in their own private version of Speed, we got there in like 10 minutes from the train station. There isn't much else around here though which is a bummer unless you count Kuma's Corner. And if you can eat at both in one outing, you need to be calling Adam Richman."
940,"Wow! My hubs asked me if I wanted lunch while we were in the City. Hmmm, lunch in the City or back to the burbs? Yeah, I want a City lunch. We agreed on Hot Doug's. The line was not too terrible, the rain kinda sucked, but when in Rome...... I ordered a chicken sausage sante fe style with duck fat fries. Yum! My husband had whatever came with fried plantains. Wow - plantains really do make everything better. Soda has unlimited refills. Thanks! I liked that there was enough seating. The counter guy was great, all servers were polite, helpful and professional."
941,"Please don't hurt me! Yes, yes I am giving Hot Doug's three stars - because really, I'm not quite a fan. I'm not leaping for the chance to go back again or to tell all of my friends to come here. It's good food, but I think the experience is a 'try it once' type of thing. A friend from out of town came in and they have a car (score!) so we decided to come on a Saturday morning - a little before they opened. We waited about an hour or more in line, but it was a nice day and we got to catch up. We knew we'd be waiting awhile... but finally we arrived inside! I decided to go with a normal hot dog and a specialty, plus duck fat fries. We sat outside in the alley on the side since they have outdoor seating. Don't get me wrong, the food is great. But I think it's more of an ordeal than it's worth to enjoy the tasty hot dogs. Besides being extremely far from my place (I feel like you need a car) and the extremely long line, I might have had too high of expectations. Maybe I just don't really like hot dogs? Maybe it's because my friend was hungover from the previous evening and couldn't really eat the food? Either way, I'm not running back again - but go if you have half a day to spare in the city."
942,"Omg the gourmet hot dogs at this place were delicious. I got the duck sausage with foie gras and truffle aioli and it was really amazing! My friend got the linguica, which I got a small bite of, and it was cooked perfectly and tastes just like the linguica I usually eat for breakfast back at home in Hawaii. Fries were cooked crispier than that of In n Out, though at the same thickness, which I think is pretty tasty. If I were to compare this place to Wurstkuche in LA, though, I would have to downgrade it 4 stars, for both experience and taste for the money spent. I spent $9 at this place in Chicago, but at Wurstkuche, I can get a gourmet hot dog with a house-made bun and a clean dining atmosphere with the long tables and beer on the menu to order, like at Octoberfest in Germany. Here, the buns seem to be the generic grocery store kind, and the really tiny establishment allowed about 8 fast-food style tables worth of people, who are forced to inhale all the smoke that the hot dogs emit when being grilled/fried/etc. Friendly service, though."
943,"My lawdy, I am glad that my blogger friend told me to go here. The line was quite long on a Saturday morning even though we had just gotten there about 20 minutes after they had opened for the day. I believe we waited in line about an hour in the cold windiness before we could even get to the menu. I snagged a picture of the random pig they had outside and the menus they had inside. Talk about crazy! There were normal hot dogs with sausages you'd think of such as hot dog, andouille, chicken sausage, etc but then there were the ""specials"" which had a wide range from rabbit to elk to buffalo to rattlesnake. Feeling adventurous (and also because I had waited so long), I opted for the most decadent one. So my first was the regular ""The Dog"" which was Chicago-style complete with Kosher pickle, carmelized onions, tomatoes, lots of mustard, poppy seed bun, celery salt, and NEON relish. I mean, look at the picture! It was bright green and kind of awkward. I know I pictured it first but it was actually the last hot dog I tried so I didn't finish it. To be honest, nothing remarkable seeing as the sausage itself was fairly normal; I felt that all the toppings were overbearing but hey, gotta eat the Chicago way! My friend got the Chardonnay and jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with roasted pepper aioli and Pere Joseph cheese. Wow. The aioli and cheese paired so perfectly with that rattlesnake meat. It was like a bite into the Southwest with the spicy kick from the sauce and the juiciness of the rattlesnake sausage. My order was to opt for the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (sea salt...basically). It was the creamiest, most awesome hot dog I've ever had. Even my friend who has never tasted those ingredients before thought it was the best he'd ever had. I mean, I love all of those flavors but who would've thought to stick it on a bun as encased meat and top it off so lovingly with foie gras rounds. The fleur de sel curbed the overly savory-sweet but light creaminess of the foie gras mousse on top while the heavy truffle aioli pulled us away into a different kind of heaven than the gamier duck meat. I loved licking my lips after every bite to get the most truffle flavor out of my experience. Best. Hot Dog. Ever. Completely worth the wait, especially with the nice touch of having bottled gourmet sodas (had a birch beer) and an atmosphere completely fitting with a hot dog culture. Fantastic. Lastly, I made sure to come here on the Saturday I was here because they had their duck fat fries (Friday and Saturday only). Some pretty heavy fries, those. I liked them a lot but definitely had to throw in the towel after so much food. Also, if you're going to pig out like me, make sure to bring lots of cash with you because they only take the green paper here!"
944,"Drove in for a daytrip in Chicago, found this place on yelp, and it was a great find. The Sal Tessio was good but the foie gras dog simply blew my mind. It makes me want to go hunt for duck liver. A must have. I tried the duck fat fries as well, which really just tasted like normal fries to me, fries are fries. Be prepared for a gigantic line and arctic like winds, but once you finally get to the end and doug himself greets you, it will all be worth it. p.s doug is ok, not that hot, no matter what my girlfriend says p.p.s ok doug i suppose you are a charmer"
945,"I could go on all day about this place. I come here about once a month. Great food, and the nicest staff I have ever come across at any business. They treat everyone exactly the same, and I believe that they really are happy to see their customers when they come in. This place is world famous, and after you eat here, you will know why."
946,"Not sure why this place has so much hype & such a long line. It's good, but it's also just a hotdog...i didn't think it tasted any more spectacular than any other specialized hot dog joint. Not worth standing in line for 30-45 minutes (random Monday). Ordered 2 hotdogs for myself (1 special & 1 regular chicago-style dog): 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($9): 2 stars. This sounded good...so good that almost the entire group ordered this as one of the two dogs to eat. I was not a fan, & neither was the rest of my group. It was way too rich (& I normally like rich). But I felt like it wasn't that flavorful..just creamy, fatty, & slightly bland. 2) Chicago-Style Hot Dog ($2): 4 stars. I liked this $2 dog better than my $9 special dog. I had it with ""everything"" topping & dog deep fried & grilled. ""Simple"", yet flavorful & tasty...can't really go wrong w/ your typical dog. 3) Had a bite of my friend's rattlesnake dog (daily special)...ok this ""dog"" was AMAZING (5 stars for this one). It was topped with dried fried onions & was bursting w/ flavor. I couldn't tell it was rattlesnake over any other meat, b/c it tasted just like any other hot dog, but it was the toppings and sauces that made the delish flavor. ORDER this if it's available. Sides: Unfortunately, no duck-fat fries on week days. We ordered an order of regular fries to share. They were good, but nothing special. Just your typical thick-cut steak fries."
947,"This yelp page is basically pointless because it's a bunch of people jerking off about how good these sausages are. Grab the lotion, because it's that fucking good. It is really fucking hard to get here by public transportation, but I would commit otherwise people will make fun of you for not having gone to this place when you had the chance. Expect to wait another hour or so in line because of all the other asshole yelpers that show up from the moment it opens to the moment it closes. We got the Uber Garlic Pork sausage and the Sauternes Duck Sausage. Both were stellar. I'm not a huge sausage fan, but these changed my mind. They're decadent in a way fried meat is not supposed to be. Doug is the fucking man."
948,"I have never been so mistreated or been spoken to so rudely as my trip to this overrated eatery. The confrontational and utterly bothered staff were clearly annoyed that I arrived near their 4pm cutoff. Upon getting our food, it was clearly a rushed effort and of course the hot dog tasted as such. I would say this is soo not worth the wait and overrated at best. Stay away."
949,"Came here on a Friday morning at 11am, about 15min wait. A few minutes later, the line was already at the end of the block. Awesome buffalo sausage, foie gras sausage and rabbit. Always go for the specials, a tip I heard from a regular. French fries fried in duck fat was great too but not too distinct. Leftover was still great after 5 hrs. You'll encounter idiots smoking in line, friends letting friends cut in front of them and just the daily annoying stuff. Also you cannot save your table until after you order, so if you have a big party, you can forget sitting inside or together. Do not go here if you have to be somewhere in 2hrs. Staff are very friendly and accommodating...patience, patience, patience. You come for the experience.."
950,"After living in Chicago for almost seven years, I finally finally made it to Hot Doug's. I think I am rating it five stars just because it is just as good as everyone says! I went with three other friends. I would suggest going with this many people because it means you can try more different types! We ordered the following: Duck sausage and foie gras - my fav! they really are generous with the foie gras and if that is not rich enough, they top it off with a little creamy sauce...YUM! Smoked crayfish and pork sausage - I know it doesn't sound that good, but this was suprisingly delicious! It was my second fav, it comes topped with a generous topping of goat cheese, and the combination of flavors will wow you!! I was actually least excited to try this one, and it turned out being one of the best ones!! Smoked Portuguese Linguica - a little spicy, comes with some yummy sauce, you can't go wrong with this one either if you are looking for a sausage with a spicy and different flavor Ginger spiked rabbit sausage - wasn't gamey at all, not sure if it is was because it was ginger spiked but it just tasted kinda weird to me, one bite was enough for this one. Chicken and spinach sausage - sounds boring but it was really good! Can't go wrong with this one either. And the polish and chili dogs were your run of the mill hot dogs, still tasty but definitely overshadowed by the other crazy flavors! And we got THREE orders of duck fat fries. Not sure if it was because I knew they were fried in duck fat but they seem extra good to me, slightly crispy on the outside, a little mushy on the inside. I even ate a lot of them without ketchup!"
951,"This place is soooo good. It is so out of the way, but it is worth the walk and bus ride. The hot dogs were smoked and grilled. The flavors of the bread and toppings were just perfect. If you wanna try some unique hot dogs and sausages this place is the place to go to. Froi Gras hot dog and spicy sausages ahhhh so yummy. I had four dogs and they were under 10 bucks sooo good. Italian, Polish, Chicago style, Spicy OMG so worth the walk."
952,"La has Pinks, DC has Ben's, Chicago has Doug's. To be fair I like Doug's better than either of the other two. The Chicago dogs are cheap and the fries are handy. You can get get gorged for less than $10. Yes the line makes you want to make like Wayne Brady and choke a bitch but you can't blame Doug's for being so lovable. That being said, I'm still a late night, post drink, bacon wrapped, dirty dog guy."
953,I'm not a fan of hot dogs but these were amazing. Loved every type I tried. Will definitely go back! FYI Cash only.
954,"Great food, the best bratwurst I have ever had. Its a very popular place though so don't be suprised to find a line. On saturdays the line is literally around the block. The owner makes the place what it is, he takes the orders and being super friendly talks up every customer. Makes you feel v welcome. There is nothing special about the restaurant, simple decor, tables and chairs. But the food (all kinds of sausages u can eat!) is worth every bite"
955,"If you're a travel channel junkie like myself, then you've probably see Chicago's very own, Hot Dougs, showcased on Hot Dog Paradise. Hot Dougs brings a new twist to the world of encased meats. Don't be fooled by the ""hole in the wall"" demeanor; this place will have you lining up around the corner. Literally. If you want to experience the hot dog heaven that is Hot Dougs, be sure you get there before they even open at 10:30 AM. They have a small window of operating hours, so it's best to get there as soon as you can. Either way, you'll be standing in line, but I promise, it's worth it. Make sure you bring cash though, they do not accept credit cards. Hot Dougs provides specialty sausages, game meat of the week, and regular good old fashioned hot dogs. I took a chance on a sun dried tomato stuffed pork sausage with pesto aioli and burrata cheese. My boyfriend decided to be more adventurous and went straight for the Chardonnay and Jalapeno Rattlesnake Sausage with Berry-Currant Mustard Cream and Trugole Cheese. Both, interesting and wonderful. The specialty dogs may be a bit pricey at $7-9 each, but you can always opt for a good old fashioned hot dog or sausage ranging from $2-4. Duck fat fries are only available Friday and Saturday, but their normal fresh cut fries are piping hot with potato-ey goodness. You'd would think that since Hot Dougs has such a great food reputation and long lines to back it up that the staff would be less than pleasant, but that's far from the case here. Doug himself will be there to greet you at the counter with a smile and friendly suggestions. You can tell he loves what he's doing and he loves sharing his ideas with his Chicagoans. The personality you see featured on food shows will be the same guy you meet in person. Hot Dougs is a Chicago gem and worth a wait in line. They are to encased meats what peanut butter is to jelly. They just work. So if you find yourself with a day off, get up early and head out to Hot Dougs. In fact if you're a Chicagoan, put this on your bucket list."
956,a bit overpriced but food is legit.
957,"My second visit to Hot Doug's was bliss! We got the Chicken & Ham Cordon Bleu sauage with Dijon-Shallot Butter, Fried Prosciutto, and Gruyere and the Bacon Jalapeno Duck Sausage, with Blood Orange Mustard, Smoked Blue Cheese and Honey drizzle, and duck fat fries. The Cordon Bleu dog might not sound as interesting as some of the options, but it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. The flavor was intense. Each juicy and crispy meat was showcased and it was smothered, but not subdued by melty gruyere. The Jalapeno Duck Sausage was dark, smoky and powerful, much like an excellent chili. We bit it with near-reverence, careful to portion a piece of creamy bleu cheese for each mouthful. Killer, killer food."
958,"Had port elk sausage. It was outstanding! I will definitely go back and try some of their other exotic concoctions. I think there are Chicago style franks like red hots, Vienna Beef and Superdawgs. And then there's places like Hot Dougs and Franks N' Dawgs which take dining on a bun to a whole new level. I can see why this place has a great reputation."
959,"This place is a gem. I'll start off by saying that I'm a vegan (health reasons, rather than philosophical) and I have fun food allergies (gluten, dairy, eggs, etc) that generally make eating at a place like Hot Dougs not so fun territory; the experience at Hot Dougs is so amazing, I'm willing to put my health on the back burner and let the alligator sausage, duck fat fries, and fontaine cheese fight it out for the rest of the day in my stomach. I had actually heard about this place place shortly after I moved to Chicago in 2004 and tried to go once in 2006, but they were closed (check the website before you go! They take a lot of vacation time.) I finally made it in 2009 and again in 2011 while visiting. Hot Dougs is not a place to go for a quick bite. This is the best bastardization of gourmet eating and americana fast food I've ever seen. As a result, Hot Dougs should generally be a planned trip, and the closer you come to opening, the better. Expect about a 45min - hour wait. Although there is some limited seating inside (which, miraculously, there always seems to be a seat available when I get there), there is also some outdoor seating around the corner. Word to the wise - don't sit down until you order. You will most likely be called out on it. The staff is friendly, even though pretty constantly busy. And the food. The food is amazing. As it's a pretty big deal for me to eat meat, I always choose from their special menu and explore the land of exotic meats. Fridays and Saturdays offer Duck Fat fries, and they're worth it. This place truly is an experience unto itself and the wait becomes part of it. Bring someone you need to catch up with and chow down after you've explored one another's deepest secrets in line!"
960,"I don't even know where to begin!! Not only I had the best hot dogs/sausages of my life here, it would not be an exaggeration if I said it was one of the best meals I've ever had! Waiting in a line that was going out and almost around the block for more than 45 minutes was absolutely worth it! We put a lot of thinking into which four from the amazing options to pick and one turned out to be more delicious after the other! I consider it almost a crime against humanity that they don't open other branches elsewhere! A must to check out when you're in Chicago! Just make sure you don't put any catchup on your hog dog, because Chicagoans don't take kindely of such!"
961,"Overrated. Sorry - these better be some goddamn amazing hot dogs as there were people waiting in line at 10:00 AM. They open at 10:30 AM. Chicago = cold. We got the foie gras dog, the Chicago dog, the Rib-eye dog, and some chicken sausage dog. We got fries. Man, I was not impressed by the foie gras dog - I thought it was going to be totally awesome and it was just a hot dog with some cold foie on top. I liked my Chicago dog a lot better. I thought the fries here were pretty awesome, though. Pretty freakin' awesome. I would've given this place three stars if it wasn't for how good the fries were and for how chill the workers were. Is it worth the line? Does it live up to the hype? Not in my book - but it seems like a cool touristy thing to do."
962,"I hate standing in line. Especially when I'm on vacation. Especially when I've taken public transit out to some godforsaken part of suburbia and walked what seems like a mile across some questionable sidewalks. But Hot Doug's was worth it. We were in line for about 45 minutes on a Friday just after opening time with a mix of people who knew what to expect and people like us who were unprepared for the magnitude of the thing. But eventually we turned the corner, eventually we saw the menu, eventually we reached the counter of Doug himself, who was just as happy to take our order for a foie gras dog, a chicago hot dog and some duck fat fries as he was to take the order of the two guys ahead of us who ordered something like twenty hot dogs and two sets for fries between the two of them. ""You can't under-order here"", they said, ""You'd have to get back in line."" As promised, we found a seat easily, and the food came out quickly. They are working as fast as they can back there, and standing around in line to order is preferable to standing around waiting for your food or looking for a table. ""Trust us, this works"", say the signs. The place is like a museum to encased meats - all sorts of interesting things line the walls, serious or not. Oh? The food? I'm supposed to comment on the food, huh? The hot dogs were excellent. Fresh, well prepared, and above all - well flavored. Doug knows what he's doing and will not steer you wrong. I thought the duck fat fries were excellent as well, though my companion, who is not really a fan of fries, didn't see what all the fuss was about. Like I said. Hate lines. Hate wasting time when on vacation. But this was worth it. Best hot dog of our visit to Chicago by far."
963,Doug is very nice. The place is a bit out of the way and the wait is decent if you get there before it opens. The Duck Fat Fries were heaven and plentiful while the sausages (I had the bratwurst and Foie Gras) were a bit too rich for my taste. Definitely a place thats worth visiting at least once if you're in the area though.
964,"Came here during lunch and I was in luck-- the wait was only about half an hour long! There are a ton of specialty hot dogs to choose from. In fact, it was a bit overwhelming. So, once I got to the counter, I just asked the worker to suggest 2 hot dogs to order based on the things I wanted (1 spicy and 1 chicken). Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the hot dogs I tried but they were so freaking good. Note, I really wanted to try the duck fat fries but they are only offered on Friday and Saturday :( I did try the cheese fries and they were still very yummy. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm definitely coming here again! These hot dogs are to die for!"
965,First place I take bands when they come through town..Its a Chicago staple...
966,Finally went this saturday around 11am and waited for an hour or so. Totally worth it but then when I got the foi gras hot dog...It was so small. My bf and I also ordered the duck fat fries... yummy. Overall the food was delicious but I was not full in the end.
967,"Chi-Town, I kinda like you! Hot Doug's is SOOOOO good. like, SOOOO good! I'll tell you a story to illustrate just how good it is. We went last Saturday when the heat wave first hit Chicago. It was probably like... 95+ degrees out and people were waiting for over 2 hours in the sweltering heat. During our wait, one poor guy in line passed out from heat exhaustion and hit his head on the sidewalk! The ambulance came, of course, to make sure he was okay, and when he woke up, the first thing out of his mouth was, ""did i lose my place in line?"" Mmhmm. That is how good it is. We ordered: 1. BLT: bacon sausage with avocado puree, lettuce and tomato 2. Thai chicken sausage: chicken sausage topped with seaweed salad, sriacha mayo (freakin' delicious), and duck cracklings. We weren't sure what the duck cracklings thing was but we assumed maybe duck skin fried and chopped up into little bits? 3. Pecan-roasted beef and pork sausage: with block cheese and.... something else. 4. French fries fried in duck fat. Only served fridays and saturdays The pecan-roasted hot dog... *sigh* it is my love. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I visit Chicago for a rendezvous with this thing. P.S. Fainting guy, if you are reading this, your dedication to good food inspires me."
968,"This place is amazing. The wait is well worth it. I had my sister and brother-in-law in town this weekend and they loved this place. Duck-fat french fries were amazing. We went shortly after they opened for the day, just before lunch on a Friday, and waited a half hour or so - not too bad from the lines I've seen before."
969,"This place blows me away every time I go. I've never waited less than 40 minutes and I never care. Further, Doug is unbelievably nice. Talk about a people person. The last thing any establishment needs after 99.9% of their clientele is waiting outside in line for a minimum of 40 minutes is an a$$hole with a poor attitude greeting you from behind a counter. An a$$hole Doug is not. In fact, his entire staff is nothing but friendly. Everyone is willing to answer questions and help you out. The food, oy, the food...just...I mean...there really are no words. One of the most creative menus in existence, in my opinion, can be found at Hot Doug's. Yes, there are your standards chardogs and corn dogs, etc, but the ""specials'...man, they are special. Some personal past favorites of mine include (but are not limited to) the: -Apple and Cinnamon Pork Sausage with Curry-Honey Mustard and Brie-Blue Cheese -Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Goat Cheese -Curry Pork Sausage with Curry Mayonnaise and Smoked Blue Cheese drizzled with honey and last but (certainly) not least -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie-Gras Mousse, and Fleur de Sel. Also, they have Duck Fat French Fries on Fridays and Saturdays. $3.50 and you get a ton. Seriously**, 2,000 pounds. So, go. Be prepared...no, be EXCITED to wait. The anticipation makes it even better. **Not seriously - but you do get a lot. OH! I almost forgot. One thing that always impresses me with the times I've been to HD is how fluidly their seating system works. I can't speak for everybody but, in my experience, I've never had to wait for a table (which is incredible considering how many f*cking people are in that line at all times)."
970,"Un. F*cking. Believable. The fois gras and sauternes duck dog with truffle aioli was hands down the best encased meat dish I have ever tasted, and was probably in the top 10 all-time lunches of my life time. It might seem like hyperbole, but honestly, you gotta try this hot dog. I went at 12:45pm on a Tuesday, and there were probably 20 people in line in front of me. As I waited (about 30 min), the line behind me grew steadily. But when I crossed thru the threshold of the door, I saw that there was plenty of seating inside. They've got a good system, and it is WELL worth the wait. I was on a solo mission, and when I got closer to the counter, I realized it was CASH ONLY. I only had $11 cash on me. Panic ensued. I'm frantic, thinking what do I do? Will someone hold my spot? Where is there an ATM?? And I call myself a pro Yelper! How could I let this happen? Ok, get a grip, I think to myself. The fois gras dog is listed as $9, tax included in all listed prices. I'll just get a cup of water to go with it. I get to the front of the line, and there he is: Doug himself, taking orders in his hipster glasses and tshirt. I mention something casually about only having enough cash for a foie gras dog, and he INSISTS that I get fries and a fountain drink with it, refusing to charge me for the fries and drink. He's all like, you waited in line, you came all this way, you gotta try some fries. What?!? This is a rare Tuesday miracle! But that's just the kind of guy Doug is, and that's the kind of place this is. So, long story long, I would make a trip to Chicago just to come back here. And I live in New Orleans. Wow."
971,"I wish I had more room in my stomach so I could try every single one of their amazingly appealing hot dogs. I decided to go with the game of the day, an antelope sausage with garlic sauce and cheddar cheese, and was not disappointed in the least. The easiest way to get here from the L is to just hop on the 77 and get off at California."
972,"Let me start off by saying, I love hot dogs. Like, more than any human being should. I had an afternoon free in Chicago and had been dying to try this place. It was everything I had dreamed it would be. As they say, there truly are no better words than ""encased meats"" This place has every kind of encased meat you could ever want and more. On top of that, the guy at the counter (Doug, is that really you??) was so super friendly and seemed genuinely nice. The only bad thing I can say is that they put grilled onions on their Chicago dog instead of raw onions, so next time I'll have to ask them to substitute that. Even so, it was still a delicious dog. If I had more cash with me (Cash only) I would have tried something fancier than the Chicago dog. I guess that will have to wait until next time...I think Hot Doug's and I are going to have a beautiful future together."
973,"I just moved to New York, and one of the things I miss most about Chicago is Hot Doug's. It just doesn't get better than this. The price is terrific, the options (standards aside) are ever-changing, and Doug is there each time to make you truly believe that, yeah, that Thuringer and fries was a great choice today. If I hadn't left Chicago, I'd still be standing in line on a weekly basis with my roommate."
974,"Hot Doug's doesn't get old and I haven't had a bad visit yet, and that is why I am adding the extra star. I've learned to target my visits on days and times the lines are likely to be short, such as a 90 degree day last week when people didn't want to melt while waiting in line and the wait was less than ten minutes. This time the game of the week was ""Pear and Port Wine Elk Sausage with Foie Gras Aioli and Aged Centenol Cheese"". I actually had to look up Centenol Cheese, because I'd never heard of it. I still don't know exactly what it is, but it was delicious. So finally, in my tradition of Hot Doug's reviews, here are some suggestions to Doug for Games of the Week: Velociraptor Worg Bunyip R.O.U.S. Kraken Chupacabra Shoggoth"
975,"It took about a half hour to get here from downtown, and another half hour waiting in line on noon on a Tuesday. It seemed like it might be possible to move more quickly if we'd shown up at 1 instead. I got the vegetarian dog with everything, and it made for an inexpensive and presumably healthy lunch. My non-vegetarian friend ordered the more expensive, and much heavier, foie gras special and found it interesting but perhaps not something you'd be up for eating twice."
976,"Okay, this place is probably the best thing in the world. Okay, fine. That's hyperbole. This is how good it is, though. My girlfriend and I went to Hot Doug's on a Thursday. The line was about an hour and a half long. We got up to Doug at the counter, and we ordered up five dogs. If I recall correctly, we ordered the famous Foie Gras Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse, and Fleur de Sel; a quarter-pound veal and pork knockwurst; a lamb and pork Loukaniko with olives and goat cheese; a classic Chicago dog; and a sausage made from smoked crayfish and pork. It was glorious. It was so glorious that we went back the next day for more. The line on the next day was two and a half hours. That Friday, we were able to get the duck-fat fries, which are only available on Fridays and Saturdays. At Doug's suggestion we got his truffle aioli as a sauce for our fries. That time we got two of the foie dogs, a Chicago dog, a corn dog, and IIRC a bratwurst. It was worth it, for sure. There was a British visitor, a sailor, who was in the queue with us the second day. He was incredulous that we would wait in that line two days in a row. We told him to keep the faith, that it was really that good. He came up to me and thanked me for encouraging him to wait. He loved it too! Doug is a great guy too. He even has told his competitors where to get the same sausages he has. He has freely shared this knowledge, and it's out there on the internet. I like that sharing spirit. I think that's what make him share such great food with his customers."
977,Foie gras hot dog. get two!! Line is long and you will not regret it.
978,"This is THE best place to have a hotdog in Chicago! They have an assortment of gourmet dogs. Anytime I have someone in town I take them to Hot Doug's, and they always want to come back. I have had almost every dog on the regular menu and assortment of the specialty dogs. My personal favorites are the uber pork and buffalo sausages. It is cash only and if you are going Friday or Saturday be prepared to stand in line for an hour or two, but it is more than worth the wait."
979,Look. Hot Doug's is the best. Everything tastes divine. The duck fat fries are to die for. Doug is the nicest guy who will ever take your order and talk to you about encased meats. You should eat here.
980,"Here's the rundown: You're going to wait for a really long time. And you're going to be glad you did. We ordered: - Duck sausage w/ black truffle aioli and foie gras - Chipotle Chicken sausage w/ pineapple-kiwi salsa and habanero jack cheese - Classic Chicago dogs - and of course, Duck Fat Fries All of it was amazing! And Doug is the sweetest guy ever and threw in free sodas for us, just because. The wait was somewhat grueling, but totally worth it. I can't wait to get back to Chicago again for another trip to Hot Doug's!"
981,"I went to Hot Dougs 3 years ago and, even after years of hot dog noshing in New York, still love and recommend this place above all other hot dog joints. Sure, the line is crazy long and unless you have a car, it is a pain to get here via the CTA, but it is well worth the trip. The hotdog offerings change up frequently, but the pairings of meat + toppings are always well-conceived. It's also nice to have something other than a Chicago dog in Chicago, and this is the one place that hits the spot spectacularly well. Also, they serve really really good duck fat fries. I will say no more. The thing that puts this place over the top is Doug. He takes every order and is personal and friendly about it. While he prefers that you eat his hotdogs with the condiments he chose for them, he won't police you if you want to add more mustard (though you probably shouldn't). This place is unpretentious and a great deal."
982,"Picture this... Its 43 degrees out, a soft mist of rain is constantly falling from the sky and I'm standing in line, outside, getting wet and freezing my Miami Ass off for over an hour. What for you may ask? For Doug's encased meat of course, and I would do it again without question. My sister took me here about a year ago on when I was visiting and on my recent trip there was no question I had to go back. Nothing would stand in my way, not 43 degree weather nor the rain. Here is a quick rundown of what we had. Alligator -- 5 Stars Wild Boar -- 5 Stars Linguisa -- 5 Stars Cord dog 10 Stars (yes out of 5) Duck fat Fries -- A must try dipped in cheese sauce even better The solitary issue I have about Hot Doug's is that ever since my last visit my girlfriend will not stop talking about Doug's encased meat.."
983,"The day after Alinea, Hot Doug's assured me that my palate had not been ruined by its brief frolic with culinary heroin. Sure, foie gras hot dogs are not quite the Food of the People, but hey, that was my least favorite dog. I'm still cool, guys. I know hot dogs only cost like $20 or whatever. We meant to line up at 10:30, but we got out of bed about three hours too late. Lucky for us, the shit weather kept the line reasonable, and we only waited about 20 minutes before placing our orders. Half of that time was spent waiting inside. I loved the cheery interior, which was decked out in primary colors and hot dog kitsch. I enjoyed scanning the collection of hot dog memorabilia, and I chuckled at the historical hot dog timeline occupying a large portion of the main wall. Service was friendly and fast, and due to a well asserted rule that you could only sit after ordering, seating was easy to come by. Our food came out quickly and we were out the door soon after. The dogs were delicious. Michael K. and I shared four, and split an order of duck fat fries with Janice K. Mike and I agreed that the top dog was the chardonnay and jalapeo rattlesnake sausage with berry-currant mustard cream and trugole cheese. I've had two rattlesnake hot dogs in my life, and so far it looks like I love those disgusting animals as long as they're well encased. The sausage here was snappy and ideally firm, and it brought a nice balanced heat. The sauce was perfect, and I loved the shredded cheese, which seemed to melt into it with each bite. Where chardonnay swayed us, sauternes fell short. The foie gras and sauternes duck sausage came with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel, and despite and because of the overload of fancypants ingredients, the dog ended up falling flatter than its siblings. The sausage was overwhelmed by the cold rich cream of several discs of foie gras, and though the truffle aioli helped ground the flavor, it also didn't help cut much fat. The dog didn't taste bad - in fact for a bite or two, it was quite good - but I wouldn't order it again. We had one more dog with elaborate trimmings in the Uber garlic pork sausage with smoked gouda, roasted garlic cloves, and smoky bacon sauce. This was a success, with a juicy link and, well, garlic and bacon and smoky melting gouda on top. Though the special dogs were delicious fun, we couldn't leave without getting the basic Dog - Chicago-style with mustard, caramelized onions, relish, tomatoes, pickle, and celery salt. This was cheap and fantastic, and just as interesting as its more unusual cousins. I'm not used to having pickles right on my hot dogs, but the phallic layers do go together well. As we wolfed down our dogs, we also dug into the duck fat fries. They were nice, well seasoned and golden-brown, if not quite the reason to stand in line. When we left after 3PM, the line looked about the same as when we arrived. Out the door at all hours, I suppose, even in the bitterest cold. I can see why. Hot Doug's is a fun restaurant with an approachable price point, and most spots that fit that description don't offer delicious delicious sausages. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll try and tack myself onto the end of that line."
984,"Went to Hot Doug's for late lunch around 3pm- place was packed like always- i had a Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ... only one the best hot dogs i've ever had. for real.... also had the chicago dog just called the dog here and it was great also..."
985,We tried quite a few off the menu....but without fail the duck w/Foie gras was amazing!
986,Good dogs and the atmosphere is great as long as you are ready to wait 45 mins for an $8 hotdog. Everyone needs to go at least once
987,"- long wait (even before the doors opens, we got there 30mins before) - all the sausages we tried were rich and soft, they hardly had a snap to them (we had the foie gras, the turducken, and the Paul Kelly. - the highlight of the meal were the duckfat fries. fried to a crispy perfection and infused with the duckfat flavors really made them special."
988,I wanted to cry while eating the delicious Foie Gras and Truffle dog... it may have been the best thing I've ever had. This place is the standard of what 5 stars really mean!!
989,"Where else can you pick up strange game sausage dogs in Chicago? And Doug, himself, even takes the order. You'll read a lot about the foie gras and duck sausage and for good reason, it's a peculiar blend of flavors for a dog, but it works and works well. I felt like I was tasting it for the first time with each bite. It's amazing how cheap the Chicago dog is considering how popular this place is. I went on a deep dish binge this trip trying to find the best and maybe next time I'll seek out the best Chicago dog, but I feel like this place serves up a very solid rendition of it."
990,"I don't usually write reviews, but HOT DOUG'S hot dog is definitely worth it. It's best hot dog I've ever had."
991,"Love, love, love it. Having visited Chicago for the 7th time, hubby and I decided it was now or never and rented a car to try out Doug's. Waited about an hour and a half, all the while wondering whether the long wait in a nothing-happening neighborhood on a rainy day was really worth the food inside. The verdict? Worth every 'effin bite of utter ecstasy each of the four specialty dogs offered. Never imagined mere encased meat with toppings could have such amazingly complex and complementary flavor s that explode into major food-gasms with each bite. Doug, move to NYC and set up shop somewhere- can guarantee you will become major food icon and retire as foodie mogul somewhere in the Cajun islands. And DO get your own radio show and entertain us with that beautiful voice of yours. Coming back next time I'm here. WIll be dreaming of foie gras duck dog in the meantime. A MUST-VISIT location if you are in Chicago and want to taste the very best."
992,"I once waited for 2 1/2 hours in the freezing snow for this place. I had frost bite, the menu memorized, and was covered in frozen drool by the time I got in, but it was WORTH IT. The duck sausage with foie and truffle mustard? Gave me a total mouth boner. God, I love this place. As a side note, I taught a high school food studies class and ordered gourmet dogs for the kids to try (which they loved) and Doug gave me over 50 dogs FOR FREE. Because he's a giver. The only thing that sucks about this place is the hours, but I'm willing to deal it with for those amazing sausages."
993,"Oh man, I arrived here 20 minutes before opening on a brisk fall Saturday morning and ended up 50th in line. The 30 minute wait (not including the 20 minutes before opening) was worth it though. All of the hot dogs are named after celebrities and you can get them char grilled, boiled, or some other way I can't remember. They also have specialty dogs. Doug is the one that took our order and he is the most friendly and courteous person that I have ever had the pleasure to order from. He's very helpful in picking something that you'd like and doesn't try to rush you to order to get to the next person in line. One of the things that I was amazed about this place was that even though there was a super long time out the door, whenever you got around to placing your order, there was always a place to sit. The rate at which people finished eating and rate at which people ordered matched perfectly! I got this Portuguese sausage with iberico (?) cheese. It was really good--slightly spicy but it was a great kick. The only thing I didn't like about it was that whenever I bit into it, it smelt like feet. The cheese on it was very, very, strong smelling. But so good! I also got the foie gras hot dog. It was my first time eating foie gras and I was kind of nervous, but that dog was so good! I think the dog is stuffed with duck entrails and then they add 3 pretty thick slices of pate on top. I liked it better than the Portuguese sausage. It was on the heavier side, but so delicious!"
994,"Hot Doug's isn't just a place that sells Hot Dougs. It's a place that sells dreams. And by sell, I mean at a discount. And by dreams I mean rabbits. Or alligators. Or elk. Or Kangaroo. I've had experiences at this place that almost made me cry-- that's how happy I was. The line might seem long but the mix of toppings will change you. The service is impeccable because Doug Sohn is a world-class host. The cheese fries are the best anywhere and the decor and environment is so much fun, it's great for repeat visits. He plays his own eclectic mix of music and the crowd is a who's who of Chicago luminaries, in addition to enthusiastic tourists from around the world. Hot Doug's may not be the cure for sadness and depression but it sure can help."
995,"Ordered the ""Cherry-Infused Venison Sausage"" and the daily special ""Rabbit Sausage with Pumpkin Creme and Goat Cheese"". Both were $8. Both were delicious. Great service inside with the food coming out quickly. The only annoying thing was waiting in line outside in the twenty degree weather. The store opens at 10:30 am, and we were there at 10:15am. A line of 30 people were already in front of us. I wish Hot Doug's could provide heating lamps or expand his store so more people can wait inside."
996,"Hot Doug's. Best Hot Dogs ever without a doubt! Is there any other place you can get Foie Gras hot dogs? I think not! Found out about this fantastic hot dog place through Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, so I marked Hot Doug's down on my must try list during the trip to Chicago last month. After getting to the place, we had to wait like 45 mins on a windy, freezing cold day. Once I had a bite of the hot dog, though, I completely forgot about the cold that I just endured. No Reservations? No complaints! Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - To die for. There were four round slices of Foie Gras pate, creamy, silk and rich. Melted in my mouth. I regretted not ordering two after finishing my Foie Gras hot dog. Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise, Raw Milk-Cheddar Cheese Spread and Crispy Fried Onions - Surprisingly delicious, with just a little kick to it. Crispy fried onions were thinly sliced on top, crispy and crunchy, along with the mild-cheddar cheese, it was a great combination. Antelope Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper-Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese - The red pepper was cooked perfectly, neither raw nor too soft, and it meshed well with the Garlic Mayonnaise. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ I wanted to try out all of their specialty sausages if I could. Please, someone tell me there's some place similar in San Francisco."
997,"Hot Dougs is amazing! You're going to wait in line no matter when you go but it is well worth it. There are so many different types of meat and great toppings! My favorites so far has been the cognac and bacon pheasant sausage, and the foie gras and duck sausage. Yum"
998,"Came and visited Chicago from California. I took a 45 minute taxi ride in the rain to get to this place. The dogs were very good. We tried the classic Dog, Chicago style...always a classic. We also tried the Steve Swisher chicken sausage, Sal Tessio Italian sausage, and The Norm Crosby (beef, pork, garlic). All were very good, but the classic Dog was our favorite, the others were not as impressive. Glad we came out, even though it cost us nearly $40 just to get there and back through taxi."
999,"I have to say this place was worth the 30 minute wait out in the cold. Maybe it would be a little better with a toasted bun...never having been here I was told to try the standard Chicago dog. I have to say it was pretty good with everything on it. (pickles, tomatoes, relish, caramelized onions) I got my hot dog fried and grilled. Probably helped with the taste of the dog. I came on Friday so they had duck fat fries available. That extra rich buttery fat makes those fries taste pretty good. Service was excellent once you actually make it to the counter to order. The long line is just to order your food. Seating is pretty easy for smaller groups...I suggest breaking your group up in to small groups if you are coming with a lot of people I'd say if I was in Chicago again I'd make another stop here."
1000,"Five stars for a hot dog joint sounds ridiculous, of course, unless you've been to the encased meat mecca that is Hot Doug's. We made the forty-five minute pilgrimage by car for the sole purpose of trying Hot Doug's wieners of lore. This is our tale.... Once upon a time, in a land far, far away (Hyde Park), three souls set forth on a journey to find the fabled Hot Doug's. Over highways and avenues, through concrete jungles and treacherous traffic jams, we rode in search of glorious sausages and duck fat fries. At long last, we arrived. As foretold, the line of sausage seekers began at the end of an iron gate where many a weary traveler wondered aloud if the wieners were worth the wait. Alack, the wait was long. *""I wish I was eating,"" a young maiden lamented. But still the line wound its way past pigs and pines to end in a wonderous room filled with psychedelic hues and the sweet aroma of wieners and fries. But not just any wieners and fries. Lo, it is Hot Doug's and it is good. (Along the way you will pass a sign instructing you not to choose a table before you've placed your order. Trust this sign.) After all was said and done, our journey lasted an hour and forty-five minutes on account of our obstacles. The great Mr. Hot Doug, himself, greeted us cheerfully and took our order. We tried the Sally Vega (the corndog to end all corndogs), the Cheeseburger Sausage (don't knock it till you've tried it), fries and duck fat fries. The duck fat fries (which are available ONLY Friday and Saturday) were the stuff of legend. They had a depth of flavor that the regular fries lacked. Their regular fries are awfully good, though. I chose the Marty Allen (a Thuringer), fried and grilled and topped with ""everything."" My only lament is that I did not show more restraint with the toppings because it was a shame to mask the deliciousness of the dog. As weird as it may seem, I could actually discern the pork from the beef and taste the garlic. And I LOVE garlic so I was quite pleased with Hot Doug's Thuringer. My fellow travelers tried the Elvis and the Chicago dog and both were satisfied with their wieners of choice. The Chicago dog was declared ""the best"" of all Chicago dogs, and this from one who has sought out the Holy Grail of Chicago style hotdogs. In the end, we were all delighted by the wonders contained within Hot Doug's. Do not allow the naysayers to delay your quest. Hot Doug's is worth the journey (but be sure to bring cash because Hot Doug does not dig the plastic). *actual statement from a young girl in the Hot Doug's line"
1001,Oh Doug.....we share your passion for encased meats.....how you perfected the art of three star dining and fast and friendly service that starts from you. You read the reviews....so there's nothing I can say that really equals what the yelpers have been saying...so I'll just give you some quick pointers: CASH ONLY Weird hours(they're not open for dinner....open at 1030am...closed at 4pm monday thru saturday) check the website (http://hotdougs.com) for what's on their special menu....and what holidays they will be closed on....Doug loves taking extended vacations so check the website often....and before you plan on making a trip to there... First time there? NP....make sure you let Doug know(he is always on the cash register taking your orders) it's your first time there so he can happily guide you through what you want to order.....he is extremely patient and friendly...so don't be worried if it's your first time... My recommendations if you're there the first time....get the FOIS GRAS dog....imo their best product other than their fresh cut fries deep fried in DUCK FAT! DUCK FAT fries are only available on fridays and saturdays....and they are worth the $3.50....you will get a large amount.... Lastly...have fun and enjoy Doug's vision and passion for his little encased meat emporium and sausage superstore!
1002,"Since there's thousands of reviews for Hot Doug's, I'll try to keep my review as concise, interesting, and relevant as possible! I lived in Chicago for the past 3 years and just moved this past summer. I had to get my booty to Hot Doug's. Let's just say, I had high expectations...and they were somewhat met. Pros - Duck fat fries - these are as good as everyone says - Mr. Doug himself takes the order - I like me some old fashion Chicago dog. Them other dogs too fancy. People love them though, so try them if you are up to it! Cons - With all the anticipation of waiting in line and then the stress of ordering fast because of the long line, there's too many menu options! - The day we went the hood was broken and they gave us choice: (1) Wait more and take your chances (2) Wait more tomorrow - I was upset because I took a $30 taxi just to be sure I was there super early Conclusion It's like Pink Hot Dog in LA, if you are in the area, you just have to go and try it. It's like a rite of passage into the city. Same thing for Hot Doug's - if your in Chicago, take your e-reader and camelback, and make your way over to Hot Doug's!"
1003,"Hmmmm....where do i begin. I guess i should begin by mentioning that on my last trip to chicago nearly 3 years ago, we were on a damn mission to get here to try the infamous hot dogs & duck fat fries that Bourdain raved about on his chicago episode. A long train ride, and a long nearly mile long walk over in the sketchy part of chicago led us to hot dougs. We were so stoked about finally eating here. We didn't do much research though, and came near closing time (around 3:30ish, and they close at 4). So what happens? the worker guy cut the line off right in front of us! I think at the time i was stunned more than anything, bc usually i would be more aggressive and talk my way into getting us in. Needless to say, we were devastated and bummed that we made that long journey, only to be dissapointed! Well this time around, i was way more prepared! I planned my whole trip around making sure we were able to get here early saturday morning (already anticipating the long line that awaits, since duck fat fries are only served fri & saturdays!). We caught the train to the belmont station and grabbed a taxi this time. Went and stood in the already long line, but was already mentally prepared for this. The weather was overcast and windy. We waited a total of 1 hour and 35 minutes in line, and lucked out as the rain started pouring after about an hour and 20 min. Felt bad for the others who waited in line after us though bc they were literally drenched! the crazy things we do for the love of hot dogs?!?! When we finally made our way to the front of the line, Doug was at the counter to greet us and to take our order. Chipper and friendly as what others mention. Between the 2 of us (who both don't eat pork or red meat), we opted for the veggie dog (chicago style, and grilled with all the fixings), the duck sausage special with foie gras, the chicken sausage with gouda cheese, and of course the infamous duck fat fries!!! All were delicious and I particularly enjoyed the foie gras dog and the veggie dog. Very tasty and definitely hit the spot. They gave us an extra order of fries, and so we were a bit overwhelmed with a bunch of food left over. I recommend coming with a group so you can order a bunch of different flavors of encased meat. And would definitely come when you can experience the duck fat fries! One serving is definitely enough to share amongst 2 people. Yes....finally. My trip was complete."
1004,"I've seen Hot Doug's featured on TV in a few shows. When we planned a trip to Chicago, I was excited to finally get to try this place. I knew to get there early because I've heard & read about how long the lines get, which worked out pretty well because the line went pretty quickly. My daughter had the Dave Pound (a corn dog). I'm not crazy about corn dogs but I would totally eat this one. My husband had the Elvis (polish sausage) with everything on it. He said it was probably the best hot dog he's ever had. I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse & fleur de sel). Ohmyfreakingoodness was this absolutely amazing! The sausage was so flavorful and moist. The foie gras mousse was creamy, not too saulty. The truffle aioli and fleur de sel just brought out all the flavor goodness. I could've eaten a 2nd one! We made the mistake of going on a day other than Friday or Saturday so we missed the chance to try their Duck Fat Fries. Their regular fries were still yummy nonetheless. The decor is great. Vibrant, lively colors. The artwork in the bathrooms are pretty funny. Doug was taking orders and was nice enough to pause for a quick picture. I'm sure we will go back to Hot Doug's every time we're in Chicago...it's THAT good!"
1005,"Fresh off my successful venture to find Chicago's spiciest burger, I can now die happy that I sampled some of Chicago's finest hotdogs. After the requisite wait outside, we sat down with some equally food savy patrons at a table. I ordered the duck sausage dog with foie-gras, alligator dog, and chorizo chicken dog with mole. The duck sausage and foie-gras was absolutely sublime. I don't remember what sauce was on it but it was ridiculously rich and decadent. The alligator dog was well done and the star was definitely the alligator meat which was surprisingly slightly swampy. I think the mole on the chicken sausage was probably the best sauce out of all three. It was a very interesting mixture of different spices that somehow didn't get muddled out all together. After seemingly eating my body weight in hot dogs, I stumbled out of the restaurant in a meat induced trance. I have no idea or recollection of how I drove home with that degree of food coma setting in but the entire experience was perfect. If you come here, absolutely try their specialty dogs although their normal chicago dog is pretty damn good as well. Also, Doug is probably one of the nicest people you will meet in chicago."
1006,"Hot doug's is fine. It's good encased meats and nothing all that much more. Do I have to praise the place because many are fool enough to wait 45 minutes or longer to get in? Frank N dogs is truly better product and made in house. I don't think Doug makes his dogs...maybe I'm wrong, but most of his stuff is purchased from local purveyors...good ones, yes, but he's not growing his animals and grinding his meat. It's really good stuff, nothing more, nothing less."
1007,"There is nothing I can really say here that has not already been said.... This place is well worth the wait in line. We waited four about 25 minutes to place our order inside, and after ordering the service was speedy and the dog's were pleasing. The only recommendation I can make is don't think of the hot dogs as your backyard bbq type. The are a meal. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 dogs each with a side of cheesy fries and even though our appetites were large... Hot Doug's won. Soooo GOOD. Check it out."
1008,"Totally worth the wait! Funny that I came all the way to Chicago thinking I would try a Chicago-style dog...maybe I failed by not trying one, but damn, Hot Doug's just offered so many great choices! I would've tried everything on the menu if that was humanly possible. I went with Mitchell P. so I'm not going to repeat everything he said...just that you've got to try these dogs! I haven't been to any other gourmet hot dog joints that would even be worth comparing to the awesomeness of the ones here. Top your order off with some duck fat fries and you're set. (I think they only offer this on Fri and Sat?) I'm not going to be bias on which dog you should try...all seemed to be fab and I love how they don't shiest you on the toppings, they load 'em up! You know how to visit a city and try out a place, think it's good, but the next time you visit you think, ""Oh maybe I should try something different""? Not Hot Doug's. It's permanently on my Chicago must-do every time list. You just can't get enough!"
1009,"Obviously this review is utterly unnecessary, as everyone in the world is aware of (and currently waiting in line for) these freakishly amazing hot dogs. But for my own sense of completeness, I am here to tell the world HOLY CRAP, these are amazing encased meats. I went on a Monday at 11:30, so the line wasn't so bad. Probably waited about a half hour. All I'll add to the already lengthy commentary is GO WITH A FRIEND OR TWO - the kind that will eat anything and love to split stuff. It is so worth it to try a bunch of sausages. We split 3 between 2 people, plus the large cheese fries. We couldn't even pick a winner, they were all so ridiculously good. Also, wow, Doug is really friendly! I'd be mean if I had to take orders for 5 hours every day, but this guy is genuinely pleasant!"
1010,"4.5 stars. There seems to always be a line here and considering it really isn't near much, it stands out... The only disappointment was when we found out duck fat fries were only served on Fridays, so we missed those. I was impressed how nice the workers were inside even though it was busy. You would think there would be no place to sit, but people tend to eat quick and leave to clear table space. The Chicago dog is legit and so are the tots and pigs in a blanket (especially w/ cheese sauce). The bacon wrapped dog was good and the prices were good. They did have some crazy dogs that were expensive, but they're unique. This place is worth the wait and one of the best places I ate in Chicago."
1011,"Alright, let's face it, with close to 2,000 reviews, I don't think what else I can add. Just this: Get the foie gras with duck sausage. I'm pretty sure truffle aioli is the best invention in the world. Get 2 of those. Even if you're not that hungry. You'll regret it, and by this time, another 2 hour wait isn't that pretty. There is street parking, so don't worry about that. Don't wear a black tshirt. You will be standing under the sun for quite awhile, and you'll have to take turns hiding in the shade with your fiance whom, for some reason, also wore a black tshirt."
1012,"What can be said about Hot Doug's that has not already been said before? Drove by around 1:30 pm on a recent rainy Thursday and was pleased to see there was virtually no line, so decided to stop in. Ordered the foie gras and Sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, as is apparently customary in this establishment. And while I had read from other yelpers that this in itself could suffice as a meal, I wanted to try other flavors as well given I am not sure when my return trip might be. Plus I saw some people (of normal proportions physically) tucking into 3 sausages, so seemed to be the norm here. Initially planned on ordering a bratwurst, thinking it might perhaps offset the richness of flavor of the first sausage, however as I approached Doug to order, I sort of felt as if this was a cop out in a place where you could order any other number of flavor combinations. So also went with the rosemary and garlic smoked chicken sausage, and coupled the sausages with an order of cheese fries for good measure. Grabbed my drink, took a seat by window, and my order came out promptly. Overall the sausages were definitely like nothing I had ever had before, however in hindsight I think that choosing these 2 sausages was a bit of a mistake. Altogether way too rich and in a sense was overkill; left feeling stuffed and like I had exhausted my taste buds as opposed to contented and pleased with my meal. It is hard to argue with the success of this place, however I am not sure if you will ever catch me braving an hour+ line in order to eat their sausages.."
1013,"Hot Doug's is a must-do for Chicago natives. The hot dogs / sausages are delicious and creative, definitely. Kangaroo?!? Foie Gras?!? Rattlesnake!?! In a sausage?!? Was it worth an hour wait in the cold? I'd say yes. But for me, a lot of it came down to a rite of passage - ensuring that I did not live in Chicago but fail to go to the city's most esteemed hot dog stand. Kind of like going to a Bears game when it is below freezing or to the Taste of Chicago when it is boiling outside. No pain, no gain, right? I'm not fully sure it lived up to all of my expectations - I don't see this as a regular stopping point - but worth doing at least once and I'll probably drag my out of town friends there too."
1014,". Now-- My husband had to beg me to come in here. Eating a whole bunch of fatty sausages in no way appeals to me, especially if you have to wait 2 hours to get in. Come on a Monday, right when they open (10am), as we did, and your wait in line will be a breeze. It took us about 15 mins to get to the counter. Once I spied the menu, I began to understand what the fuss is all about. To say that this restaurant serves hot dogs, is to say that Gucci sells t-shirts. The menu descriptions alone transcend ""hot dog place"". A great deal of inventiveness and culinary care is taken in creating the sausages from often unusual meats (antelope? quail?) and pairing them with toppings that will blow your gastrophiliac mind. Each dog is huge. One could easily be a meal with fries, but me and my hsuband, our reason effectively blocked by the food equivalent of titties shaking in your face, ordered 5 dogs and split them between us. We did not eat for the rest of the day. The dog that sticks out most in my mind, and that begs me to return despite having since adopted veganism, was the one topped with creamy, delicious coins of foie gras. Heaven. We also split an order of cheese fries, because fitting into pants is for nerds.. The best order of cheese fries I've ever eaten, this coming from someone who hates soggy cheese fries. The fires are spiced and the cheese... well, it's not Velveeta, that's for sure. Something a bit nicer. Too bad Monday is not duck fat fry day (gotta get down on duck fat fry day). I really wanted to try them, so I know there is a round of vegan turncoat-ism in my future. I would like to point out to the vegetarians that they do offer a veggie dog, which I may try if only to review it. They also have a classic Chicago do and a range of more traditional dog toppings for the Philistines. In summary, Come here. Eat here. Live here."
1015,"Hot dang, Hot Doug's! I don't know what I can say about this place that hasn't been said already. Yeah, I know there are lots of places in Chicago where you can get a pretty good red hot, but Doug's has just the right amount of char on it - you can really taste the grill. And his buns are super soft and tasty (hey man, the hot dog buns, get your mind out of the gutter!). Not to mention that, but Doug himself is awesome. He really moves the line through (and there is a line, so don't be thinking you're gonna get your dog after a 5 or even 10 minute wait) without being a total tool, and makes the service there super personal. I even tried to speed up my ordering process for him because the line behind me was long and it was close to closing time, but I think it's really hard to get past Doug without him engaging you in a little chit-chat. So I got the regular old red hot and the legendary foie gras dog. I've already mentioned the red hot, so now let's talk about this foie gras dealie. I don't know about the calorie count - frankly I don't care. I'm sure my pant size went up exponentially with each bite I took (and maybe my serum cholesterol level, too). I think I may have blacked out a little somewhere in the middle. It's kind of like a drug. I swear, you can taste every single flavor that goes into that puppy. The truffle sauce is light and not overpowering (when I make stuff with truffle oil, I just like to dump it in, but not everyone likes that, and then all you can taste is the truffle flavor - this was not that), you can taste the tang of the sauterne in the duck sausage, and I just don't know what to say about the foie gras. It's like meat butter, right? So good. One Saturday when I've got a good 2 hours to spare I'll head down there and dive into the duck fat fries - I don't know how that can be wrong. A couple of warnings: you will have to wait in line here. It doesn't matter what time you go or what day of the week. There will be a line, and it will take you at least 30 minutes from the time you get there till the time you get your food - plan on anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours for the whole process to go down. Hot Doug's closes at 4, so don't get there at 3.50 and then be upset because you couldn't get in. That outside door locks at 4, and whoever's still outside when it locks stays outside. The hot sausages... they're really hot. I mean really. When he says 'mighty, mighty hot', he ain't just whistlin' dixie. That is all... I think."
1016,"If there was a dislike button on this review, I'm sure plenty of yelpers will downvote me for this one. The reason for the 3 stars is because I dislike foie gras and had 4 huuuumongous chunks sitting on top of my duck foie-gras hot dog. Alright, so I completely admit it was my fault for a poor choice in ordering. But in my defense, I thought the foie-gras was mixed into the hot dog itself. My disappointment could also be from the fact that I've been trying to come here for the past year, and finally paid a $60 round trip taxi ride for a $9 hot dog. I would give it another shot if I'm in town on a weekday, but refuse to wait in the 2 hour weekend line."
1017,"When I first heard about people lining up for hot dogs, I was like, ""You've got to be kidding me."" Don't get me wrong. Occasionally I like a good hot dog. But stand in line for 1-3 hours? No way. Today was a lovely summer day and we found ourselves with a little time, so my boyfriend decided we should go to Hot Doug's, because he'd been one of those schmucks who stood in line and said he wanted me to be able to have the experience. We drove by and when he saw the line, he said it'd probably be about an hour. After some debating and realizing this would probably be the last time we could do this for a while, we decided to go for it. Our total time, including eating, took us a little over an hour. I had planned to get only one dog, but he said I'd likely do fine with two. So I chose one from their cheap ($2-3) regular menu and one from their specialty menu ($7-9). We also shared a small order of cheese fries. We ended up splitting our dogs so we'd get a good sampling, and it was delicious. The foie gras dog was a new experience for me, as I'd never actually had foie gras before. But it was good. The service was excellent. The cashier was very friendly and thorough and patient, which made the experience so much better and worth the wait. Pros: variety of dogs, reasonable prices, friendly service, delicious food. Con: long wait (but worth it!)"
1018,"Waiting 4.5 hours in freezing cold winter weather for a mediocre hot dog? NOT worth it. The line wasn't even that long where we were standing.. So, why did we wait so long? For some reason, we figured ""We came all the way down here, we might as well keep waiting. Maybe it will be worth it!"" I had high hopes for this place.. The most fun part was meeting people in the line. You get to know a lot about them after standing next to them for 4.5 hours. We actually sat down at a table with them after we got our food and ate together. We went here after I saw it on No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain. I literally made it my goal to come here the weekend after the Chicago episode came out. Buuut I was incredibly disappointed. We ordered a bunch of different hot dogs. The foie gras, kangaroo, etc etc. The buns were cold and hard. The hot dogs were nothing special imo. They were cold. I also ordered the duck fat fries that everyone was raving about. EH. They were not crispy. They were soggy, room temperature, nothing special about them. Our total came out to over $50 for 2 people on freakin hot dogs and fries. Plus, they only take cash so that was a little inconvenient at the moment. The best thing we had was the corn dog. The $2 corn dog was the best thing on the menu. Sad... We went a while ago, but I won't be going out of my way to go to Hot Doug's anymore. Seems like TV made it extremely popular overnight and there are a lot of good reviews, but I was VERY disappointed. Maybe I got them on a busy day, but I doubt I'll be going there again anytime soon."
1019,"This is one of the places that a person just has to try out when he is insuring Chicago. It is a bit touristy and the lines are long but it's also novel and fun. My wife and I shared the foie grad dog, the rib eye hot dog, the Bridgette Bardot, the corndog, and the fries cooked in duck fat. Everything was pretty solid. The duck fat fries were tasty but a bit greasier and soggier than normal fries. Portions were big so I recommend sharing these with about 4 people. The foie gras hot dog was delicious but it was so rich that my wife and I found it hard to each finish half. The rib eye had a nice meaty texture but was somewhat dry. More chimichurri sauce would have been nice. The Bridgette Bardot was solid but otherwise unremarkable. If you don't come around often, I would recommend sticking with only the special menu. The line is long but it moves rather quickly. Tables open up often and service is very kind."
1020,"This place is absolutely fantastic! Best hotdogs I have ever had. The combinations are amazing and always changing and the encased meats are brilliantly garnished. If you're a picky eater (in terms of meat or cheese) probably not worth waiting in line for to get a traditional Chicago hotdog. However, if you enjoy trying new foods (alligator meat, foie duck sausage, buffalo meat ect) then Hot Doug's is a MUST. Aside from the hotdogs, the french fries are pretty good, Friday and Saturday's they have them fried in duck fat which are awesome! I've had all of the special hotdogs and can vouch for all of them! A few important things to consider: Hot Doug's ONLY takes CASH, no credit, so be prepared. The hotdogs are pretty expensive between $7-9 each. The line is ALWAYS long and extends outside of the building so get there early! Hot Doug's is only open for lunch, 10:00AM-4:00PM and are often closed for holidays so call in advance! And finally I recommend bringing 3 people and buying all the special hotdogs and splitting them in three so you can try all of them!"
1021,Duck fat fries Friday!! I literally waited a YEAR to come back to Chicago/Hot Doug's for a year. Love.
1022,"One of the best memories I have of Chicago. People tell you, ""duck fat fries will kill you"", but guess what, eating the normal processed food we eat will kill us too. So everyone HAS to try real duck fat fries sometime in their life--you can definitely taste the difference. I wouldn't recommend eating this everyday, but that is probably why they only serve it on Fridays and Saturdays. One last night: order the foie gras hot dog. You will absolutely not find this anywhere else. It is incredible, definitely an experience. This place and Weiner Circle, definitely live up to the Chicago hot dog rep. Makes me a proud Chicagoan."
1023,"I had to do some photos for a website here and decided to go on a Monday in order to at least try some food without waiting the typical 2 hours as most do on the weekends. After 20 minutes in line, I finally made my order of the Anna Kendrick and a Chicago style as well to compare. Let me just say that I'm a BIG fan of hot dogs and as far as food goes, I will try anything at least once. Having said that, I would be more than happy to wait in line any day for Hot Doug's! I have never had a hot dog as smokey and snappy as the dogs I had here. Absolutely delicious! I didn't get a chance to try the duck fat fries but one day I'm sure."
1024,"Gourmet hot dogs? Well, not quite. Hot Doug's is everything you want in a hot dog joint and everything you didn't know you needed. It's a classy little joint in a strange part of the neighborhood, but it's always buzzing with a long line so always remember to go about an hour ahead of the time you want to actually eat. At first, the line might turn you off and you'll begin to weigh in whether it's worth waiting so long for some hot dogs, but then you begin to wonder why so many people wait so long for hot dogs and you take the gamble only to realize that it was well worth every minute of the anticipation that is satisfied by the creation of Mr. Doug Sohn. I made the mistake of asking whether the Pork Curry sausage was good and Doug simply replied to me, ""Do you like delicious?"" I carefully answered.. ""Yes...."" I almost wanted to reply with a witty answer, like, ""Am I Asian?"" In any case, Doug is a certified Hot Dog connoisseur and a funny man. Don't get overhyped with the food selection, though. They are every bit delicious, but remember one thing: They're still hot dogs. Don't expect 5 star gourmet food. I'd recommend the alligator and the regular hot dog. I thought the Duck fat fries were a little overrated, but they're still worth a try nonetheless. And don't forget to bring plenty of cash. It would be tragedy to have waited so long only to find out that credit is not accepted."
1025,"As we walked to Hot Doug's around 1pm there was a line out the door. That was a good sign! It was kinda chilly that day and there was even a CNN crew out there braving the Chicago cold air. We finally got to the counter and decided to try the Foi Gras hot dog. Yes... that's right, we got they have a Foi Gras hot dog and it was even $10. We had to get it since the place was a little bit outside of where we stayed. It was excellent! I wish I could afford another one... As we walked back to the train station, I remembered I don't like Foi Gras because of ethical reasons. I felt bad about it and promise myself to never do it again. I still recommend it though... (;"
1026,- its hot dougs... we all know its freakin awesome. - it has mayer hawthorne's stamp of approval (so it's legit). - duck fat fries are of course bomb. dont worry about the fat part.... its all natural... HAHA
1027,"My political science professor once told the class: ""When I was younger, I had a lot of time and little money, so I donated my time by volunteering for political campaigns and such. Now, I have little time and lots of money, so I donate to support candidates."" This relationship between time and money is just one of the many topics I thought about as I waited in line at Hot Doug's for over two-and-a-half hours on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. For reference, the line started along the sidewalk just on the other side of the alley behind the restaurant. An enterprising ice cream truck sold frozen treats and $1 bottles of water to the waiting crowd. It really wasn't a ton of people, but the line just moved so slowly. When I finally did get to order, I was still perplexed why the wait was so long--our group of five got their food in less than 5 minutes after ordering and while all the tables were taken, there were still a number of outward facing seats along the window. On top of that, there was an outdoor eating area available that I didn't visit. As for the food, the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel is extraordinary. The foie gras and truffle aioli combine to make every bite rich, creamy, and memorable. The other two items I had were just so-so: The Corn Dog is exactly what you would expect and not that different than what you would get at a ballpark or a fair. The Duck Fat Fries were...not all what they are quacked up to be. I really didn't experience any extra ""oomph"" from the fact that these were fried in duck fat. To be clear, if the wait were 30 minutes of less, I would bump Hot Doug's up to four stars--the foie gras hot dog was just that good. But to rate the whole experience--an experience I wouldn't want to go through again--I'll leave Hot Doug's at two stars."
1028,"Oh Hot Doug's. You are fantastic. I love you. The only thing I hate is the wait and the fact that you close early. Come on, dudes! They seem to purposely slow down the line by taking orders very, very slowly. I get it, since there aren't that many places to sit, but still. Everything I've ever had there is fantastic, but I will go out on a limb and say the duck fat fries aren't really that much better than normal fries. They're tasty, but not like, ""Oh my god I must eat these every day of my life"" tasty. The interior of the place is hilarious, and they are super friendly. SAUSAGE RULES."
1029,"Just want to add to the chorus of people who can't seem to rate this place high enough. After having seen Hot Doug's on No Reservations and marveling at the pure awesome that was the Foie Gras Dog I knew that on my next visit to Chicago we HAD to go here. We waited about two hours in the heat of the midday sun and were a couple innings late to my first ever Cubs game but it was absolutely worth it. I mean really the Cubs haven't put out a product as good as Hot Doug's does since 1908, but I digress. My wife and I split 3 hot dogs and a single order of the duck fat fries were enough for our whole table of 4. We had the Keira Knightley which is their red hot served topped with neon green relish, the aforementioned Foie Gras Dog which is Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel and the Mountain Man Dog which is Antelope, Elk, Buffalo, Venison with Roasted Yellow Pepper Sauce and Daru Cheese. They were all really excellent. The red hot was simple but really well done. The chunks of Foie Gras on top of the duck sausage are so ridiculously large but so very delicious. But for me the highlight was the Mountain Man the yellow pepper sauce was just the perfect compliment to the meat and cheese. I could have eaten 3 of those myself. Hot Doug's is now a necessary stop on any future Chicago vacations!"
1030,"Hot Doug's never disappoints. Bought five different dogs to take to San Francisco to intro them to my family. When I asked Doug what dogs travel best, he replied, ""Sausages are made to travel."" He was right. Even after the flight from Chicago, we warmed three of the dogs and they were fantastic. Next day, we warmed the other two. Still excellent. My family now requires me to bring dogs to SF any time I come. Sausage time has been born. I would recommend any of the game of the week or specials. While everyone loves the duck fat fries, I prefer the tater tots. Light and crispy and oh so delicious. If they have the crayfish sausage, do not hesitate--best sausage I've ever had."
1031,THE GOOD: This place is a classic. You walk into a musuem of sausage history plus it seems all the other reviewers have covered the good points. There were many children enjoying. THE BAD: The line. Nothing green. Should consider adding a pickled carrot salad or coleslaw to the menu. THE UGLY: The wait and the distance from the city.
1032,"Well worth the wait, just go in the morning and wait till lunch time with everybody else! I love the fact that the crowd is well balanced between tourists and locals. Duck fat fries are over rated in my opinion... I'd rather save the kcals for more delicious hot dogs!!! The special dogs are wonderful, they seem to be very creative about what they can encase in the sausage, but definitely have to get the Chicago style dog!!!! It's amazing. Not veg friendly... Duh... But yeah, I love hot dougs!"
1033,"Your best bet is to go mid-week (summer is busiest) after the lunch rush. I went at 2 p.m. on a Monday and the line was only about 40-45 people -- I say that, too, without a crumb of irony. It's busy, folks. Why? It's good, really good. All good restaurants are, by definition, overrated, so why even have that conversation? It's tasty, fun and worth going with friends and people visiting from out of town. They will take pictures of the wall and walk away happy. Everyone wins. And Doug is a nice guy and will engage you in conversation when he's not super slammed, so chat him up briefly. Out-of-the-way place (unless you live in Avondale for one reason or another), but it's quickly becoming a Chicago hub. Oh, and bring cash. They don't take credit cards, and now that I have gone about seven times, I am just starting to remember this fact."
1034,"Best hot dogs ever. Like others have said, you have to get the specialty dogs. Also, if you cant eat one of them (i.e. allergic to shrimp, etc) you can get the toppings on a regular hot doug (""char -dog"") for the price of a regular hot dog! you cant beat that. To avoid lines, go early or late, and never go on a fri/sat. I dont think the duck fat fries are worth it, and there are other places that do things with the fries. This is a must -eat for anyone living in chicago and anyone who plans to visit. Oh yeah, cash only, ample parking, may be up to an hour wait if you go between 11-3pm."
1035,We went some time ago and waited in this crazy long line. When we got in after like an hour. The hot dog was not even that good. Not worth the hype
1036,"It is hard to gather the words to.describe the hot dogs here. With a variety ranging from Fois Gras to rattlesnake, it is easily one of the more interesting restaurants one been to. Granted that I had to wait more then 2 hours to get a taste of their well known dogs, I would have to say it is something to have to come to at least once in your lifetime. Luckily, I came with a group so hat we were able to taste a number of them. (Because to be frank, I don't know if I'd want to stand in this line again.) - fois gras and sauternes duck sausage: a must! It's my favorite dog here. There was a certain degree of flavor that permeated through each bite. For only $9, it's quite the deal if you ask me. - the special of the day: lamb & beef gyro sausage: This was one of the top 3 ones I've tried. I'm a huge fan of gyros so I absolutely loved this one. - smoked yak sausage (with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and smoked gouda cheese): one of my favorites. It was very flavorful and the gouda was just icing. - bacon sausage: i thought this one was not as flavorful as the others and the creme was overwhelming. - reg chicago hotdog: it was good but lacked the taste explosion as some of the other gourmet ones. There were toppings that made it taste fresh but it was difficult to taste all the toppings in each bite. They simply overwhelmed it. -duck fat fries: a must! Unforunately, they only sell these on certain days (Fri & Sat), so get them if you happen to be there on the days they are served. The line is ridicously long and tables are first come first serve. It's not the most ideal restaurant arrangement, but it's definitely worth giving it a try. I hear it's only an hour wait if you stand in line at 11am. The rule here is ""the earlier the better."""
1037,"Ok, so I'm not even a huge hotdog enthusiast and this place blew me away. Feel free to pick your basics, and there are plenty- corn dogs, beef dogs, etc. There guys are famous, however, for their multitude of regular and daily specials. Ever want to try a boar dog? A dog with duck on top? You got it if you come on the right day! Staff are friendly here, prices are SUPER, but the wait is always long, the tables are few (but there is outside patio seating), and they only take cash. Next time I'm in the mood for dogs, I will definitely consider returning, assuming I can get to the ATM first."
1038,"OMG amazing. That's about all I can say about this place. After I saw Anthony Bourdain devour a foie gras hot dog on No Reservations, I knew this needed to be on my list of things to visit when I was in Chicago. The line is insanely long but oh so worth it. Apparently, I got there when the line was ""manageable"". I still waited 45min. I love that they have a policy that if you have not ordered, you can't sit down. Somehow, there is always a place to sit once you order! You have to get the foie grad hot dog. It's just amazing. But you know, the standard Chicago-style dog is great too! And don't forget the duck fat fries. This is a must-go. It's a little out of the way but who cares. Make an effort and go. I can't wait to go back."
1039,"I actually came here on a July but I was too lazy to post a review. Hot Dougs is awesome and worth an hour wait. Just make sure to bring water or an umbrella for shelter. They were nice enough to turn on a hose for people waiting in line to cool off. There was an ice cream camped out there ready to sell water and frozen treats. Once we finally got into Hot Dougs we ordered a Duck Sausage with Foie Gras Mousse, a Garlic and Pork Sausage, a Mountain Man (venison), and an order of Duck Fat Fries. Hot Dougs is cash only. When we went to pay we were short 2 bucks. So when we were deciding what to drop or run to the car to grab the rest of the money. Doug asked us how much we had and said ok that's fine and let us go short. Doug is super nice and very personable. As for the food, the Duck Sausage is a definite must order! Highly recommended. So nice ad rich. The garlic and pork sausage was also good too if you love garlic. The mountain man was just ok. The duck fries were really good but I don't think I can really tell the difference. Overall, I would say you definitely need to try this place at least once. I'm would return but probably on a weekday when there's a much shorter wait. Just remember to bring enough cash."
1040,Went last friday around 11 and there was still a long line despite the rain. Troopers! First thing I noticed was that the menu changed. The names changed and the prices went up. I'm glad they raised their prices though because I am more than happy to spend more on establishments that really care about their job. Is Hot Doug's BYOB and I never knew about it? I saw a man come in with a bottle of red and glasses and he poured everyone at the kitchen a glass before settling down by himself with the rest of the bottle and a book. If it is BYOB I would be thrilled to bring a PBR next time to enjoy with my dogs.
1041,"I was just in Chicago for the weekend and I had a few things on my list to check out - a cubs game, the architectural boat tour and the aquarium. I also wanted to check out a few restaurants and then be sure to get in a Chicago dog and deep dish pizza. And the quest for that Chicago dog is what brought me to Hot Doug's. After seeing the Foie Gras Dog on TV, I knew I had to get that. After walking in, I noticed game of the week was Kangaroo... I'll make room for that. But wait, the celebrity of the day was Apple Pork Sausage? I'll get that too... and a side of duck fat fries as those are always good. All three hot dogs were amazing. The Foie Gras Dog blew out my expectations and easily surpassed its knockoffs at ""gourmet hot dog"" stands in Texas. The Kangaroo had that amazing gamey flavor and worked well with the heat from the jalapenos. The apple pork sausage was the right amount of savory and sweet. The duck fat fries were good too, but not the best I ever had. After leaving Hot Doug's in a almost drunken daze from the delicious array of encased meats, i realized that I failed my quest for a Chicago Dog. But at that point, I really didnt care... all three hot dogs I just ate were f*cking amazing."
1042,"Hot diggity Doug, how have I not reviewed this place before? Also, how many reviews do you think I could write in 2 hours and 15 minutes? Because that is the amount of time I stood in line for some specialty sausages and duck fat fries last weekend. With the plethora of minutes I had on hand, I did an assortment of things, including but not limited to: chatting with the folks in front of us in line, considering eating the string cheese and/or banana in my purse, thinking about whether or not I should get 1 sausage or 2 (2, obviously, as a reward for standing in line for so long and because who knows when I'll be back?), and stepping on the bf's shoes. Once inside, where I could fully investigate the menu, I chose the smoked duck sausage with red pepper mustard, olives, and cheese and cognac-infused lamb/pork sausage with fig goat butter and aged cheese. I liked the latter better, but overall, I thought both offerings could have been stronger in flavor, with the exception of the cheese. Upon approaching Doug at the counter, bf went with, ""I'll order the whole right side of the specials menu"". I wonder if Doug's heard that one before. And the duck fat fries were amazing, as usual! Since the last time I was here, an employee will find you a table by the time your food is ready. Woot! Note: this place is cash only."
1043,"I came here on a trip across the country on my way to move to California. We planned our whole trip to make sure we could stop here, and it was definitely worth it. To start off, the foie gras dog is one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was just perfect. I would happily wait in line again just for that first bite. I couldn't believe how good it was at first, seriously. I kept asking myself, ""Is this for real?"" We also got the Chicago Dog. It was good, but that was about it. It's not what we came for, but we just felt like we had to. The Irish Banger had one of the best pops of any sausage I've ever had, and it was delicious as well. The rattlesnake was fantastic. I never would have thought I'd have it as a sausage, but I'm damn glad I did. Finally the duck fat fries...I'm sorry, but I was slightly disappointed. Maybe it was me, but I didn't get much of the duck fat flavor. They were great fries, but I guess I was just expecting a stronger duck fat flavor, which is one of my favorites."
1044,"I love this place, even though I am not a fan of mixed meats. the foie gras hot dog is amazing, and bison, elk, alligator meats make it really interesting. Doug is also super nice and makes the whole place fun. However, the wait is brutal and unless you are really craving, you don't wanna wait up to an hour for food. but once you do reach the end of the line, you feel the need to get 10 hot dogs, seriously, and eat them all in one day, because they are that good!"
1045,"So when my Chicago Food Friend took me here he told me we'd probably have to wait. Boy was he serious. We were in line for almost two hours! The specialty dog I got was oh so good. Who knew one could enjoy a hot dog so much? The entire staff was so friends and not in a rush at all. (in a good way) I think the best part of the visit was the over all experience. So glad I went. Oh, and I'm pretty sure Doug was there."
1046,"For encased meats this is perfection and there are no finer establishments my friend. The Game of the Week is Innovative and can't be found elsewhere and yes its worth the wait, even in the cold when they run out after you've been waiting for 2.5 hours."
1047,"If you're wondering if the loooong line is worth the wait - DEFINITELY! Does anyone know what kind of veggie dogs they use here? They are huge! They actually fill up the whole (delicious) bun! Loved it. I got mine with the works (tomatoes, pickle spear, celery salt, carmelized onions, neon relish, mustard), plus sport peppers and some fries. Man, the fries are great! Skin on, crisp and salty, just the way I love them. Yes, I'm a vegetarian, and yes, I loved Hot Doug's so much that I bought a t-shirt that says ""there are no two finer words in the english language than 'encased meats', my friend."" And, the staff is SO NICE, even though the line is a million years long and they are non-stop busy! Hot Doug's is reason enough for me to visit Chicago again."
1048,"i freaking love this place and will go out of my way, rain or shine, to get my hot doug fix whenever i'm even in the vicinity of Chicago. nothing makes me happier than going to that little suburb and joining the line winding around the corner, because that means in just a short while i will be smacking my lips on a delicious foie gras dog and whatever other specials appeal to me. i've now been three times now. during my first visit, i had an unrivaled garlic pork dog that was bursting with flavor. today i sampled the rattlesnake dog, the pork n ale cheese dog, the sundried tomato and burrata dog, the lamb sausage and the swedish potato dog. other than the foie gras, i really liked the swedish potato. the only one i found somewhat was the lamb, as it was a bit dry, but overall any dog from hot doug is heads and tails better than its competitors. love the friendly, diner-like, casual feel and how doug mans the counter daily. and triple quadruple love the sausagefest!"
1049,"Worth the hype. One of the best eating experiences I've had in the city. Yeah, you gotta wait outside for about 20 minutes (we arrived right at noon), but it's part of the charm and well worth it. Doug himself takes your order once you get up there. He's funny and friendly and really wants you to enjoy his place. And you will. While they have hot dogs, Polish, and other standard hot dog stand fare, I suggest the specialty sausages. I got the Thai sausage and a spicy cheesy thing, and both blew me away. I wanted to actually try all of them, and will eventually go back to do so. Maybe not the best hot dog place in the city--the hot dogs are good but not special--but the specialty sausages are worth making the trip, waiting in line, and plucking the money down for. I wish I was there right now."
1050,"Wanna know why this place has almost 2,000 reviews and people keep reviewing it? Because when you eat it, you can't help but want to scream and shout and jump up and down about how freaking delicious it is!!! That's all that really needs to be said, I believe. Oh, and that Doug is awesome."
1051,"Changed my life. 1. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel Eat one.. even two before you die."
1052,"Hot Doug's is a one-of-a-kind place that has three elements in common with most successful businesses--identity, vision and leadership. Doug Sohn is a visionary leader who gave his business its profound identity right from the start. He makes no apology for its quirks and idiosyncrasies. Someone less visionary may have seen their business grow and said to themselves, ""Hey, I'm making a killing at this--maybe I'll... * ...take credit cards."" * ...stay open later."" * ...open on Sunday."" * ...hire friendly, talented people to 1) take food orders from my customers and 2) collect my money."" * ...open up a location at Navy Pier or O'Hare (or both) and take advantage of the tourist trade."" * ...franchise this thing and take advantage of everybody."" ""...do a Groupon."" Doug just does it his way, and it's always been his way. I do not want to intimate that, with the exception of the ""Groupon"" thing, any of the above observations are akin to soul-selling, but so many businesses have lost their way when attempting to grow and change. Hot Doug's has not made any of those changes hence, there has been no degradation. I have been to Hot Doug's a dozen or more times in the past five years. I have had char-grilled dogs, steamed dogs, polish, fois gras sausage, turducken sausage and other delights. It's not the cheapest place in town but I always get a good meal at a surprisingly good price and I never walk away hungry. To sum things up, I know I'm going to have to stand in line. I know I have to bring cash. I know there is a chance that Doug might be out of town and the place will be closed when I get there. That's just the way things are, and I'm ok with all of it. Thanks for being there, Doug."
1053,"Yes, I admitted that I had never been to Wurstkuche in LA, but I think Hot Doug's pretty much offer similar sausages, just different atmosphere. A lot of my Yelp buddies told me to go, so at temperature of less than 10degrees outside, my friend and I ventured to Avondale to get hot doug's and boy it was a great decision, a very short line, not even 30minutes wait - lucky for me, and parking was easy for us too. Here are the list of our dawgs for the two of us: - Foie gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur del Sel - best - The Atomic Bomb (Damn Spicy Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese - very good and crazy hot spicy, in a good way - Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri, St. Angel Triple Creme Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions - just okay - the Salma Hayek (formerly the Madonna, the Raquel Welch and the Ann-Margret) - Andouille Sausage with caramelized onions - the lowest price among all and still good. with regular small fries. For non-foodie, the Foie gras might not look so appealing, but just take a bite and you'd taste the yummy goodness of the duck and foie gras combined. If you're a fan of hot spicy sausage, take a bite of the Atomic bomb, you'd love it. The habanero-jack cheese might be too HOT for me, thank God I split that dawg with my friend, otherwise I don't think I would be able to finish that by myself. The Ribeye in my opinion didn't taste anything special, so I don't recommend getting that one. The Salma Hayek was written as hot, but actually it wasn't so bad, this is one of the regular dawgs you'd always see on the menu. The first 3 are the specials. Doug is usually at the cashier line writing up your order, very friendly guy, even tho the place is busy, he still jokes around with customers who are placing orders, which I think pretty nice, because some established places just thinking about ka-ching coming through the door. A couple of my friends were showing up as well and they ordered the duck fat fries, you could definitely taste the flavor of the fat in the fries, so different with the regular one and it's abit more greasy, but it's really good. Quicktip: Apparently, they also take vacation about 2 weeks in one day, and this time the day coincides with Valentine's day, so before you go, better check first if they're open that day. If I ever visit Chicago again, I will probably stop by. IN the mean time, I still have to try Wurstkutche to compare these exotic sausages."
1054,"Oftentimes we are bogged down in the dichotomy of overpriced ""high-end"" food, and dollar menu ""fast food,"" to the point where the middle ground is a hazy fog of bulk processed, frozen meals. Hot Doug's stands defiantly apart from the norm and takes one of the simplest and most iconic foods in America and bridges a gap between worlds. There is almost always a line, no matter what time of day, and no matter what day of the week. Anyone standing in that line will tell you that the wait is well worth it, and I couldn't agree more. The courteous and helpful staff are more than happy to make the experience as painless as possible despite the renowned wait times, and although the line may seem long, the staff makes sure it moves fairly quickly. How many different ways can you prepare and present a sausage/hot dog? Hasn't it all been done by now? Surely Hot Doug's response to that is, a resounding ""never!"" Their unique ""Specials"" menu and seemingly odd combinations of ingredients ensures that your first trip to Hot Doug's is memorable. And despite their popularity (or perhaps because of it), they continue to offer many of the classic varieties of sausage/hot dog for very reasonable prices. After Doug took my order, I was surprised at how easy it was to procure a place to sit considering how incredibly busy it was. The food was brought out promptly, and the Chicago dog was as good as it gets, but the real heroes are the Specials. The Chipotle Buffalo sausage with gouda cheese was certainly unique, and I heartily enjoyed every bite. Sure, the decor won't be winning any awards, the line looks a bit daunting, and I probably wouldn't eat here every day, but rest assured, the wondrously quirky food concoctions and friendly staff makes this a must-try experience for anyone in Chicago, whether they live there, or are just passing through."
1055,"I couldn't figure out why an encased meats joint with one hell of a line was a ""must try"" while I was in Chicago, until I saw their menu! It was actually impossible to choose just one. We decided on the turducken sausage with champagne pate, bacon sauce and blue cheese and the shrimp and pork sausage with remoulade and goat cheese- & cheese fries. I have never been so excited in my life for lunch! I ate in silence, MMMMing in extasy at every bite. Next time I must try the fois gras dog! As I walked to the bathroom, my girlfriend muttered ""take your phone"" ""UH to the bathroom? Why?,"" I said. ""Trust me, you'll want to take a photo,"" she said. Sadly, she was right. OK Chicago, you win the dog-race, but we NY'ers still own pizza!"
1056,"Doug always seems happy and ready to joke around with you, even as a 2 hour long line of customers is waiting, he never looks hurried or panicked. If he rushed people through he could probably make more money, or if he raised prices, stayed open later, etc. Doug doesn't seem concerned about maximizing profits. Actually, Doug doesn't seem concerned about anything aside from encased meats. I worry about him."
1057,"There's not a whole lot left to be said that hasn't been already. Quite possibly the best thing you will ever eat on (or even off) a bun. Hot Doug's is the best of the best when it comes to both classic and incredibly creative encased meats. Be prepared to wait (outside, even if it's cold), but know that the payoff is absolutely worth it. Duck fat fries on the weekend are not to be missed. A true experience and the best culinary bang for your buck in Chicago."
1058,"I don't need to tell you how awesome Hot Doug's is, because you already know. Even if you have never been there, you already know. The place has been reviewed over 1500 times, and I really don't think I need to throw my two-cents in. So... details that are good to know: I went on a Wednesday in March, and only waited in line for about 15 minutes. You can ONLY get duck fat fries on Friday and Saturday. Cash only, of course. That's it. Just go, go and enjoy."
1059,"Hot Doug is a lot of fun. Great food! Get the foie gras hot dog - it's unbelievably good. The owner is very friendly and warm - I forget his name. I personally believe the wait is worth it. What's not worth it is the duck fat fry. They only serve it, I believe, on weekends. The wait can be long - seriously long. So get there super-early. If you want to do lunch there, I advise you to get there by 10:30."
1060,"Hot damn, that Hot Doug's is delicious! I loved my fancy schmantzy dogs, the duck fat fries, the coke and even the freaking visit to the bathroom. It was just a great meal at a fair price and worth every penny. My favorite part was how welcome I felt - I am definitely the farthest thing from a hipster that exists. (Unless my actual generous sized hips would somehow count.) Yet, Doug and the whole ambience of the place made me feel happy I had come, welcome and hoping to return. Really cool hip places are usually not this ""retired school teacher friendly"" as evidenced by the next stop on our culinary journey today but that's a different review. The wait was only about 20 minutes on a Friday a bit before noon. Doug was super friendly and nonjudgmental and talked a bit about his upcoming voyage to France. He provides a really great vibe and an outstanding encased meat product. Bon voyage! Enjoy your trip to Paris, Doug, where le hotdog franais will not equal yours!"
1061,"Tried Hot Doug's for the first time last week. Wow! I've heard about it for a while now but never had a chance to make the trek to Avondale from Hyde Park in the middle of the day. Arrived at 3:30 and the line outside was ridiculously long but moved fairly fast. Unfortunately, we'd nearly made it to the front of the line when we realized it was cash only. But some extremely nice people standing in front of us overheard our conversation and offered to cover us. They were great! Allie and Tyler if you are reading this, THANK YOU again! We tried the Elvis, an amazing Polish sausage with everything on it, and the Paul Kelly, a beer soaked bratwurst w/ grilled onions. The wait was definitely worth it, and we had the privilege of meeting some really cool people in the process. I would definitely recommend Hot Doug's. Just get there early...and don't forget to BRING CASH!"
1062,"Yep, one of the best hot dog places ever!!! They have all kinds of weird sausages with all types of toppings but it's amazing!! There's always a wait, so go EARLY! I went there at 10:40 and we still had to wait 1.5 hours but it was definitely worth it. i would suggest getting one of their specials ordered 3 types of hot dogs and shared it with cheese fries. 1. Tequila, Black Bean and Lime Chicken Sausage with Sweet Jalapeno Mustard and Salsa-Jack Cheese - FILLED WITH FLAVOR AND SO JUICY 2. The Cheesy Atomic: Damn Spicy Jack Cheese-stuffed Pork Sausage with Spicy Passion Fruit Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese - VERY SPICY BUT DELICOUS 3. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel - GOOD, not too much taste like the others but i like foie gras so it was still good. i can't wait to come back and try other hot dogs, i'm willing to wait in that long ridiculous line."
1063,"Leap Day Miracle! My office closed early so I found myself with a weekday afternoon to myself, so boyfriend and I drove over and happily found NO LINE at Hot Doug's. I've been wanting to try this place for a while for but one reason or another, hadn't gotten to yet, so this was pretty great. I had the Irish banger (4-cheese mustard sauce with crispy fried onions) and some fries, he had a corn dog and Polish sausage. Mine was amazing, and he said his were ""hands down best in the city."" I want to go back on the weekend for the much-talked-about duck fat fries (and obviously more of the actual food because there were at least 3-4 other ones that looked good), but for a first try this place was A+ and the staff was really nice."
1064,"Yes, they serve exotic sausages with exotic toppings. They have some of the best fresh cut fries around, even without being fried in duck fat. The line is incredibly long, too long for the weak. We all know this. The previous 1448 reviews tell us so. Let me point out one detail. The employees here are so friggin friendly and upbeat it is downright thesis essay worthy. How and why are they so chipper? It should be a case study for the service industry."
1065,"I finally made my way to Hot Doug's! I've been staring at all these pictures of delicious gourmet hot dogs FOREVER. Since I had last week off, this was one of my first picks for lunch. Thank god I decided to stop by on a weekday. Our wait was less than 15 minutes and we were starving! The duck and foie gras hot dog was ... you know what, I can't even express in words right now how much I loved it. It was just ""mmmm ..."" I seriously thought about going back and buying a couple more just for dinner. I should have (dammit!). I just wish I had the stomach (and wallet) to sample them all. Doug was really awesome too. He takes all the orders himself. And in case you missed it in other reviews, it's cash only here!"
1066,"What kind of word do you want? Fantastic? Incredible? Outstanding? Intense? Place is the fire and worth every second of the wait. I had he Salma Hayek (Andouille) and the crayfish with smoked pork sausage. Duck fat fries. Every bite had me wanting more. So much flavor in both of them you can only understand through experience. Anytime I am in the area and have time to wait, I will come back. I waited about 3 hours before I ate the crayfish/smoked pork sausage and even room temperature with the cheese at it's plastic-most, it was still amazing. I can't wait to go back, I even sent the menu to my buddy in jail so he knows he has a special treat upon his return!"
1067,"Holy hell I had no idea that a Hot Dog could be so damn good. Waited probably 40 minutes on a Thursday. Doug took our order and he couldn't have been more welcoming and appreciative of the business. Ordered ""The Dog"" which is the standard chicago dog with all the fixins. Everything went well beautifully and was the perfect hot dog. Best Dog I have ever had. The Foie Gras Dog- Just plain insanity. Definitely the most decadent dog I have ever had. So rich and creamy and everything worked great together. So much flavor in every bite. Just delicious. French Fries- The fries here are damn good. Can't even imagine how good the duck fat fries are! Definitely check this place out. Great selection and great service for a very reasonable price. There is a reason there are so many good reviews."
1068,"The first time we went, the line was 1.5 hrs long, it was a Saturday and they were serving duck fat fries.... we didn't wait and moved on. We decided to try the place for lunch before we hit the road home. 11a on a Tuesday the line is out the door, but this time only a 20 min wait. Sara ordered the chicken sausage w/ spinach and mozzarella fries n drink, I ordered my first Chicago style dog and also skittishly ordered the ginger spiked rabbit sausage. The Chicken Sausage was good. The Chicago dog was surprisingly good- I wasn't sure I would like all the toppings on it, but they really go well together. The Rabbit Sausage was delicious-just a hint of ginger, the brie and roasted pepper sauces really brought it together."
1069,"I spent $44 in cash on 7 hot dogs, 2 pops and a cheese fry after waiting 45 minutes in line freezing my ass off. Would I do it again? You bet I would. Happily. I can't say that about ANYTHING. My world for a foie gras hot dog right now. Wins: 1. Curry dog - that cranberry chutney cheese on top of the curry dog makes for an amazing delicious surprising bite 2. Smoked knockwurst - it has cheese inside of the dog, I am drooling thinking about it 3. Atomic Bomb - the perfect dog for those who love a little spice in their life 4. Portobello swiss - mushrooms were perfect, swiss amazing sharpness 5. Creole spicy sausage - totally different kind of dog, more sausage like, very spicy with some amazing cheese sprinkled on top 6. Fries - total perfection, twice fried, perfectly salted -- amazing with cheese. SUPER wins (there are no fails at Hot Doug's): 1. Foie gras dog - I will need to get one every visit. Duck sausage with truffle and foie gras on top? Can something get more amazing? No. I want to eat this now. I want to die eating this. I want nothing more than this right now. 2. Duck confit dog - pork sausage with duck confit, a bit sweet, but completely perfect. 3. They have Diet Dr. Brown's Black Cherry -- the best diet soda to ever exist period. Doug -- you are a genius. Please send a foie gras dog to Detroit, kthnxbai. Officially on my Must Visit list for when I come to Sweet Home Chicago."
1070,"Hot Doug's was everything I thought and wanted it to be. The dry humor from Doug, the interesting selection of hot dogs, and the humorously themed sausage decor. Foie Gras dog was good but for $9 its one of those, I have to try it at least once in my life. I rather enjoyed the ribeye sausage with the fried onions, chimichurri, and red wine cheese. Line moves fast, service is fast, and you can get in and out rather quickly. The only con is the location which if you are taking public transportation can be a bit of a pain to get to but its so worth it if you are visiting Chicago."
1071,"Hot Doug's was worth the 45 minute wait. Four of us braved the misting rain for duck fat fries and specialty sausages. Highlights - I loved my Marty Allen (thuringer that I topped with mustard and kraut) and the Jamaican Jerk. I sampled everyone else's selections, and really liked the Keira Knightly, the Hungarian Pork, the Creole Bison and the Jack Daniels sausage. We ordered a foie gras dog and shared, and I have to say, I was not a fan. I normally really like foie gras, but this was just a little too much of everything. I didn't find it offensive, I just wouldn't order it again. My least favorite by a mile was the Curry. Yuck. I don't like curry though. Duck fat fries - this has been covered in a million reviews. Just get them."
1072,"THE BEST HOT DOGS I'VE EVER TRIED! HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S!!!!!! This place is awesome! Where in the world can you get all the gourmet hot dogs you can ask for? When I walked in after waiting outside for 15-20 mins and saw their menu, I was just BLOWN away. Spicy thai chicken hot dog? Stop it, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage? Really? Not really into livers but when I took a bite and the succulent duck sausage combined with foie gras was a perfect combination you can ask for. I nearly passed out! And Doug was super duper uber nice to pick up our check and thanked us for serving in the military. Serves gourmet dogs that are never seen anywhere and supports the military? I LOVE YOU DOUG! And let me tell you, all the shows I saw on food network doesn't do any justice, you have to go and try it out. Sometimes at night, I pray that I will move to the recruiting station across from lane tech prep because Hot Doug's only few blocks away..... But seriously, very good stuff. I would love to go there daily if I had the time!"
1073,"If I could eat here every day, I would. After getting up at 9am and riding over here, only three people were in front of us when the door opened at 10:30. The service here is EXTREMELY fast, mind you, so once you actually put your order in, you're usually out within 5-10 minutes. I ordered a corn dog and the duck sausage with foie gras, which I have been waiting over a year to try. Completely worth it. I can't even describe how tasty it was -- and as well, as a huge fan of corn dogs, this corn dog was one of the best made ones I've ever eaten. My boyfriend also ordered one of the brats (I think?) with jack daniels and gouda -- which was delicious and made me want to try making it at home. Overall, this place completely lives up to the hype and anyone who says otherwise is a hipster. So says I."
1074,"Damn, what a place. So far I've had to wait in line longer here than any other place I have been to in Chicago. Is it worth it? YES. Well, at least once in your life. Coming from texas, I never got to experience hot dogs outside of bbq style dogs. I was pretty happy trying a chicago style hot dog when I first moved here. Up until this point I was content with my hot dog experience.... until I went to hot doug's. They have all sorts of specialty dogs. Alligator, rattlesnake, etc etc.... it's mind blowing. They also had fries fried in duck fat!!!! I don't think any place in chicago offers what this place offers. People need to come here at least once in their chicago lives."
1075,All I have to say is BACON Hotdog! WOW!!! Best hotdog I've had in my life! yes my life! Chicago dog was kinda boring. The corn dog was YUMO! nice and crispy on the outside
1076,"My first visit to Hot Doug's and it did not disappoint. Waited about 20-30 minutes which seems to be pretty good when compared to other reviewers experiences. My nephew had an Uber sausage with Havarti cheese and I had a pecan roasted jalapeno flavored pork and chicken sausage. Both were very good. The chipotle sauce on mine was just right and the spiciness was hot, yet mild enough to enjoy the flavor and taste of the sausage. Next time I go, I'll likely order the small order of fries - one large order would have been fine for both of us. Friendly staff and the order took less than five minutes to make and serve. Thumbs up!"
1077,"Hot Doug's is very popular, and very small. That means the line is long, and is very often out the door. Even in the middle of winter. Here is my philosophy about waiting in line. If you are going to a place like Hot Doug's you probably know there is going to be a wait. And once you get there, you can plainly see there is a wait. Complain all you want until you get in line. Once you're there, shut up about it already. Anyway, once you get to the counter, you get greeted by Doug, who is very friendly and patient, even though you should have had ample opportunity to make up your mind before you get there. I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. Because I think if you can stomach foie gras ethically, physiologically, and psychologically, you're pretty much obliged to order it. I think it's always on the menu, but I'm not sure. It was encased meat nirvana, as you might expect. Other than the long line, super nice and enthusiastic proprietor, and heavenly encased meats, Hot Doug's is your basic kitschy hot dog stand. Open limited hours, so check before you go. Cash only. I'll be back, because Hot Doug's is worth the wait, unlike that heavy metal hamburger joint with the famously long wait."
1078,"ALL Hail the King! Doug Sohn the Emperor of Encased Meats. Wildly imaginative combinations that always work, step out of your comfort zone and live a little there are many non traditional Dogs that are just awesome. If its Friday get in line now for Duck Fat Fries! Yes the Waits can be very long but its a great opportunity to mingle with fellow Food lovers. If your not adventurous dont fear even the regular Hot Dog is excellent, I'm partial to the Hot Hot dog, thats a great combination I wish more places would pick up. Oh and Dont forget the Green River!"
1079,"I got in line at 1030am and waited in line a little over an hour. Would I do it again? Hell yeah. Duck fat fries, were delicious... although I'm not quite sure I'd be able to tell the difference besides in color. The Chicago dog at $1.75 was delicious and a steal. For our specialty sausages, we had 3 foie dogs, 1 rattlesnake, and one pork sausage. The foie dogs, at $9/ were a steal given the generous slices of foie on top... I was taking the smallest bites milking mine to the last bite... the rattlesnake sausage wasn't gamey at all and so good... tricked my mom into eating it, boy was she mad when she found out, haha. And the pork sausage with the cheese on top was also very good. I cannot wait to come back here when I'm back in Chicago. *****"
1080,"Recent pig-out consisted of us grubbing on the following: 5 orders of duck fat fries 1 order of the marty allen dog 2 orders of the [house original] dog 1 order of the keira knightley-fire dog 1 order of the spicy beef hot link coca-cola bbq & applewood smoked cheddar 1 order of the spicy smoked alligator sausage + cajun remoulade and smoked blue cheese 2 orders of foie gras and sauternes duck sausage + truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris 1 order of the three-chili wild boar sausage + chipotle dijonnaise and smoked cumin gouda cheese 1 order of the cherry-apple pork sausage + curry-lime mayonnaise, rum-soaked dried berries and roasted almonds Nothing has changed with Hot Doug's in the last few years. Dogs are still stellar, staff is still unbelievably friendly, it's still cash only, duck fat fries are still a greasy addiction only offered on Friday & Saturday, lines are still way down the block, and the buns still suck and offer nothing to counter the craziness that's piled onto each and every creation. I still go through the jot down on the imaginary yellow legal pad of pros and cons kinda thinking when figuring out of it's worth making the trek with the lack of a convenient CTA stop in the area and waiting in 1 1/2 hour line bombarded with tourists while locals are just trying to grab a yummy meal (no hate, I love you guys, thanks for loving our beautiful city!). And honestly, most of the time I vote against going to Hot Doug's strictly because of those 2 things -- inconvenient to get to unless you feel like driving and the unwillingness to wait in line. And it's not just any line. Every major spot that has got its 15-minutes-of-TV-fame has a line in this city. And it's just a little more difficult to calculate when the non-rush periods will be at Hot Doug's."
1081,"Link Meat...Encased Meat...Hot Dogs...Suss'eege(Italian way to say it), whatever you call it...Hot Doug's takes it to a whole new level. Mary and I wanted to scratch another Best of Hotdog place off our list! Day: cold as hell for May 14 in Chicago - 47degrees. Line: LONG at 10:20 in the Morning streched to the end of the building. Wait: 45 minutes plus! Conversation: with the couple in front of us...interesting, since we talked nothing but food the whole time and and comparing notes on great places to eat in the city. FOOD: Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Smoked Gouda Cheese (Mine) Pepper Jack Cheese- Stuffed Chicken Chorizo with Tomatillo Mole and Queso Asadero (her) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel (share) Antelope Sausage with 4-Cheese Dijonnaise and Roasted Red-Spicy Cherry Peppers (share) Duck Fat Fries The Eating Experience Service: awesome...fast and friendly once you actually got into the place. Price: lil on the steep side...when you think of hot dogs...you dont expect to toss down 39 bucks and change for 4 dogs...but for exotic dogs/meats like these they come at a price. Ranking: #1 Gator...nice and gamey..great spice fantastic smoked cheese flavor...worked well with the over taste. Loved it! #2 Chicken Chrizo jack cheese...perfect blend of spicy and mexican flavor...the mole was GOOD! # 3 Antelope Sausage...was a great combo! alot of black pepper flavor with good snap to the casing...really enjoyed it. #4 Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage ...it first this sounds over the top...who puts Foie Gras on a hotdog??? The taste to Me was very sweet...very rich...and the texture was a bit to mushy. Disapointing. Duck fat fries...was good...not greasy for hand cut..and hot when served. Conclusion: Great experience...would love do it again. Hot Doug's will forsure be in our TOP 5 hotdog places to eat in the City."
1082,"I don't want to reiterate what other people have already said, so the topic of my post will be: How to Optimize your Hot Doug's Experience. First of all, if you want duck fat fries, those are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, and on those days, there will always be a line. So it doesn't really matter when you come (unless you come before 10:30 when it opens?). Yes, people will still come when it's raining or snowing.. weather doesn't stop people in Chicago from carrying on as usual. Weird. Anyway, you know that ""Food Buddha"" show that the Sunda chef does? Well basically, in each episode, he goes to a restaurant and orders OOE -- ""One of Each"". This same approach should be used when ordering at Hot Doug's. Come with about 5-6 of your friends who are willing to share food and together, you can order one of each of the specials. Once you have all your food, people can try the ones that look appealing to them, and basically, everything on the menu looks good, so you'll probably want to try them all. I think I've liked most everything I tried -- but if you're not a big cheese person, you might have to remove some of it. They pile a LOT on each one."
1083,"great food, and truly unique variety. Super expansive menu and lots and lots of combos. And of course, Doug is happy to lend a helping hand if you are confused about the choices you wanna make. Would recommend you stay away from the fries. Not that they are bad or anything, just keep more room for the dogs :)"
1084,"I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but I will admit that I enjoyed my fare at the infamous Hot Doug's! I came for a late lunch on a weekday, so there was no line outside. We waited maybe 10 minutes to give our order and less than 5 for our food. My husband had the foie gras duck sausage and I had the onion and cheddar pork sausage with caramelized onions and garlic cheese. We also split a large cheese fry - duck fat fries only on Fri and Sat! The food was very good, but not out of this world. The portions seemed small at first, but we were definitely full for a long time. My sausage was very moist and tasty, but came with a little too much cheese. Overall, our only complaints were that it was a little pricey and cash only. While I wouldn't mind returning to try other menu items, I don't know that I'd wait in a long line outside..."
1085,"After being in line for an hour on a Friday afternoon, I ordered the duck sausage and foie dog and it was very very good. My only complain is that the size on the small side; one hot dog barely fills me up. Just be careful because a couple of premium dogs, duck fat fries, and fries can easily add up."
1086,"Popping my Yelp cherry with a review about sausages. Sounds about right. Yes, you will wait in line, sometimes for up to two hours. If you have a problem with that, don't come here. If you don't, the prepare for some deliciousness in the form of encased meat on a bun. I've had more sausages here than I should probably be willing to admit, but I'm not afraid to say it: My name is Ashley K. and I am a Hot Doug's addict. My absolute favorite dog is the Portuguese linguica. Doug changes up the toppings on it from time to time but it's usually a saffron aioli/rouille and topped with a mild, creamy cheese. Heaven on a bun. All of the pork sausages are generally fantastic. The chicken sausages are a bit more hit or miss for me. The steak chimichurri is superb, as is the Teuben (reuben in hot dog form). I have yet to try the famous foie gras sausage, as I'm not a huge fan of foie gras in the first place. And the duck fat fries, oh the fries, if I weren't trying to fit into my wedding dress in 2 months (or live past 30), I would eat you every day. Hot Dougs may ""only"" be a hot dog joint, but Doug elevates them above and beyond your typical hot dog. Doug puts such attention to detail into his dogs, and I really appreciate the different flavors that he brings together. Doug is always at the counter, taking orders and conversing with customers. He doesn't need to do that - but he does. And that says a lot to me about how much he appreciates the business that comes in to Hot Dougs. And, there you have it folks. Review number 1, in the books."
1087,"Amaaazzzing! I can't stop waiving about this place. It's a shabby little place in a shabby little neighborhood. From downtown, it's about a $20 cab ride. If you ask me, that's worth it for A quality hot dogs. The bf got 3 hotdogs for himself. I forget the names and all were very good and juicy. The service was quick and the manager was very nice and sweet. We came here on a weekday so we didn't get to try the duck fat fries (avail Fri&Sat ONLY). Oh well, more reasons to come back to Chi town. I ordered the foie gras duck hot dog with white truffle aioli. It's about 3x the cost of the other hot dogs which are about $2-3 each but it is so worth it. The foie gras was not seared, which disappointed me at first. However, after one bite of the dog and I knew why. When the foie gras is seared, the texture of it becomes a little firmer and therefore, does not melt in your mouth as quickly. By not searing it, you are ensuring that the foie gras melt in your melt with the juice of the duck sausage. With the addition of the truffle aioli, the combination is just superb. AHHHH, what a superb combination. I wished LA had something like this. I've said it once and I'm not afraid to say it again. The foie gras hot dog with the duck sausage and white truffle aioli is the best hot dog I've ever had. Hands down. A friendly reminder - this place is cash only. Not sure if they have an ATM machine, but bring lots of cash! You'll want 2nds! Very friendly service. A little smelly though, from the grease. All worth it for the best hot dog I've ever had."
1088,"I've been coming to this place since it was in its old location and not clogged with hipsters lined around the building. My brother used to live in the neighborhood and how he didn't end up weighing 500 pounds, I'll never know. I think his old room-mate still works there. I've had so many of the offerings, it's hard to pick my favorite. The basics are amazing, just a plain Chicago-style dog, polish sausage or corn dog - they are all perfect. And the fries are always spot-on. When it comes to the more exotic dogs, I've had antelope, duck, rabbit, dogs topped with foie gras, corned beef dogs, the list goes on and on. Always with amazing and inventive toppings. Doug himself is as much a part of the institution as the food. Always quick to quip and keep the rabble in line, he clearly knows how he wants things to run and is in control of the situation. I made the mistake of ordering two orders of duck fries on my first visit and he told me 'no'. I thought he was kidding. He was not. My brother then explained that each order took like 20 minutes to cook, so I was being a tool and screwing over everyone else. Best damn frites I've ever had. Also, cash only."
1089,"The standard Chicago style hot dog was great, especially the relish. Fries were good as well. Their specialties, not so much. The foie gras dog was lukewarm, soggy, and plain unappetizing. Service was speedy. Overall, not worth the 45 minute wait in the freezing cold for this. I would imagine the wait is even longer during the summer."
1090,"The best freak'n hot dog restaurant in the country, hands down, one of the coolest places i've been to, and its all really affordable. Make sure you come with plenty of room to be able to try atleast 2 or three, I had the foie gras, atomic dog, truffel infused dog, salma hyeck loaded with all the chicago hot dog regualrs, if you gotta ask what those are you need to get experienced my friend. Yes this is one of the coolest place to eat in the country let along chicago. oh yeah, only down side is their hours, only open till 4pm, and closed on mondays i think...24 hours doug, and you'd be a billionare...."
1091,"Most definitely worth the wait here. Come here @ 10am and presumably the line wil be shorter but the place does a really good job at getting people in and out and getting you seated. Now off to the dogs! Menu is very expansive and you can get everything from a $1.50 regular chicago dog to an expensive and quality $8 dog. And yes, the fries in duck fat are phenomenal. I highly recommend checking out Hot Doug's for some hot doug action"
1092,"Great food. I was tempted to try some of the unconventional dogs, but I went with the Norm Crosby. Full of flavor and perfectly cooked. Fries were good too. I have to try some of the daily creations. Can't go wrong with Hot Doug's"
1093,"Have you ever had high expectations for a place, because they have one special item that people just rave about? And then have you ever tried that one special item and wondered what the hype was about? Well, wifey and I stood in line for an hour at Hot Doug's because we heard the duck fat fries were phenomenal. When we sat down and got our fries, we were both underwhelmed. There was nothing different about duck fat fries that we could taste. We also tried the Kiera Knightly dog, which was pretty good and spicy, and the normal hot dog, which was just okay. The highlight of our visit was Doug himself taking our order, and he was genuinely nice and funny man. I'm glad we got to experience the place once, but it's not a place I'd need to experience again."
1094,"Doug is awesome, seemed like a great guy, and the dogs are great, and I would go here more if I lived closer, BUT... Can someone tell me why you would wait 2 hours for this??? IS YOU CRAZY? It's fries (yes, fried in duck fat some days-Awesome) and hot dogs, people. This is like getting up at 3AM on Black Friday to get a $25 DVD player and save $2 on Blurays at Best Buy. Perhaps I'm in the minority here... Visitors to Chicago, Hot Dougs is great, so if you want to blow your entire day waiting for hot dogs, then have a great time! Come visit our fair city again soon!"
1095,We waited 2.5 hours for this...in the rain....and it was AMAZING!!!!! The fries were very heavy...but you could not stop eating! the Foie Gras was the best! it was O face all the way to the last bite!
1096,"I was in Chicago for the weekend, and what was on my list of to-do? HOT DOUG'S! We arrived at about 10:30 am on a Saturday and we were stoked to see how short the line was! While waiting in line, we were anxious to try what we have heard so much about. While waiting, we were deciding what to get. So many different choices, and if it were up to me, I would've wanted to order everything off the menu and have a bite of each. However, that didn't happen! Doug took our order, and something about having the owner of the establishment working the counter every day the place is open makes the place even better! We ordered the Salma Hayek, the Marty Allen, Foie Gras, the Steak Hot Dog, the Keira Knightley, 2 corn dogs, and an order of duck fat fries to share amongst 4 people. Yes! It was a lot of weiners! All of them had great distinct flavors as described on the menu, and they were all good in their own ways. I am a fan of Foie Gras, but I personally did not like the Foie Gras hot dog. It was loaded with Foie Gras, but something about paying $6 for so much foie gras really turned me off. Weird to say, but my favorite thing out of everything we ordered would have to be the CORN DOGS! They were sooo good! Everything from the batter to the hot dog. It was the best corn dog I have ever had! Hot Doug's lived up to the hype!"
1097,"Got there early expecting a crazy line, but it wasn't bad at all. About 20 minutes. Got to the counter and Doug was there taking the order. He's a super friendly guy and you can tell he cares about his business. All of the workers there were also super friendly and kept the place tic tocking along like a well-oiled machine. As for the food, we tried a bunch of options. Duck fat fries - meh. Maybe I was expecting too much since they're so hyped? Side note if you try them - it's a pretty big portion. Easily shared by 2. -Chicago style hot dog - was just okay in comparison to other hot dog places. -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli - ok but forgettable -Cognac-infused lamb and pork sausage with fig goat butter and centenol cheese - again, just okay. No specific flavors were jumping out on my tongue in joy. -Favorite of everyone I was with by far was a sausage that had Vosges bacon chocolate on it. Funny enough we ordered it for a friend who was late and ended up eating it. SUPER glad we stole her food because it was the saving grace of the sausages. Since the line was short we went back through again when she finally arrived. Unfortunately I don't see it on their menu anymore... I really, really, really wanted to love Hot Dougs. And based on the friendliness of the staff alone I will most likely go back and continue to try their crazy concoctions. But I feel like this place is over-hyped. It has cool menu items, but I didn't find the flavors to be as exciting as they sound. :("
1098,"I'M GOING TO FIND AND KILL ANYONE WHO DIDNT GIVE THIS PLACE 5 STARS. really, i think thats enough of a review, everyone else has beat me to it. No Doug sorry I dont have any new celebrity sitings. My only reason for visiting Chicago (ok and visiting my parents, but I think I've been to Hot Dougs more times than I've been to my parents house)"
1099,"Visited Chicago from LA for the Weekend and had to try the famous HOT DOUG! This place has a long wait, but if you go early as 10:30am there isnt much of a wait. most may not be up for hot dogs that early in the day, but if you truely are a Foodie, and even though youve been up partying since 5 am, you'd still get yourself up and on your way to try this famous hot dog joint! Ok ok, i tried their foi gras, atomic bomb, corn dog, salme hayke, and their duck fat fries! MmmmMmm.. all of it just about all was really good. I do have to say i do prefer the more traditional tasting hot dogs more, and for some reason their corn dogs were super amazing. its only a $1.50 too! Everyone should try their corn dogs. Their duck fat fries, didnt taste s"
1100,"I waited in line for 88 minutes. I spent roughly $28 on duck fat fries, & hot dogs. I would do it again in a heartbeat. Go to Hot Doug's, bring a friend, enjoy the wait, and savor the encased meats."
1101,"I came from California. This is the hot dog of awesomeness! The line is long and definitely worth it! I enjoyed ""The Dog"" and an Italian sausage. Best ever. Waited on by Doug, a friendly dude if ever I met one! I was told never to ask for ketchup on the ""The Dog"" or injuries might happen! I didn't ask for ketchup, and now I am a happy man!"
1102,"Here's what you need to know: It's all about exquisite encased meats on hot dog rolls here, excellent speedy service, and awful awful lines on the days you might actually be free to go. Thing is, unlike the slightly brusque attitude over at Kumas - another local legend and barely blocks away - you feel respected here. All smiles, all funny quips and no oppressive music. Feel good and enjoy! I guess it's because - let's face it - a hot dog is an American childhood comfort food. If you grew up here, and even if you're from a different culture at some point you were likely exposed to encased meats in extruded form, served on a bun. What Doug Sohn has done here is capture the honesty of youthful pleasure, and embue it with a decidedly adult twist in the greatest Chicago fashion. Remember, these are just hot dogs, sausages and linked meats so you aren't going to rival a trendy new american West Loop joint with food here. What you are going to rival though are your most cherished childhood memories of picnics, afterschool snacks and family/friend/team bbqs. I had the pleasure of the apple cherry pork sausage with Voges bacon chocolate and pear dijon mustard, and I swear I can't find a memory as good as this tasted!"
1103,"Who cares if I have a wedding to go to next weekend and need to fit into a dress? After waiting in line for what seemed like the shortest 60 minutes ever, you better believe that I will take advantage of finally being able to order. So therefore...between the two of us, we ordered the Dog (Chicago-style), the Jack and Alec Krienen (Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Caraway Havarti Cheese), the Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Chive-Dijon Goat's Butter and Duck Rillettes, the Duck Fat Fries, and of course, the famed Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. The Chicago-Style was just as expected. Chargrilled, plump, and simple. Much better than Weiner Circle's. Duh. The Celebrity sausage of the day, the Jack & Alec Krienen was indulgently delicious with its shrimp remoulade and semi melted cubes of caraway havarti cheese....what a genius combination of flavors. The cognac-infused pheasant sausage with duck rillettes...what can go wrong with that dog? Absolutely nothing. It's perfect. Duck Fat fries. Well, I wish I had ordered a side of normal fries just to compare the flavors. While they were super yummy, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between the two I think. Still, it's the perfect complement to all of these hot dogs. My boyfriend wanted to order the Foie dog for himself. Like the entire one. For. Himself. I thought he was insane (I'm just kidding love!) for thinking that he'd be able to finish the entire thing of rich truffley heart attack in a bun goodness by himself. I stole two bites and while it was everything I had imagined it to be and more, I absolutely could not have eaten the whole thing by myself. After finishing EVERYTHING in sight, we both felt pretty guilty for eating such a meal. I shouldn't be surprised if the zipper breaks on my dress next weekend. You know what though? Totally worth it."
1104,"I absolutely love this place. I'm not sure what began my undying affection for encased meats, but Hot Doug's takes my love to some sort of impossible perversion that makes me want to go back again and again. The last time I was there with my lady we tried 4 dogs, the foie gras (insanely good,) a chicken chorizo topped with Mole, a rattlesnake dog with a prickley pear raita (kind of tasted like a gyro, but better) and a lamb sausage with harissa, which was pretty good as well. My only issue with Doug's is that its seemingly impossible to choose what to get because, in addition to they're evderyday menu, they have specialty dogs that all sound awesome. If you show up at the right time, the line is almost non-existant, but if you assume that by showing up at 1 on a saturday that there'll be no line, you'll be sorely mistaken."
1105,Waited in the rain for duck fries and brats.... definitely worth every minute. Very reasonable prices and great food!
1106,"Best french fries and sausages in Chicago. Go on the weekend for duck fat fries, they are a life changing experience. Get there early or wait in line (totally worth it). The different hot dog's have fun names and the place is filled with funny commentary on the history of encased meat. You must go here if you are in Chicago. The only downside to this place is that it is cash only."
1107,"I'm gonna have to give this place 5 stars among hot dogs. They simply sell the best hotdogs I've ever tasted (Portillo's a close 2nd). I had the Salma Hayek (it's not spicy lol), The Dog (original Chicago style hot dog) and the Paul Kelly (soaked in beer). They're all very delicious!!! Btw, they also have Foie Gras on the hot dogs and Duck Fat Fries that you guys should try. Don't come Sunday!!! We came there once just to see a sign in the door that says ""We're closed on Sundays"" lol..."
1108,"So I went to Hot Doug's twice and so far the second time has gotten better. If you going to wait 45 plus minutes in line, make sure you have cash since they don't accept credit cards. Also, you have to get the specialty dogs like the foie gras or alligator dog or the other 6 dollar plus because the 3 dollar dogs taste like most other Chicago dog's which are good but not worth waiting 45 minutes. The alligator dog with bleu cheese was pretty awesome. 5 dogs with fries and 2 drinks cost about $40US."
1109,"I like to start off by saying Doug, the owner, was a pretty cool friendly down to earth guy. Doug takes everyone's order and reguardless of the looong line out side the door he takes his time with you while you order. As I visited Chicago my friends took me to eat at Hot Doug's on a Friday because I was told I had to try the Duck Fat Fries and boy were they delicious!! We all got something different and we were not disappointed in the least. This place is a must go to when visiting Chicago, it's kinda small for all the people who do go in and out of there but it just works, take my word for it. And as for the long wait in line, well it's just part of the experience, just be prepared. Can't wait to go back and enjoy some more good eats!!"
1110,"Here's the lowdown on Hot Doug's. Live it and preach it, my friends. Skip the weekend mecca. The lines are too long and the duck fat fries are overrated - there, I said it! Simply put, they are not sufficiently different in flavor from regular fries to justify the longer lines. If you want great tasting fries in exotic animal fat, go to Longman & Eagle any day of the week and get the beef tallow fries. That, my friends, is flavor. Instead, take a weekday off; I recommend Wednesday to bisect the workaday grind. Order a duck sausage dolloped in foie gras butter; not simply because such an order was briefly illegal, but because it is DELICIOUS. The gorgeous flavor comes mostly from the Sauternes sauce, which provides a sweet balance to the smokiness of the duck. Skip the fries completely and choose a second game sausage - the buffalo and elk combination with cheddar cheese is an excellent choice if Doug has it on the menu. But any random wild animal will do. Consume said sausages with a root beer, and go home for a well deserved afternoon nap. Wake up and get game at Longman & Eagle or RevBrew. Rinse and repeat. America, what a country!"
1111,"Foie gras duck sausage hot dog + Duck fat fries = Winner! I must admit the line here is pretty darn long but it's worth the wait! once you get in the service is excellent and I had the pleasure of meeting Doug himself. Since you're going to wait a little, I recommend getting at least 2 dogs. The Foie Dog is pretty rich a a tad drier then I'd like, but satisfying never the less. I tried another dog as well but I forgot the name. As a whole I'll def come back if I'm in town and was a very unique and pleasurable experience. Enjoy!"
1112,"Let me just say this.... This is by far, hands down the best freaking hot dog I've ever had. Really, I would stand in line for this for another two hours in 30 degree weather if I had to. I ate my way through Chicago and this hot dog was the highlight!! I got in just before closing and Doug was there to wait on me with a smile and friendly service just like his day had just started. What do I recommend? Go early, order several dogs and sample away. And if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they are serving duck fat fries, get two orders. They are yummy! Hot Doug's is not somewhere you want to miss. Go, Eat, Enjoy...... You won't be sorry!!"
1113,"There's few places in the world that make me as happy as Hot Doug's. Here's a guy who truly seems to be doing what he loves, and he's doing it so well that he seems to be really making it into a lifestyle business. More power to him. Classic dogs are amongst the best in the city, and I live for the foie dog, which is about the most luscious thing I can imagine. Don't even get me started on the duck fat fries. If only I could find a way around lining up..."
1114,"It is worth the wait. It doesn't matter if it's 30 min or an hour and a half. Just deal with it and wait! Complainers go home. I'm not sure why anyone would go there to get a Chicago style dog. You can get that anywhere. Live a little!! Try a fancy one! I love the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel!! Mmmmmmm! The duck fat fries are great and a good old fashioned corn dog with cheese on the side is the shiz."
1115,"Best. Hot Dog. Place. EVER. Seriously. This is the best hot dog joint I have ever been to. And like every other kid who grew up in America, of course I'm an expert on hot dogs. I got here a little after 11:00 right before the lunch rush. Good thing as the line goes out the door to the sidewalk during this rush. Doug's serves about a dozen kinds of hot dogs on their menu. The 1st one being the original Chi-Town dog with or without everything. 'Everything' being what your normally find on a Chi-Town dog. $1.75 just for this. Seriously, I really think this is reasonable. I mean, come in, get two dogs and a small drink and your lunch is less than $5. And definitely get only the small drink as it's free re-fills. Doug himself actually tells me this at the bar when I order. And on top of this, you can have your dog prepared different ways. I mean not just the original steamed way, but also grilled, deep fried, and deep fried and then grilled! A true sign of specialty in hot dogs. So I'm getting really excited just standing in line looking at all the other dogs (polish, some kind of spicy dog, some kind of spicier dog, corn dog etc.) when I notice a smaller menu on the wall. Their specialty dogs for the day. I'm guessing this menu changes a bit week to week. But holy! I'm reading this menu and I'm thinking, seriously? Maybe I just died outside in a car accident and fell into hot dog heaven. 'Cause this menu has got dogs for $7-8 but one of them is duck sausage (in a dog bun) with foie gras. Another is antelope sausage with a specialty mustard and sweet peppers. So when I get to the counter I ask Doug (who takes the orders) whether all that meat is 100%. Meaning is the antelope 100% antelope meat? He tells me some of them are, some of them aren't. The antelope is. I order one. How about the pheasant? Is this 100% pheasant? The pheasant is. I order one. How about the duck? Is this 100% duck? The duck is. I order one. Seriously, I order these three dogs plus an OG Chi-Town dog, grilled. And Doug is really nice. I tell him I'm really excited and he laughs and thanks me. The only problem with this place is that it's CASH only. Surprising considering how much traffic they get, I'm pretty sure their profits could offset the credit card fees. I grab a small table that fits two and see all sorts of people in this place. From kids and moms to college kids to me! My order comes and I chow down. I mean, these dogs are really, really good. Because I've never head pheasant, duck nor antelope in sausage form, I almost want to eat these outside of their hot dog form. To get the raw taste of these. But I chow it all down. The specific ingredients served and made with the specialty dogs are designed to enhance the taste of the specific meat. In some cases it didn't quite work out well (like the pheasant) but in some cases in absolutely did (like the duck). Still, to get exotic meat like this you really gotta look hard. And even then there's no success you'll find anything like this. Outstanding. A place like this almost makes me want to move to Chicago."
1116,"A few weeks ago the BF and I happened to be off of work during the week and we thought, ""Hey, Let's check out that Hot Dougs place"". It was a Wednesday around noon, so sadly, no duck fat fries. I had Antelope Sausage with 4-Cheese Dijonnaise and Roasted Red-Spicy Cherry Peppers and he had the Rabbit with Brie. I was also delighted to find that they had bottles of Sioux City Birch Beer, my favorite soda. (I kinda wanted to try the chocolate mint soda, but decided to save that for next time, when we go back for the duck fat fries.) Still the wait wasn't too bad (25min) and I'd definitely go back there again, dragging some friends. What also impressed me is that the plain ol' hotdogs were VERY reasonable, so if you don't dig oddball stuff in your tubesteak, you can still enjoy the food. Word to the wise...they don't take credit cards!"
1117,"On the second attempt waiting at Hot Doug, I finally got my fix and understood why people waited 1 hr to 1.5 hrs even in the rain and cold!We got there around 11:30am on a Saturday and found this line around the block to the end of the fence. Believe it or not, from the fence, it will be an hour wait at least. Despite the long wait in the cold and drizzle, I was wowed by the simplicity of the hot dogs and the taste in the sausage itself. We ordered the Chicago Style Hot Dog and the Paul Kelly. We decided that we can judge how good the hot dog is by just sticking to the originals and not trying to figure out the specials. The Hot Dogs had pickles, mustard - the works. The bun was extremely soft and slightly sweet. We also ordered the duck fat fries, which was surprisingly not that oily and had a slightly duck taste that doesn't overpower the fries itself. I would recommend to go before the store even opens because I am sure there will be a line even then."
1118,"Yes, it wa an adventure not just lunch. Hower a 5 star adventure. Took Blue line from downtown chicago. However you have to catch a cab from there. Good luck in the middle of nowhere. However we found one. Paid him an extra $20 to come back in an hour and pick us up. Only 15 people in line on a rainy monday! After we got there line quickly wrapped around the building. 50 min later we order. Rattlesnake sausage Duck and Foie Sausage, chicago dog and fries **Duck fat fries only on fridays and saturdays***BEWARE*** so we have just enough time to cram ourselves in the cab at 1:15 knowing we have a 2:30 flight back to DC. Best hot dog ever, Best sausages ever. Well worth the tummy ache as we ran through the airport to only find that our flight was delayed. Wait in 90 degree heat: 45 min. Cost of meal: 45.00. Cab ride to eat hot dogs 27.00.. The feeling of getting to try Hot Dougs before leaving chicago? Priceless......."
1119,The dogs get 5 stars. Doug himself gets 6!
1120,"I'm a vegetarian so of course I was not the best judge of a place such as this, however, what I did have, the veggie dog and the fries were great! My husband who is not a vegetarian had the hot dogs and said they were terrific as well. 5 star rating, not sure about that but for sure a 4 star. It was really cold the day we came and we got in line right when they opened and waited about 25-30 min which we were told was SUPER FAST. CASH ONLY so beware, you probably want to bring at least $15/pp. I have to say that we got the duck fat fries and the regular and could not taste the big difference. Fries are HUGE so even if you're super SUPER hungry, you can share an order. VERY FRIENDLY STAFF!!! If you're a hot dog lover, you can't miss this place, def. must try it out."
1121,"Visiting Illinois for the week but only a few hours in Chicago so we decided to stop by Hot Dougs for a late lunch since there were so many great reviews on yelp. We went on a Tuesday afternoon around 2 ish so it wasn't super busy. The restaurant is located on a corner and it was basically street parking. We got lucky and found a spot right in front. Between the 4 of us we ordered 2 Chicago hot dogs, 1 Elvis Polish Sausage, 1 Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, 2 Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Trugole Cheese, and a large fries. My favorite was the alligator! It was the game of the week and my first time trying alligator...eek! But it was actually really good. Too bad we warent here on a Friday or Saturday b/c those duck fat fries sounds delish! Between Hot Dougs and Pinks Hot Dogs in Los Angeles, Hot Dougs is definitely more unique! Where else can you find alligator sausage hot dogs?"
1122,"This last Saturday was a terrible day to wait in line for an hour, but we did. Here's what we got from good to best: duck fat fries: Just okay. The best ""cooked in alternative fat"" fries I've had are still the beef tallow fries from Sweet and Savories. Those were something special, these were a little too soggy for me and not flavorful or salted enough. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel: Okay but the foie gras overpowered the other flavors. Once we took some of it off, it all went together better. Lamb and Pork Loukaniko with Artichoke Pesto, Kalamata Olives, Marinated Feta Cheese and Lemon-Dijon Foam: Great flavors and wonderfully salted - the feta was wonderful. Sally Vega (corn dog): I had no idea that a corn dog could be this good. Amazing. Chardonnay and Jalapeno Rattlesnake Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Dijonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese: Yowza. I highly recommend this, a perfect combination of flavors. Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Mustard and Vosges Bacon Chocolate: A dessert hot dog? Well, it works! There were three of us and this was more than enough food. We shared bites of each - never thought I'd eat hot dogs tapas style! Their customer service, from Doug taking your order to the guys that bus the tables, is excellent. The only complaint that I have is that towards the end of your meal you mouth gets tired from eating all those buns. The only solution would be to come here more often and get just one or two each time ... but the line makes that a bit more difficult to deal with!"
1123,"Not a whole lot to add. We waited between an hour and a half and two hours on a mid-June Friday afternoon. Was the food and the experience worth it? Yes, I enjoyed the dogs. And talking to people in line was a good experience. Would I do it again? No, but I'm glad I did. It was a cool Chicago experience."
1124,"What more is there to say...I stood in line for an hour in November (and I'm from California now...it was COLD), ran down the street to the nearest ATM for cash, just to sample these sausages. And it was worth it. Yummy ""encased meats"". Friendly folks. Mama Marie and i shared like 4 of them. Go with a friend, try lots. It's delicious."
1125,"yay so glad i finally made it to hot doug's! it doesn't need another review but i'm going to write one anyway. had the foie gras duck sausage; the rattlesnake sausage with raita; the apple, pear, and port elk sausage; the corn dog; and duck fat fries. everything was delicious! the foie gras duck sausage is the one. it was so good and flavorful and every part of it filled my mouth with delicious creaminess. duck fat fries were great - not too different from regular fries, but again, the creaminess. corn dog was the second best i've had in my life. i was scared this place was over-hyped but it's not. it's just that great. and the best part is that the guy taking orders, i can only assume and wish it was hot doug himself, was the nicest guy in the world! the other people working there were pretty great too though. kind of a perfect experience."
1126,"sun-dried tomato and basil pork sausage with pesto aioli and burrata cheese ginger-spiked rabbit sausage with pumpkin creme fraiche and goat cheese the cheesy atomic: damn spicy jack cheese-stuffed pork sausage with spicy passion fruit mayonnaise and habanero-jack cheese spicy thai chicken sausage with sriracha mustard and sesame-seaweed salad lamb gyro (the description has completely escaped my mind) duck fat fries one of the many ""must-try"" establishments on an ever growing list i was glad to finally scratch this one off. lucky for us, the wait was 55 minutes outside on an atypical 50 degree january afternoon. inside, much more warmth is greeted along with the classic friendly chicago demeanor ready to chat up with each individual customer upbeat conversation intermittently laced with a full smile. order your food then proceed to obtain a table you would doubt this method but it works hence their strict adherence to the policy. wide variety of flavors packed up in sausages sweet, savory, unique, spicy, weird various types of meats are available for the traditional to adventurous. too much flavor to write. just go yourself."
1127,"Seriously Yelp, how many of us is it gonna take to get Hot Doug's rating from 4,5 to 5 star?! Best French fries in town, and of course best hot dogs. Expensive, but so worth it. I love you Doug!"
1128,"BRING CASH!!!! While waiting in line for 2 hours I had this funny feeling, like I was forgetting something or just this nagging feeling that I couldn't put my finger on. Then when I got to just about the door I started thinking about my past experiences of dining in the city and how they only take cash at some places. Surely, I thought with this place being so famous they must take credit/debit cards... or I hoped at this point in line that they did. Now it could be all my fault, perhaps there was a sign? idk... then I take full credit for being a tard. But they didn't even have an ATM machine, really? Which got me to thinking, I cannot be the only person to have done this. I wonder who else had waited in line for hours only to find out they must wait all over again. All that aside, my friends were able to hook me up and I was super excited to try the duck fat fries....wah wah, yeah... limp and soggyish and not really any different than some other fries I've tasted before. I had one of the specials and it was pretty good, but didn't wow me like I had anticipated with all the hype. Overall really disappointed."
1129,You have to taste one to believe it. They are delicious and they are worth the wait. But don't go hungry bc it's going to take awhile.
1130,"Ok, my husband and I went here about a year ago...right after we got married. And we went today - the day before our one year wedding anniversary. I have a feeling that this will be our anniversary place. This was our first experience of the duck fat fries. I'm very glad we shared an order...while I wanted to eat them all myself because they were soooooooo good, I felt my arteries clogging with each bite. Probably the best fries I've eaten. My husband ordered the Mauricio Umansky - Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Saint Angel Cheese. HELLO BACON SAUSAGE! Bacon encased meat? A piece of heaven on California Avenue. The Saint Angel cheese...it was like a richer, creamier, more divine camembert cheese. I had the Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Mustard and Vosges Bacon Chocolate. VOSGES BACON CHOCOLATE ON my sausage. Sounds strange, but it works incredibly well. Oh, and, as always, all the people that work here are incredibly friendly. I might get cranky working here because I'd want to eat everything that everyone ordered. Well done, Hot Doug's. Well done. I hope to see you again soon. But, if I don't, I'll see you for our second anniversary."
1131,"YUM YUM YUM! I went to visit a friend in Chicago and she said we had to try this place out. We were going on a Saturday and we were prepared for a long line, but since it was snowy and cold we thought the line wouldn't be terrible. WRONG. We waited in line for at least 40 min in the freezing cold. We made some friends in the process which made it much more bearable. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we got the Foie Gras, The Mountain Man, and the Pork and Duck Confit Sausage. And of course we got an order of the duck fat fries. Everything was really really good. I was afraid the blackberry mustard on the Mountain Man would make it too sweet but it was perfect. The Foie Gras was amazing and creamy. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries...but those were also good. I was impressed by the seating system they had. They ask you to not sit down until you've actually ordered which works out well because with all the people there everyone is always able to find a table. The staff was really nice and I'm sure they have a sweet job, I saw a sign saying they were closed from Feb14-Mar 2 so business must be good! If you're in Chicago, you need to check this place out but be prepared to wait in line for at least 45 min. And I think you have to be in line by around 3:30 to be guaranteed service. In any case, GO GO GO"
1132,"This place is a keeper!!! Doug himself is doing the greeting. Hot Doug's doesn't deliver the typical dog. Nope, far from it. You know you're on to something when the businesses slogan is ""The Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium"" or at the very least in for an interesting ride. It didn't fail to deliver. When you think of dogs, do you honestly think ""Portabella Mushroom and Swiss Cheese Pork Sausage with Blue Cheese Dijonnaise and Shiitake Mushrooms sauteed in Duck Fat"" come to mind? How about ""The Mountain Man Sausage (A damn tasty combination of Elk, Venison, Buffalo and Antelope) with Smokey Bacon Dressing and Vintage Van Gogh Cheese"" dog? I've had both and was worth the stop. To think no one thought to do this at the hot dog stand level. Amazing, rich & full of flavor. I've had these on other visits: ""Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel"" & ""The Atomic Ribeye: Damn Spicy Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions"" and both fantastic. I wish I had thought of this!!! For good measure, french fries cooked in DUCK FAT (off the charts good). Only small things are the waits can be long. Hot Doug's is cash only as well, so you won't need to have your plastic with you. It isn't often I get to this part of Chicago (at least as much as I would like). The hours would make a banker blush (Mon-Sat: 10:30AM-4:PM) but he, if it's still open, he's doing something right. Keep it up!!!"
1133,"The food is good but really didn't blow me away. I must say it's not worth the 1 hour 15 min wait. It's just hot dog, people! I had the Chicago dog and the bratwurst, and frankly I think they do a better job with the bratwurst than the classic Chicago hot dog. The toppings are standard stuff, not anything fancy. And the duck fat fries is purely a gimmick, can't tell the difference from good old oil fries at all. Prices are right and portion size is good. Would consider coming back if there was no line, but don't think that will happen any time soon. Simply overrated and a victim of food television that turned what used to be a good neighborhood place into a tourist trap."
1134,"I'm not sure a Yelp review can say too much more than the average line you'll probably see outside Hot Doug's, but this place is the quintessential stop for lovers of encased meats. Doug's menu is split into 2 sections: the first features a dozen fixed-menu items that range from elaborately constructed pork and chicken sausages to seafood dogs. The second includes a rotating cycle of specialty dogs which are anything but plain. The last time I went, I got a sun-dried tomato and pesto pork sausage topped with melted gouda; it was just as amazing as it sounds. Go on a weekday and before noon or after 3pm if you want to dodge the lines, but no matter the wait, your food will be worth it."
1135,"I waited on a hot Saturday last fall to eat at Hot Doug's. It was worth it. I had their mixed beef and pork dog Chicago style with everything, duck fat fries and a special - a curry sausage with coconut peanut sauce. Was it worth it? Yes. What was worth it? Not the duck fat fries. - They were good, but really overkill and I would have preferred regular fries, mostly they just made my heart work harder and the line longer outside. Not the standard dogs- This was pretty average and nt worth the trip or the line for me The special dog was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten, and the other specials looked equally amazing. I would go back here again and again and wait in that line for the special. The atmosphere - The employees , the primary colors of the space, and the fellow customers make it worth waiting. yay! hot dougs!"
1136,"Absolutely love Hot Dougs. Must eat if visiting Chicago, the line is long but worth the wait. Crazy variety of different meats in tube form. Mmmm"
1137,"Lived up to the hype and I'm coming back on my next visit for sure. I came looking for the best Chicago Hot Dog and I found it! If you like pate, try the Foie Gras. I wasn't as impressed by the other specialty hot dogs as I felt they had too much going on...next time will try the corn dog and definitely another Chicago style Hot Dog."
1138,"Seriously a great place to eat! Yes, you're going to wait in line 99% of the time, but it doesn't really matter once you get up to the counter. Doug is always pleasant, you you can tell he's genuinely thankful that you've come in. No matter how long the line he takes the time to say hello. As for the food. What more can be said that hasn't been in the hundreds of reviews? The place is amazing, and his creations are always unique and tasty. This is one place I'll just point to the specials because I know anything I get it going to be great."
1139,"A friend of mine was in town the other day and was determined to go here. So who am I to deny a friend some encased meat?! We got there early -- we were in line at 10:20 a.m. behind five othe people. Got in quick, got our food quick and enjoyed every minute of it. Just get the foie gras dog. I'm not going to describe it -- I'm sure others on here have already beaten me to the punch -- just get it. I didn't think I'd like it; I loved it. My friend gave it her four curse-word salute, which is basically like a critic giving a movie five stars. Go there. As soon as you can."
1140,"I would not normally spent $8 for a hotdog, but Doug knows how to make it so unique that I always come back for the exotic meats! Wild boar, alligator, snake, rabbit, etc... If you want something spicy, try the Atomic! My friends and I usually get a few special dogs and cut them up so we can get a taste of each. Great plan, huh? The person taking your order is always Doug. If he's sick, the restaurant goes on vacation until he gets better. How cool is that? My cousin once sent him a get well card when he's sick. LOL. The line wrapping around the building is worth the wait for sure. Yes, we've waited over an hour before. Through the rain, snow, hail, etc... However, I would only go on Friday or Saturday because of the DFF (duck fat fries). Also, don't forget to bring cash. Closes at 4pm so make sure you're in line by 3:59pm and you'll be okay. You cannot get in line after 4pm. I wanna go here for my birthday!"
1141,"I may have tainted my Hot Doug's experience slightly... After waiting 45 minutes in line for my first Hot Doug hot dog, I figured ""I better make this count."" So I ended up trying the Gator Dog and Foie Gras Dog to broaden my horizons, when I probably should have stuck with a classic, for a real comparison. Neither of the dogs were particularly outstanding, but were still worth the experience. If you're a newbie, I recommend fighting the urge to try the obscure dogs first."
1142,"Walking up and seeing a line of hungry people that goes out the front door and around the bulding to Me means this place must be really good! Well it is more then good, it is AMAZING and well worth the wait!!!! Doug the owner works the front counter and is very nice and knows his stuff. Being our very first visit we had to try a few things, so we got the Corndog, which is deep fried making is even yummier then anywhere else. Also, the Uber Pork Garlic Sausage which was out of this world delish! Also the Turducken Sausage, which again was out of this world delish!!! And finally, you have to try the fries with CHEESE please :) We will for sure be going back here, its NOT pretentious like some of the other spots around the city!"
1143,"AMAZING!!!! I am so, so, so glad to finally have had a chicago style hot dog done right, actually in Chicago! Heard from a local friend that this was the best, and I agree! I've had Portillos before and while they are good, it doesn't even compare to Doug's. The taste, ambiance, people, and general business way out-classes the other dog places I have been to... (except for Pinks). We waited an hour before ordering and it was worth it! The prices are so incredible, they could charge WAY more and still be this popular, guaranteed. Ill most likely never be back, but I am so glad to cross this off the bucket list! :D"
1144,"Went on a Monday at 11 am and still a line out the door!!! Had to wait about 20 min to get to the front of the line to place the order but our food came out fairly quick! We ordered a lot of food: 2 Chicago Dogs (steamed) with everything - 5 star Awesome...the Vienna beef with tomato, pickle, celery salt, peppers, onions, on a poppy seed bun. 1 Bratwurst (Charbroiled) with everything - 4 star Very juicy but the meat was a bit bland...but we didn't know it didn't come with sauerkraut so that was our bad so make sure to ask! 1 Selma Hyak *Hotlink* (Charbroiled) with everything - 2 star This was a total disappointment it was really burned...had to take off some of the charred pieces from the meat since some pieces were burned to a crisp and very dry. It wasn't spicy at all either =( 1 Marty Allen * Thuringer* (Charbroiled) with everything - 5 star Very tasty!!! Lots of garlic and spices and cooked to perfection! Make sure to taste this one! Overall a great experience! The owner was super nice ^^"
1145,"The most I'd ever spent on a hot dog was $3.50. The longest I'd ever waited in line for a hot dog was 5 minutes. That was till I visited Hot Doug's. I spent $23 on a hot dog lunch and waited in line for over an hour to get it. Lucky was I to have a fun group of Yelpers to entertained me while I waited. I could not have braved the line by myself. Having spent my entire lunch break standing in line, I grabbed my Foie Gras, my Game of the Day and my Salma Hayek (a hot dog, not the actress), and hightailed it back to the office. The plan was to wait until I got back to my desk to enjoy the dogs. Unfortunately, I just couldn't last that long. The aromas emanating from my meal were irresistible. I was taking huge bites of the foie gras while stopped at traffic lights. It was a really good hot dog but was overshadowed by my favorite: the Game of the Day. This red wine demi-glace venison dog, topped with fig goat's butter and raclette cheese, was truly delightful. The andouille sausage Salma Hayek, so called because like the actress it's hot and spicy, was also very tasty. So I bet you are wondering whether the price and the long wait at Hot Doug's were worth it. Absolutely! I would do it again in a heartbeat if I could have the same kind of company in line with me."
1146,"Went this past Saturday for the first time. Got in line at around 9:45am with 4 other friends and the line was already wrapped around the building. Was really curious to see what all the hype was all about. With five people, we had a chance to sample each other food. I personally ordered the Foie Gras and The Marty Allen. As a group we also had two orders of Duck Fat Fries. I honestly have no complaints about the food whatsoever. I savored every bite. I would say that the 45 minute wait was well worth it. Great food, Great service. This is a must try if you're in Chicago."
1147,"By the time you read this, I may be in prison for murdering my mother. Either involuntary manslaughter or premeditated murder - you be the judge. On a recent Friday, I took my 73-year-old hot dog/pizza loving Michigan residing mother to Hot Doug's. I took her here knowing full well that after her quad bypass a few yrs ago, the last thing her heart dr said to her was ""Remember, Jean, the two worst things a heart patient can eat are hot dogs and pizza."" So what did I do during her visit? I took her to Palermo's on 95th one night and Hot Doug's 18 hours later. We waited 80 mins in line down the block in 80 degree heat. She never complained - in fact, we bonded. And all the while my vegetarian friends were texting me, ""Don't do it! Leave now! Don't get the duck fat fries, either. You are killing your mother."" As I am neither Jewish nor Catholic, I do not possess one modicum of guilt. However, as we approached Doug to place our order, I did do one thing he has probably never seen a customer do. As I placed my order, I mouthed the words ""duck fat"" when ordering the fries, then I pointed at my mom and winked. He got it. My mom loved her Elvis sans her usual ketchup - a Polish sausage ""Smoked and savory - just like the King"". Thank god she didn't embarrass me by ordering ketchup on it - I had had THAT talk with her in line, about how it is virtually considered illegal to order ketchup on Chicago encased meat. (I think I read Mayor Daley is planning a tax on that soon, also.) I ordered the Laura Leighton - an Irish Banger with Goose Island Honker's Ale Mustard and Irish Harp Cheddar Cheese. Fantastic! I must say, though we scarfed down the duck fat fries in record time and will order again, I didn't think they were that much different than regular fries. No distinguishable taste difference to me but oddly enough the duck fat fries do seem less greasier. As of this writing, my mother is still alive and still reminding me that every time she comes for a visit, she wants to go back to Hot Doug's. I can't think of a better compliment."
1148,"In a town known for meat, Hot Doug's Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium rules the roost with a wide variety of encased meat goodness sourced from all over the world and a quirky hot dog museum atmosphere that any sausage lover cannot resist. Doug proudly displays his certificate from Hot Dog University and takes the orders himself. It's obvious that the man has a true passion for encased meats. The shop is in the middle of an industrial/non-retail business area. If you spot a long line, that's the line for Hot Doug's. It took me about half an hour to get to the front of the line and once the order was placed, the food arrived quickly. It's incredibly exciting to see the actual shop with pictures of hot dog advertisements, celebrities (some are signed), and hot dog paraphernalia - from vintage hot dog cookers, to plush hot dog dolls, hot dog gum, hot dog lights on a string, hot dog hand soap dispensers, and more. I own a hot dog pen/magnet and Doug had a couple of them (of course). Hot dogs are everywhere! Learn more about them by studying the History of Encased Meats poster. There are regular sausages that you can have grilled, steamed or deep fried, and a changing menu of specialty sausages, including a celebrity sausage, game of the week (ostrich during my visit but it could be rattlesnake, alligator, etc.). * The Atomic Bomb ($7.50): Damn Spicy Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Fontina Cheese. It's even better than it sounds. The pork sausage is quite spicy (I think I saw jalapeno bits) with amazing flavor, juicy and fatty in the best way. And it's bathed in this addictive spicy creamy chipotle dijonnaise, topped with a mountain of fontina cheese cubes (big ones) and surrounded by a soft, warm steamed bun. I thought the cold cheese was a strange idea but it actually works. Doug is a sausage genius. * Duck fat fries ($3.50): Only available on Fridays and Saturdays, a huge heaping portion of thinly, unevenly cut skin on fries, slightly crispy outside, soft inside. They grew cold very quickly and many pieces were tiny stubs. These were good but I'd rather have another sausage next time. After all, this place is all about the sausage. Cash only. Closest CTA stop: Belmont"
1149,"just as i imagined it to be AWESOME!!!!!! The Foie Gras topped dog is a must, never had Foie Gras and believe me this alone is well worth the wait; the foie gras jumps in your mouth and is so pronounced i can't explain in words you simply have to taste it. Also the fries are well done and nicely salted which works well with the hotdogs. The owner was very friendly and professional and really enjoys what he is doing. i simply love this place and will definitely go back for some more !!!!!"
1150,"Since Nathan W. went and outed me in his review, I might as well admit it. I lost my Hot Doug's virginity on Christmas Eve - with world famous b-list celebrity Patton Oswalt! Now it wasn't in the bathroom or anything - it was right at the table next to mine. And I can say he's much smaller in person. Seriously, now if it had been Michael Ian Black, I might really have humped his leg. But as it was, I just listened to his conversation while eating three delicious veggie dogs! Including, and this makes this place heaven for me, a VEGGIE CORN DOG (I accidentally ordered a regular corn dog first and Doug corrected me seeing as I had ordered two veggie dogs before, so that's awesome in my book)! Of course the goal of Hot Doug's seems to be to prove that you can put any sort of meat into a hot dog casing, but I will clearly state for the record that this is an awesome vegetarian restaurant as well. I had a Chicago Style (this also broke a cherry) veggie dog that made me cry a little in joy. The lines are long but the crazy 50s and 60s music (which doesn't really fit with the general decor but who cares) make them more bearable. Tables clear out pretty quickly so by the time our order came off the grill we were already seated next to every amateur food critic's favorite voice-over artist (he was Remy the Rat in ""Ratatouille"") and all was right in the world. For my next adventure in Avondale I hope to touch Kevin McDonald at Urban Belly. But that may be asking for simply too much. No, I'll probably just go back to Hot Doug's next time I'm star-struck and horny, er, hungry. I meant hungry."
1151,"Awesome variety of sausages that lives up to the hype. Duck Fat fries are closest thing you'll find to In N' Out fries in Chicago, but only on the weekends. Prepare to wait in line for at least 2 hours if you show up after they open on a weekend. Did the tourist thing when a buddy was in town to check out the hype and stood in line from 12-3. Between two people we spent $47 on about 6 or 7 sausages and two orders of duck fat fries. Overall, its a good place to order a bunch of different things and share. Tried the foie gras and it wasn't my thing, but hey, I tried it."
1152,"GOODBYE, YELP. Open letter to all on Yelp: Dear Friends, It has been a joy getting to know all of you and experiencing Chicago in a new way. Food has brought us together, but now we must part. For you see, I have eaten at Hot Doug's. I have had duck fat fries. I have tasted bacon sausage with wine infused grainy dijon mustard, herb garlic eurocreme and lettuce. I can die now. I can die in peace. MOURN NOT! Dry your eyes. I am going willfully, tranquilly. For there is no finer send off, my friends, than encased meats."
1153,"My friends have been members of the Hot Doug cult for years - they'll stand for hours in the cold, rain, snow, or heat to pay their respects to the encased meet god (Doug) and worship / eat his sausage offerings. I knew is was just a matter of time before I would convert and join the following. I had to write the obligatory Hot Doug's review, but I don't really know what else I can add that the 1,400+ reviews on here haven't described in detail. It's delicious and unique food, a great experience, a fun time, and one of those places you just have to try if you're in Chicago."
1154,"As we waited in line for 20 minutes, nervously wondering if bringing Dan's mom here was a mistake, a car drove by. The passenger leaned out the window and yelled ""hey morons, they're just hot dogs!"" Um, no sir they are not. Well, okay maybe if you just ordered a hot dog it really would be ""just a hot dog"" but with the amazing daily specials, why on earth would you do that? Mother in law went from skeptism (I'll just have a Coke) to hope (well, maybe we could split something) to belief (the ostrich sounds good) to devotion - she loved every bite and said she'd definately like to come back. We all tried bites from each other - the ostrich was amazing, the brandy fig duck with goat cheese was awesome, the blue cheese pork sausage was excellent and cheesey. My greek with skordalia and cheese (I asked for no olive tapanade) was the only thing less than amazing. It was still very good, but I learned that you don't mess with Doug's creations - order them as is. Service was great - Doug charmed my mother in law - the line moves quickly, and drink refills are free. Yeah it's not all that cheap is you are thinking that they are ""just hot dogs"" but $7 for some gourmet encased meats is a deal."
1155,"So check this out, this was our ultimate dawg order: - Tequila and Black Bean Chicken Sausage with Mango Salsa and Asadero Cheese ($7.50) - Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Pecorino Pepato Cheese ($8.00) - Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fired Onions ($8.00) - The Atomic Bomb: Damn Spicy Pork Sausage with Blood Orange Mustard and Habanero-Jack Cheese ($7.50) - Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris ($9.00) - Mandarin Orange and Teriyaki Chicken Sausage with Sriracha Mustard and Smoke Gouda Cheese ($7.50) - The Elvis: Good ol' Polish Sausage ($2.50) Are you salivating yet? This was the final stop on a whirlwind tour of Chicago eateries. What better way to end the dawg expedition by playing hide the sausage - and it took 2 and a half hours to do it. Whew, and am I tired. We arrived at Doug's at 1pm and at 3:30pm we met Doug who personally takes each and every order. This place is all about the exotic combination of sausage meats (I won't quote the motto because the other 800+ reviews of this place say it), but it's also about all the friends you make in line while waiting a frickin' hell of a long time. There were over 300 tourists and 2 locals crazy enough to wait over 2.5 hours for these links. One local, David S., was very helpful in explaining what to get and all the scenarios on what to expect and do inside. He summarized it pretty well: ""Doug's has the meats, Superdawg has the neon signs."" So here's the 9-step process: 1) Wait, wait, wait, kneel down, lay down, wait, wait... 2) Wait some more... (if you're near the dumpsters it's a 2 hour wait) 3) Have a hell of a hard time deciding what you want... 4) Talk with Doug. He calculates the total price and tells you... 5) Your jaw drops and hopefully you have enough cash... 6) You go sit down... 7) 4 minutes later they bring your dawgs... 8) Spend 20-30 minutes savoring all your choosings. 9) Spend another 10 minutes saying good-bye to everyone you met. What keeps people coming back is the weekly changing specialty encased meats menu. So all those sausages mentioned above could be completely different next week (except for th Elvis - he'll live forever with a Pocketful of Rainbows) We actually got lucky in that we went on Friday. Only on Fridays and Saturdays do they have ""Duck Fat Fries"" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) - What's that? You heard me... The perfect thinly cut potatoes deep fried in Duck Fat. They don't taste strange - they are just an awesome discovery of golden-brown crisp heaven. A large-size can easily satisfy 3 people and at $3.50 - what a deal! The goods with Duck Fat Fries: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) More goods: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) More goods: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) From the pics, the dawgs look of normal size, but it was hella-difficult to finish two of these per person. So even though a dawg is quite expensive, it does make for a rich filling meal. Waiting 2.5 hours is extremely excessive, but what an experience of aromas, textures and tastes. Hot Doug's is only open Monday through Saturday, 10:30am - 4:00pm. So due to the limited hours - you will be stuck in a line. It is as good as it gets in the dawg-eat-dawg world! And to think, I asked so many people in downtown C-town where Hot Doug's was and I got answers like: ""Who?, What? Never heard of it."" So almost passed on this place which would have been a tragedy in the making."
1156,"You're an idiot if you think 2+2 = 3, but you're even more of an idiot if you don't realize that going to Hot Doug's on a Saturday afternoon will require at least an hour long wait. My friends and I waited 2. Bring a deck of cards and your sudoku along with your cash, because you're going to need it. People will do ridiculous things for encased meats and duck fat fries. This was one of my last meals in Chicago was, and what a way to go. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. I love foie, truffle and sausage, so this was heaven. obesity heaven, but heaven nonetheless. I tried a friend's Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Montboissie Cheese...normally i don't like blues, and pungent blues at that, but with bacon and caramelized onions, it all went together perfectly. She enjoyed it thoroughly too. On a challenge, my other friend ordered the Mountain Man Sausage (A Damn Tasty Combination of Buffalo, Venison, Elk and Antelope) with Cassis Mayonnaise and Sartori Raspberry Cheese. She loved it and devoured hers first. I can proudly now say i've tried all those game meats. Thanks, Hot Doug's. And the boyfriend ordered up a regular dog and a Fire Dog (Keira Knightley). Boys are so low maintenance... I miss Chicago already. and Hot Doug's in particular. Not the line though. No one misses that line."
1157,It is finished! Two things taken out in one day - my 100th review and a trip to Hot Dougs! The lines are insane and there is no denying that but when can the anticipation be justified by the end result ... when you dig into those encased delights of Hot Dougs. I did see the online menu for their specials of the day and immediately decided between two dogs - the Jalapeno Pork Sausage and the Mandarin Orange Teriyaki Chicken Sausage. I went for the Teriyaki one and an order of the duck fat fries. I manged to score a small table and ate to my hearts content. Perhaps I didn't need to eat all of the fries but it is not that often that I will get a chance to have duck fat fries ... and yes they are very good. I waited in line with a couple who drove from South Bend that day just to give this place a try. They sat close to me and I'm pretty sure they were happy to have made the trip ... except for driving back with a food coma!
1158,"When I reviewed Hot Doug's last year, I noted that it had 350+ reviews. Now it has 750+ reviews. And I'm reviewing it again. Why? Because it's there. So I have now had the full-on HD experience, meaning 1) I came on a Friday, and 2) I waited in line. Oh, I've waited in line before, but 20-30 minutes on a weekday. Nothin'. And since we got to Doug's by 11 on Friday, the line was still only about an hour long. It wasn't even across the alley, down the block. Easy. I will say this: it was probably the nicest line I've ever waited in. Perhaps because it was an equal collection of locals and tourists -- I'm still not sure why that Australian in front of us was brandishing a deer hoof -- or perhaps because people know if they get unruly, Doug is not above sending them to their room. Here is my question about Hot Doug's: Where does everybody go? You wait and wait and wait in line, and hundreds of people go in before you, yet only a handful come out. And when you get to the front of the line, there's always seating inside. So where does everybody go? I'm thinking Sweeney Todd thoughts. Due to unfortunate circumstances, we had to take our purchases with us, rather than eating them there. And we had to make a stop on the way home. So the duck fat fries had turned into standard steamy, droopy fries. And the foie gras was not quite as tasty as it would have been hot. But the Thai chicken sausage with the peanut sauce was surprisingly good. And the jerk sausage was delectable. The venison with raspberry mustard was good, but last, and it's always hard to be last. So yes, wait in line, because it's worth it, and Doug is always friendly, and there will be somewhere to sit down. And the bathrooms are cool, even though some dickwad defaced the Duchamp."
1159,"There are many days when I curse the fact that I have to work second shift. Thanks to Hot Doug's I have a new found appreciation for it, since I could mosey over for a lunch time dog during the weekday instead of battling the tourist filled lines on the weekends. I went around 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and the line was quick, with lots of seats still available (parking too!) I convinced my lunch companion to go out on a limb and try their Jack Daniel's pork sausage with bacon mayo and cheese stuffed hot peppers instead of her go-to Chicago dog, which she was quite happy with. I figured I should take my own advice and try their duck sausage with foie gras. Foie gras was everything Anthony Bourdain promised it would be, downright amazing! The combination of hot, crispy duck sausage with fluffy foie gras...truffle aioli! FLEUR DE SEL?! I am now a foie gras fanatic, I want to put it on or in everything. It's become my newest obsession. (In other news, I'd love if someone made a savory foie gras toaster pastry. Yum) Lunch companion and I shared an order of fries and didn't even finish, since they were bland compared to our collection of encased meats. I'm willing to give the duck fat fries a chance, but I've heard there isn't much a difference. I think I'd rather just buy another experimental sausage to fill my tummy."
1160,"Okay over 500 reviews...I feel silly adding my two cents, but I will anyway. Yes...you will wait in line. Yes...the line moves fast. Yes...it is worth it! Yes...they only take cash. Yes...they have very short hours of operation. Yes...it's a tiny little place, with limited seating. Yes...it is tubular, encased meat heaven. Yes...this place is a little gold mine for Doug. No...I will never try just a ""Chicago Dog"" here (they have too many unique ones to try) No...I have never been disappointed eating here. No...I have never tried the duck-fat fries, because I have never been here on a Friday or Saturday...but I will...one day. No...I am not too scared to try the ""Foie Gras"" Dog....just getting the nerve up!"
1161,"Ha Ha!!!! Finally The AW has made it to Dougs The build-up: After having conversations with the following: Ralph C, Love S, Ryan L, Paige W and countless others, I started to feel like I was missing something by not making it here. On a Saturday evening, I decided to go at 5pm. I didn't check the time because I thought such a booming establishment would be open on a Sat evening. WRONG!!! I got there and I saw some kid in there mopping the floor and putting up chairs. DAMN! Yesterday afternoon, I went at noon and as I rode by I saw the chairs up on the table and no long line like I had been hearing about. He had a sign up saying he had been closed for a few days. WTF!!! TODAY: Took off of work today and decided this time I will call and to my surprise someone answered and it was Doug himself. He told me to get up there because he opens at 10:30 and the line will be out of the door. I jumped in my car and made it there in 10 mins. As I rolled up I saw a line just slightly out of the door. That was not gonna stop me! I got in line and got hungrier as I got closer to the front. I told Doug I was the guy on the phone and we had a good laugh about my failed attempts to sample his food. He recommended I get the day's special, The Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Sesame Seaweed and Sriracha Mustard. I got that along with the duck fat fries. If anyone has ever seen Harold & Kumar goes to White Castle, the moment when they finally got their sliders, that was me today. There was even another first timer there as well and he told me he drove all the way from Midway Airport to get there. That was a great meal and if I didn't mind standing in lines I would go more often. I have a rep for being impatient when it comes to waiting. The duck fat fries was nothing new to me. Growing up on the southside, we have always had those kind of fries, in different restaurants they just weren't called duck fat. Will definately be back, just don't know when."
1162,"Part of the joy of Hot Doug's is taking people here, and part of the unexpected challenges of Hot Doug's is taking people here who hate lines and have no reason to know why they're on one that might take an hour on a Saturday morning. I took my boyfriend here and good grief he was such a pill the whole time, like a grumpy four year old who had a hangover and kept insisting that it's ridiculous to wait this long for ""just a hot dog."" My testament to the deliciousness of Hot Doug's comes not from my love of exotic meats and their excellent cheese accompaniments, as well as quality ingredients and creative flavor combinations (and most of all my willingness to wait for them). It comes instead from the look on my grouchy impatient boyfriend's face when he scarfed down not one but two of their specials and half a basket of melt in your mouth duck fat fries. Then those three beautiful words, ""you were right!"" So I will reiterate that it's good to be skeptical of anything with a hype, anything with a wait, and anything that insists on inconveniences like cash only. Contemplate that the entire 30-40 minutes you're on line, and then open your mouth, insert anything on the menu, and then hug the person that dragged you there."
1163,"Hot dogs are only fast food when you can get them fast. When you have to wait 1-2 hours to get them, they cannot be called ""fast food."" Hot dogs are supposed to be fast food. That's the whole point of them. If you can't get them fast, why eat them? I appreciate a good sausage. Doug's are good, but they are not worth a 1- or 2-hour wait. Despite what 1,000 Yelpers say, they just aren't that good. Not even close. Good hot dogs, just not worth the wait. I think people feel like they have to swoon over these hot dogs to justify the fact that they stood in the sweltering heat or freezing cold for 2 hours to get them. If they weren't the best hot dogs in the universe, they would just feel silly for having spent 2 hours standing in line for them. Perhaps the judgement of some of these reviewers has been clouded by an excessive intake of rendered duck fat. Seriously, anyone can throw some fancy cheese and herb-infused this and chipotle that and such-and-such aioli on top of a sausage, and it's going to be good. But to wait 2 hours to buy it for $9? That is silly. The kitschy decor, hot dog art, and clever menu do add to the experience. Doug is obviously a good guy, and good for him that his place is successful. I don't want to take anything from him, just bring a little perspective, as Anton Ego would say."
1164,"Are you sure? Seriously? These are the best hot dogs ever? Oh sorry, I mean encased meats, not just hot dogs. Excuse me. But anyways, I don't get it. What's the big whoop? I'll probably either be crucified for daring to write this review when this place has hundreds of reviews comparing it to the Second Coming of hot dogs. I mean encased meats. Who doesn't love a good sausage fest? Waiting in line on a Wednesday afternoon was long - my party of 4 made it just long enough to be considered ""out the door."" Just barely. This made me think, ""damn, this better be worth the hype, or I'm kicking ass and taking names."" Okay, not really, but you get what I mean. I settled on a regular hot dog with everything but mustard and one of the speciality encased meats of the day - Parsley-Infused Weisswurst with Guinness Stout Mustard and Chive-Shallot Tintern Cheese . Oooo... I get a taste of snooty fancy dining wrapped in a white bread bun that reflects on middle class Americana that's more of my comfort zone. I also got fries and a fountain drink. I ordered a large, but Doug was actually nice enough to tell me to go for the small with unlimited refills. Nice watching out for my wallet, Doug! But I have a feeling that the fountain drink was my Judas. I never drink pop these days, but I downed two cups of Cherry Coke before my meal even came because I grew up loving this stuff, and face it, I have poor impulse control. Which made everything I tasted to be okay or meh. Not fantastically wonderful that everyone proclaims this place up to be. Good, but not worth waiting for hours for a taste of this. I felt bad with my friends watching me excitedly to be overcome with waves of orgasmic pleasure that one is supposedly to feel when the good Lord touches them. It was okay. But it could have been the devil's bastard child, HFCS in that Cherry Coke, numbing my tongue to the pleasures of encased meats. So, sorry, I don't see the big deal about this place being the Second Coming, but go ahead and bind me to the cross - what good is a resurrection without a crucifixion? And, hey, we're about 2,000 years overdue."
1165,"When you're but a novice, you get the caviar duck liver bacon brat or the Thai African elk dog with Pop Rocks, or whatever is like $7, and you will fucking love it. And you get a corn dog on the side. When you're settling in and really getting to know Doug's still, you get a simple char dog or a polish. And you get a corn dog on the side. When you know better and you are wise from experience, you just get two corn dogs. The corn dogs are like....like if a cake doughnut felated the best hot dog ever, maybe? Kind of like that. But the one thing everyone knows - everyone knows - you get the fries. Stupid long lines. Weird-ass hours. Cheap delights. But still cash only - boo that!"
1166,"The Food Gods have blessed this journey to the only city in the world named after a food, and have steered us to the encased meat emporium known as Hot Doug's. We had to come here on a Friday because we HAD to have the duck fries (offered only Fridays and Saturdays) and we got there early because we heard the line starts forming right away. We sat in our car before the doors opened at 10:30 am, and couldn't help but notice all the other people sitting in their cars as well - could they also be waiting for the doors to open? Yes, they were, because at 10:25, car doors started opening and people started queuing. Here's why: It's not just the ketchup red and mustard yellow decor, and it's not the fact that Hot Doug himself (he looks like the Verizon guy's brother) is manning the counter with a steady patter, it is the fact that Doug has raised the hot dog into a culinary art form that includes kangaroo sausages and one made of a mixture of elk, venison, antelope and buffalo. That's what I had: The Mountain Man! It tasted better than elk, venison, antelope and buffalo ought to taste in encased meat form, it was transcendant! Complex, smoky, not gamey at all. My friend Jeanne got the Jack Daniels Fennel Pork Sausage (I had a bite - tast-ee!), and my pal Marc got the Foie Gras Sauterne Duck Sausage and a regular Hot Doug, just so we could taste the snap of their regular dogs. Some people have issues with foie gras, and I didn't know where I stood on that debate until I had a taste of Marc's Foie Gras Duck Sausage. I am now pro foie gras. And the duck fat fries? Phat! Crispy! Thinly sliced! Colors ranging from golden to caramel brown, skins still on them, and again...transcendent. Someone told us that Chicago does regular food raised to an art form better than any other city in the world, and this is a shining example."
1167,"This was my first review in May of 2007. Oh my, now i have Michael Jackson's ""Remember the Time"" in my head. I've been going here since 2003 and alot has changed. Since then -- * His original Roscoe and Western location caught fire and he was closed for 9 months while looking for another place. He had a little clock teaser on his website counting down to when he would reopen. The longest 9 months of my life. * His dogs have gone through many name changes. Britney Spears is now Jennifer Garner. Ann Margaret became Madonna which became Salma Hayek (i think). Please let me know if i'm wrong. * I came straight here with my parents after i had a colonoscopy...that morning. * There are now a billion more reviews for this place. * I got a missed connection here a couple years ago when i went with my sister! It was very cute. I love the andouille. After surfing through most of the menu, i've settled on this (well, along with a large fries and a corndog). Doug always asks how i'm doing regarding my health which is nice of him. I've become well-versed in when to show up and have never waited more than 30 min. 15 min on average. I can't quit you!"
1168,"My mom and I were driving by here on a Saturday morning about 10:30. I guess she's never driven by here to witness the throngs of Hot Doug's disciples that line the street waiting for their encased meat fix. My mom, who's naturally funny, asked what everyone was standing in line for: ""Is it a soup kitchen line for hipsters?"" I almost crashed my car from laughing so hard."
1169,"Time spent in line: 1 hour. 5 minutes Time before I ordered when I got a call back from Katie H, Dan H and Lauren H saying yes, they would love for me to order them Hot Doug's and bring them 5 minutes 4 specials sausages, 1 veggie and 2 orders of duck fat fries $37 Having Hot Doug's for lunch with some good friends and try: Priceless For all your meaty needs, (and veggie dog needs) there is only one Hot Doug's."
1170,"Hot damn, I mean Doug's, was that line long! I stopped by Doug's on July 3rd hoping that the number of people who had to work plus the number of people going out of town for the holiday would mean that the line would be shorter. Who was I kidding?!?! The line was just as long as usual, maybe longer since the following day (7/4) Doug was closing up shop for a week-long vacation. As someone who abstains from 99% on encased meats I silently began to question the sanity of my plan; especially when one hour became close to two! Initially, I silently ridiculed those people that brought food with them for the wait in line, but after an hour I was jealous of their ingenuity. For those who came without pre-Doug's sustenance there was an ice cream man parked out front ringing his bells and playing his ice cream man music enticing people to buy a cold treat. (I was unwilling to compromise any space in my stomach for ice cream.) If I wasn't so hungry I would've jumped for joy upon reaching the front of the line. Instead, I just placed my order for 2 veggie dogs Chicago style and a large fry with cheese on the side. So was the food worth the wait? You betcha!! The ensuing food coma was worth every tasty, gluttonous bite! Sure a carnivore has more menu choices here, but I'd brave the wait in a second for more Doug's. TIP: If you think you can roll up at 4 and still get some Doug's think again my friend, they cut the line off prior to 4 so that the last person reaches the counter around then. TIP: Wear some comfy shoes, bring something to read, bring some water and a snack or two for your wait in line."
1171,"After an unexpected moving truck breakdown, I found myself deserted by my friends while waiting in a lengthy queue to try the famous homemade sausages at Hot Doug's. While I generally find the idea of standing in any type of line revolting, I was lucky enough to find myself in the company of three friendly strangers who were equally obsessed with national food travel. We explored various culinary options across the United States while offering our personal experiences in cities such as Las Vegas, Seattle, Austin, New York, and New Orleans. Coupled with parking disasters and people whining about the queue, their company dramatically sped up the process. On a number of occasions, I had to check my cell phone to determine whether SG's movers had arrived. One of the strangers noted, ""If you check that cell phone while you are at the counter, I think you should have to go back to the end of the line. I countered, ""If I check my cell phone when I get to the front of the line, I shouldn't be allowed back in the line."" Smiles abounded. It's easy to make friends. I was next in line. Time to play a practical joke. ""Hello? Hey SG!!!!"" I looked back at the strangers and smiled. No, I'm not that asshole. Hot Doug's is not the type of place where you dally around with your order. I was ready. My order consisted of the following: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris ($9.00), White Wine Rabbit Sausage with Sauce Moustards, Goat Cheese, and Spicy Calabrese Peppers ($6.50), Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Smokey Blue Cheese ($8.50), Chicago Grilled Hot Dog with Relish, Dill Pickle, Onions, Mustard, and Ketchup ($1.75), Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds ($8.00), and Duck Fat Frites ($3.25). On my way back to SG's place, I started snacking on the duck fries. While the fries were tasty, I was hoping for each bite to be oozing in duck fat. That simply was not the case. While nearly everyone on Yelp glorifies these fries, I would pass on them for the regular cheese fries on a subsequent visit. We started with the duck sausage. It should be mentioned from the outset that even without the condiments, the different sausages used at Hot Doug's are extraordinarily flavorful. The use of the natural sea salt and the allegedly banned in Chicago foie gras was a nice touch, but the truffle aioli is what carried this particular hot dog. It meshed perfectly with the gamey flavors of the duck. Even more outstanding was the expertly spiced rabbit sausage. The spicy mustards and pepper were properly doused with the pairing of the goat cheese. The result was an excellent meledy for the wine-doused rabbit. Both the duck sausage and the rabbit sausage were superb, but it is the rabbit sausage that will keep me talking about Hot Doug's for decades. Who knew a hot dog could be so decadent? I should have avoided the crawfish on principle alone. First, it was called crayfish. What is the hell is that? Crawdads, yes. Crawfish, yes. Crayfish? Hell no. Second, and more important than a simple nomenclature issue, crawfish is out of season. So this one had that going against it as well. While this particular pork sausage had the nice flavors of an Andouille from New Orleans, the flavor combination of a poorly made remoulade with out-of-season crawfish made for a slightly underwhelming experience. Hot Doug's thoroughly redeemed itself, however, with the Chicago Dog. We ordered ours grilled with all the toppings. I suggest you do the same. The dill pickle gives a satisfying textural crunch and slightly sour taste to complement the Dog. At less than $2 per hot dog, these are an absolute steal. While I was quite full by the time I reached the Blue Cheese flavored pork sausage covered in creme fraiche and almonds, it was still delightful. The use of almond with pork sausage was a new concept. I liked the marriage of traditional English flavors with cuisine from the Heart of Dixie all in the heartland of America. It was enough to make Churchill swoon. If you are in the Chicago area, I would strongly suggest that you brave the line and try at least two flavored dogs and perhaps two of the regular ones. If you are local, it would be a nice place to take a group of six and just sample a ton of nicely flavored meats. Then head over to Kuma's Corner and finish yourself off with a nice burger. Then diet for the rest of the month. Then repeat. I love Hot Doug's. Looking forward to another visit in the near future."
1172,"REASON 1: Foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and sel gris. REASON 2: Fresh cut potatoes rendered in duck fat. Shortest review I'll ever write, because if those two things above don't give you enough of a reason to wait in line for an hour or two, then I really can't help you. Seriously. Duck sausage hot dog topped with foie gras + duck fat fries. Your gall bladder will hate you, but your taste buds will call you God. Amen."
1173,"I did it. I finally met SF sweetheart Liz S., and I had Hot Doug's...on the same day, no less. Liz, daughter and I waited in line about 25 minutes. Once we placed our order, it was less than 5 before the food came. They say standing is better than sitting. They do say that. But the cool thing is you can easily sit and relax. For the wait, they've got a great meal and awesome logistics. -Liz - foie gras dog with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris -Me - cherry and apple pork sausage with sweet curry mustard, goat cheese, and rum-soaked dried berries -Riotous Girl - plainest of dogs, with ketchup. I didn't harass. It really is nothing like I've ever tasted. You should spend time appreciating each little morsel on its own before going in for the perfect bite. The goat cheese and dried cherries were a gorgeous combo. It's the first time sausage was like fine dining. Or whatever. You can chow to your heart's content or two or three if that's how you like it."
1174,"Well, we all know they have the best dogs in town. The veggie dog we had here was by far the best veggie hot dog I've ever tasted. However, they get 4 stars for their inefficient ""waiting"" system -- they seriously need to implement a Portillo's style drive-thru deal because freezing your ass off in the snow is no fun at all. P.S. BRING CASH!"
1175,"With over 200 reviews and climbing there is not one thing that hasn't been said (and in great detail no less) about Hot Doug's. At this point, the only thing your review serves as is your self-serving badge of honor proclaiming that you too are now an esteemed member of the Encased Meats Club. Hot Doug's has a crazy following and this type of yelp hype certainly isn't slowing him down anytime soon. He could move the shop to Peoria and we'd still be clamoring wind, sleet and rain to stand in line for that greasy goodness. And if anything else, just go to say you went, as apparently we all do... the badge is actually pretty groovy."
1176,"1pm Thursday, 7 minute wait. -Apple Pork Sausage w/mustard curry and melted gouda -the Dog (Chicago Dog) I just have good Hot Doug's Karma with low wait times. I really would like to see the standard Doug menu posted at least in the breezeway or outside so one can drool and peruse while waiting in line! I get heart palpitations trying to decide quickly between the Star of the Day (today was a Chipotle and Cilantro chicken sausage w/Mole) and all of the other Greatest Doug Hits!"
1177,Yes! Another great visit. This time I had the... Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage w/ Cajun Remoulade and Swiss Cheesehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HOJqzz1WvOmeR9oESJ4d9A?select=GZ3ZTs0nIRKRvReAmyoeCg Wild Boar Sausage w/ Chili Garlic Mustard and Vodka Currant Cheese http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage w/ Sriracha Mustard and Sesame Seaweed Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Rosemary Smoked Chicken Sausage w/ Rosemary Garlic Mustard and Caruchon Cheese http://www.yelp.com/biz_ The best sausage I have had here would have to be the Smoked Shrimp and Pork. It was mind blowing.
1178,"We've been doing these Chicago eating binges with our friend Maria, which allows us to do a lot more sampling than if it was just me and my wife. This is why we can order four different sausages at Hot Doug's without feeling too guilty. Chicago-style hot dogs differ from other styles of hot dogs because they generally include mustard, onions, an artificially colored neon-green relish, tomato slices, and a pickle spear, all served on a poppy seed bun. I made sure that all of our orders had everything on it, although this may have been a tactical mistake on the bratwurst, which I would have like to have tried with just sauerkraut. The bratwurst was still excellent since it was very juicy, probably because it's soaked in beer. We also had The Elvis, a smoked polish sausage, and The Dog, a traditional Chicago-style hot dog. But the best hot dog of the day was the spicy hot dog known as The Keira Knightly. What I liked about the Keira was that the spicy dog had a nice heat that balanced out the other flavors that were packed into the dog, especially the sweet relish. The other dogs were good, but Keira's relative hotness separated it from the pack. The menu described the Keira Knightly as ""mighty hot,"" but I thought it was a pleasant, mild heat. By comparison, the andouille sausage known as the Salma Hayak (which we didn't order) is said to be ""mighty, mighty, mighty hot."" If this is true, then Salma is hotter than Keira in both hot dogs and real life. Still, as good as the hot dogs were, they were nearly eclipsed by an even more impressive concoction...duck fat fries. That's right...french fries fried in duck fat. I shouldn't have to say anything more except that duck fat fries are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, so plan your trip accordingly. There's a quote on the wall at Hot Doug's by someone named Secret Robbie that says: ""There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats,' my friend."" Word."
1179,"CASH ONLY. This would have been good for me to know, as I had about 11 cents in my wallet and had planned on using a debit card. I waited in line for 20 minutes (!!) before I even saw the sign that says ""cash only."" My heart and tummy dropped to the floor! Oh no...another attempt at eating at this godforsaken place I can never seem to get off my list...Dooomed! Luckily, I had the good fortune of meeting 2 couples, vacationing in Chicago. They were a bit older, but spry and witty...my favorite kind of people. Tom R.: Oh no! What are you going to do?? (as I frantically look around for an ATM) Colleen: SIGHHHHHHH. I don't know. (FROWN, pout) Tom R: Well, I have some cash... Colleen: Oh no no no, I couldn't. Tom R.: Well, you could exchange me for a check, right? Colleen: (brightens) You are from out of town, aren't you!??? City dwellers would never even offer that option! Tom R: Yes. Out of towners, but I figure $10...not gonna break the bank. Even if your check is bad! Colleen: (getting out check book) It will clear, I promise! You've saved my hot dog mission! Tom R: Laughs, (gives me 2 fives and a second chance on Hot Doug's Life) SO anyway, I just stuck to the basics after my 30 minutes in line. Chicago Dog and french fries. LARGE diet coke. MMMMMM. Nothing like hitting the spot for $4.50 and 45 minutes total waiting...devoured in 2. :)"
1180,"What can I say besides Doug is the man! He has got a good thing going here and he knows it and he doesn't exploit (or hasn't yet) his idea into branching out and expanding! When I see a line wrapped around a building for food 99 out of 100 times I keep on going and hit up someplace else. I waited the 45-60 minutes today. I hear that the wait is always like this on Saturday's. As i was standing in line, I kept saying to myself, ""I can't believe I am waiting this long for hot dogs. Yes I waited... Yes I was very happy that I did wait. All I ordered was two hot dogs and a fountain soda. With all of the other dog/sausage options I wanted my inaugural visit to consist of the core foundation that Hot Doug's was built on: Simple Chicago Style Hot Dogs. I took the grilled over the steamed hot dogs and there is nothing like a char-grilled hot dog. The fries were also hand cut and very tasty! What really impressed me was the efficiency in which they ran the place. Doug is the conductor of this symphony at the register and he has a clear view of the entire operation and controls the speed of the line so there is not a wait for a table at all even though there is a line around the block. I am already looking forward to my next lunch outing here"
1181,"So good but the lines suck. Avoid it like the plague in the summer as it turns into a ""I saw this shit on Food Network,"" tourist trap. Get the duck fat fries on Friday and Saturday and definitely get the duck and sauternes sausage with fois gras, sel gris and black truffle dijon. Doug please make your establishment larger. Stop torturing your regulars in the winter you sadist bastard! (I kid but seriously... do something about the fucking lines.)"
1182,"This is the ULTIMATE sausage shop. Greatest sausage I've ever had. seriously. If this shop were sponsored by Squaresoft or Origin, it would be called ULTIMA SAUSAGE. Apparently Doug went to Kendall Culinary School in Chicago, but then decided that ENCASED MEATS were his life calling, and he opened up this temple to delicious sausages of all sorts (made by himself of course). So hear's the lowdown. There's pretty much always a line. Deal with it. expect it. It probably takes about 30-40 minutes to get through on a typical day. While in line you survey the vast selection of gourmet sausages, and classics like the classic chicago dog, andouille, louisiana hotlinks, etc. They have DUCK FAT FRIES on Fri and Sat. Yes you heard me. Best. fries. evah. When you get to the counter, you order directly from Hot Doug himself. Doug is very friendly and cracks some hilarious jokes. No condescension. He just shares with you a mutual love of the encased meats. You can customize your condiments as much as you like. He also gives you the option for preparing the sausages: grilled or steamed. A few of the sausages I had (I'll post a pic of the menu from the wall as well): -Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage, with black truffle mustard, foie gras mousse, and some course salt sprinkled on top. As I was eating this, my life flashed before my eyes, and I wanted to tell my parents I loved them. and then it was done. and I wanted another. -the classic Chicago dog. The classic chicago dog (for the uninitiated) is a boiled/steamed Vienna Beef hot dog with sliced tomatoes, relish, onions, a long dill pickle, and celery salt. Doug's has grilled onions instead of the raw onions, and he recommended I get it grilled instead. he was right of course. -the spicy smoked alligator sausage, with shrimp remoulade and a peppery brie-like cheese (affinois? thanks michael l!). Spicy and exotic, it was just exciting to eat a formerly endangered species....haha. but seriously, everything came together beautifully on this sausage. -citrus burgundy pork sausage, with course dijon mustard and smoked gouda chunks. people that know me know that I love pork. I'm chinese. This sausage made me want to propose marriage to pork. you know. like the scene in harold and kumar. -the Ribeye sausage, with horseradish cream sauce and fried onion strings. This was (as the name) a very ""pure"" sausage. just encased ribeye--the grind was rather course as well. a complete departure from your standard spiced sausages. -smoked duck with chili-garlic aiolli, blue cheese, and drizzled with honey. I didn't think I'd ever get better duck sausages than the rosamunde grill in SF. Doug proved me wrong, happily. I took pics of all of these, and posted them here.... so check em out. oh and don't forget to get your DUCK FAT FRIES I can't recommend this place any more. seriously. the only thing that could make it better would be a large selection of finely crafted beer. :)"
1183,"This is a long one, but Doug deserves it... It's the weekend, and resisting the urge to sleep-in is an arduous task. Recounting last night's festivities makes slumber's temptation even more of a welcome embrace, and I can't even begin to formulate a To Do list. Incentives work--like Saturday morning cartoons, or a fear of God, or the stumbling, awkward ""Who are you again?"" to that groggy eyed stranger who tried to take my kidneys last night. But none are relevant at this point in my life. I know for certain that I can rise like the morning wood for one thing: the promise of a Hot Doug's trip to savor multiple encased meat delicacies. Going before noon on a Saturday ensures that the line is only out the door, not down the block--a true testament of Doug's popularity. The General Gist... Folks--especially out of towners--laugh in my face when I suggest this atypical hot dog stand in Avondale. How does it differ? Well, owner Doug Sohn is a Kendall College culinary school alum. The man is a trained chef, bringing his discerning tastes to round out perfect sausages. Doug doesn't stop there, adding a specials menu loaded with creative touches. From rare game meats to gourmet toppings, one can savor a smoked rattlesnake sausage covered in blueberry-port sauce and then smothered in smoked gouda cheese. So, when my dubious visitors see the menu, their jaws drop. Then, I get to box their ears and shame them into promises I know they can't keep. The transparency of a fool acting smart is an easy call, but everyone loves it when the intelligent play with idiocy. The atmosphere is bright and colorful, as if painted by a clown--a happy entertainer, not one of those sad, alcoholic ones. It's covered by all sorts of wiener related humor, sometimes divulging into phallic jokes. Doug works the counter and takes your order, cracking jokes with endless line of customers with an equally endless wit. That, and with all the kids around, he's still plays Fear and the Dead Kennedys over the P.A. It's $1.50 for a regular dog. The specials (changed on Fridays) run about $6-$8. Order a large soda and you're eating in, Doug will probably recommend the small soda with free refills. The Personal Touches... Hot Doug's initially drew me when catering a party I attended, and he talked about his quest to find the perfect veggie dog. A vegetarian at the time, I respected a solid veggie dog and was further impressed that it was called the Howard Devoto--an obscure nod to The Buzzcocks' first singer. With repeat visits, I realized what I was missing by eschewing meat. Then, one Saturday afternoon, in line, I broke down and threw ten years of vegetarianism out the window. Occasionally I'll call in sick to assuage a Hot Doug's craving. Once, while ordering the Celebrity Sausage, that week's celebrity was eating in the restaurant. He took my photo and it appeared on the Chicago foodie messageboard The Lth Forum. Busted. Even Heaven has its Drawbacks... Everyone gripes about the hours. Monday through Saturday, 11am-4pm. And Doug takes long--but much-deserved--vacations. He'll warn the public on his website, so it's wise to check before heading out. Often I've made the mistake of showing up to a darkened storefront, but nothing was more crushing than showing up at the old location to see the upstairs neighbor moving out and the ceiling completely charred from the infamous fire. Speaking of which, I do miss the old space near Roscoe and Western. Only because I could walk around Roscoe Village's charming commercial strip afterwards to walk off the meal. The Midway Games headquarters is across the street from the new location, but I doubt one could just walk in and start playing Pac-Man. For vegetarians, understand that this is a hot dog stand. Doug cooks the veggie (but not vegan) dogs on the same grills as the rest of the sausages. That, and his renegade disregard for Chicago's foie gras ban landed his photo in the New York Times. I'm sure PETA has a warrant out for him and he'll have red paint thrown on him by an activist in a giant bunny costume. So, today is Friday and I'm slacking off work just to write this tome... I've got plans Saturday morning that doesn't involve American Gladiators. Do you?"
1184,"While I'm waiting in line to order my bacon sausage with avocado mayo, roma tomatoes and lettuce, the kid in front of me is standing in front of Doug, talking on his cell phone and holding up the line. ""Say hi for me,"" shouts Doug. The kid ignores him. So Doug shouts into the phone, ""Tell Michael he needs to start wearing pants when he leaves the house!"" The kid bought a cookie and sat down. Bravo, Doug. Bravo. You're the coolest restaurant owner I've ever met. Oh, and my sausage was mind-blowingly delicious. I normally wouldn't dream of paying $7 for a weiner, but I would gladly pay $10 for the BLT. I keep trying to induce burps so I can experience the flavor again. UPDATE 12/7/07: Waited a half hour in the snow to get inside. Had the ribeye steak sausage with garlic-horseradish sauce. It was amazing. Duck fat fries were outstanding. On Tuesday, I had a regular bratwurst. It also was kickass. Some people wait a half hour, then got to the counter with no cash. Doug's only takes cash. I felt bad for them."
1185,"I finally made the trek to the meat mecca with two of my favorite Yelpers. Yes, I stood in line. Yes, it was crowded. And? It was worth every minute on the bus and in line! I had one of the daily specials: Spicy Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango Dijonnaise, Roasted Plantains and Crescenza Cheese. With cheese fries, of course. Oh my. Doug rules. He even save me a few pennies by reminding that there are free refills on the soda. Smaller size, it is, Doug. Thanks. My heart finally stopped racing. I'm ready to go back."
1186,"I am not going to go into detail about each and every dawg I tried because my review would be about 20 paragraphs long. Seriously. Am I ashamed of myself for such gluttony? A little. Was it worth it? Hell, yes. I joined a bunch of fellow hookie playing yelpers for encased meat mayhem at Hot Doug's one Friday afternoon. My cohort and I arrived just before 11AM. A pretty good line had already formed. Luckily, we spotted the rest of the lunch posse in line already and joined them. Some might say we cut in line but I say it was all just part of the planning process! We stood in line a good hour chatting it up in the sunshine while carefully reviewing the menu that was printed in advance. That's right, the menu was printed in advance, people! That's how we roll, yo. We were a fairly large group so we ordered two dogs each for sharing. I highly recommend going this route. There are SO many delicious dogs on the menu to choose from. Ordering 10 dogs meant I got to try pretty much every specialty dog being featured that week. Genius! Duck fat & regular fries rounded out the table order. The duck fat fries were all I thought they would be. Effing fantastic. Oh, and they have orange soda on fountain! Bonus! I also have to mention that I had a corn dog. The best corn dog I've ever had. Period. I'm pretty sure it put me over the edge and sent me into a hot dog coma but again, it was worth it. My top three: 1) Game of the Week which was venison sausage w/a fig goat's butter and raclette cheese. The butter is what really made this dog. 2) Foie Gras and sauternes duck sausage w/truffle aioli and foie gras mousse. I'm not a big foie person, but this dog was fantastic. It's pretty rich and a good one to share. 3) Cognac infused lamb sausage w/spinach raita and manchego....as good as it sounds. Do not let the line intimidate you. It's totally worth it. Doug's is the real deal and something that everyone should experience. It makes me happy just thinking about it..."
1187,"Having heard that Doug's frequently generates a 1-2 hour line shortly after opening we decided to check out the hot dog scene first - arriving at 11:00am (only 30 minutes after opening) this proved to be a good call as the line was already 30 persons deep (a far cry from the 60+ waiting when we left.) Waiting in line all we heard was locals discussing how it was ""totally worth it"" and raving about previous experiences with Doug's specialty encased meats and (Friday and Saturday only) Duck Fat Fries. Chatting with the friendly crowd our 45 minute wait brushed by and we soon found ourselves standing in front of the big board of common and not-so-common choices. Kitschy dcor aplenty and Doug himself managing the register we approached and placed our orders - each of which was ""approved"" by Doug who, despite the lines, was personable and pleasant telling us about some of his button collection and making suggestions on whether each choice should be fried or broiled - heck, he didn't even laugh at my mother's request for a ""plain hotdog"" - but I certainly did. Taking our seats and listening to the radio we filled our sodas and waited about 10 minutes before our orders arrived. Starting first with my aunt's and mother's boring orders - namely a plain hotdog and duck fat fries for my mother and an Elvis (Polish Sausage with tomato and onion) for my aunt. Additionally ordered by my aunt as a more adventurous option was the Teuben of Corned Beef Sausage with Russian Dressing, Saurkraut, Swiss Cheese. As I do not consume beef I did not taste any of these options but all three were noted to be ""awesome"" by the ladies and the duck fat fries were quite good with their crispy exterior giving way to a soft and fluffy center - while not as good as Michael Mina's signature fries I think this was likely more due to the lack of designer ketchups than the actual fries. The next duo of dogs, ordered by my sister - an absolute hater of hotdogs in general and a naysayer walking into the experience - was the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut and the Saucisson Alsacienne of Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions, Double Cream Brie. First digging into the Thai option both my sister and myself were very impressed by the subtle nuances encased in the meat - namely a great degree of heat that was tempered well by the creaminess of the peanut butter and coconut fats. While not exactly ""authentic Thai"" or an ""authentic hotdog,"" I liked the encased meat more than either. The second selection, entitled a bacon sausage was decidedly more fatty than the chicken sausage and reminded me more of jowl bacon or porkbelly than a true piece of bacon. Akin to Chang's pork buns at Momofuku in texture the fatty pork's saltiness paired well with the sour crme fraiche while the savory and pungent onions proved an excellent foil to the sweet and hearty helping of brie. While my sister wasn't particularly thrilled with the texture of this option, I found it to be quite excellent and gladly helped her out with finishing the dog. For my options, two dogs were selected - namely the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse, Sel Gris and the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Goat Cheese. Beginning with the Shrimp/Pork option I was instantly struck by the impressive manner in which the pig and the shrimp worked together - smoky and well blended in texture the dish was further enhanced by the remoulade and hefty helping of goat cheese which created an almost gumbo flavor with a bit of heat and a whole lot of savory saltiness. The final item - the piece de resistance for myself - was indeed the Foie Dog; not since The Bazaar's Foie Cotton Candy with Corn Nuts had I seen a more obscure way to use the most decadent of all foods. Presented as a sizable piece of terrine atop a sublime duck sausage with the classical flavors of sauternes built right in the dish was put even further over the top by the addition of crunchy grey salt and a creamy and aromatic truffle cream aioli. At $9 the sausage certainly wasn't cheap, but it was oh-so-worth it. With tax, tip, and drinks the family ended up walking out of Doug's full, happy, and smiling for less than $15 a person - something I don't think we ever expected from ""a hotdog joint."" Kitschy dcor (check out the bathrooms,) an incredible down-to-earth owner, and top notch food. Having waited in lines for other ""hype"" restaurants in many other cities I can definitely say Hot Doug's lives up to the substantial hype. Perhaps the two best words in the English language are indeed ""Encased meats"" - provided those meats are of the quality of Doug's!"
1188,"Damn you Hot Doug's... my taste buds love you but my arteries hate you. Why must you tempt me with your amazing traditional and constantly everchanging selections of eclectic encased meats (which can be ordered not just grilled or fried but grilled AND fried)? I know the true secret of your hot doggy powers... your special seasoning... it's really crack isn't it? Yeah, I thought so. How else could anyone in the right and proper mindset put up with waiting in a line that runs out the door and around the corner on a perfectly good Saturday afternoon just to get a taste... oh dear god please, just one more bite. I got to sample your ribeye sausage with pesto dressing, gator sausage with feta, and corn dog... but damnit all! I forgot to get your duck fat fries (only on Friday/Saturday) and foolishly ordered a LARGE order of the regular goods. I reluctantly scarfed down every morsel in 60s flat... but that didn't mean I liked it!... Who am I kidding, I LOVED it... I'll be back, OH YES... I'LL BE BACK... AND I'LL GET YOUR DUCK FAT FRIES TOO... MY PRETTY!"
1189,"On our last day in Chicago, my boyfriend and I decided to go out of way to get to Hot Doug's before catching our flight. We were psyched to have the duck fat fries, as well as anything else we could get our hands on. We made the trek here, drooling the whole way over and discussing which wonderful encased meats we would try. We waited on the line outside for about 35 minutes, sure it'd be worth it. Finally reached the counter and the warmth inside, only to see the one sign that would crush all of our hopes and dreams... CASH ONLY. How did we not know this beforehand? I studied their website and read a few yelp reviews and thought we were ready for greatness. Turned out, we were only ready for $7.00 worth because that's all we had between the two of us. JUST enough for the duck fat fries and one Chicago dog each. Not even a drink to wash it down. Saddest moment of my life, so why the 5 stars? This place is kick-ass, regardless of our stupidity! Plus, it just means we'll have to plan another trip to Chicago now! Next time, we'll be prepared. We even found an ATM nearby (after the fact, of course, and by accident) on the way to O'Hare... just in case."
1190,"Oh, for the love of encased meats! Hot Doug's lives up to the hype and more. At the risk of sounding like a Yelp/Food Channel/Bourdain victim, I made Hot Doug's a dining destination on my trip to Chicago. Luckily, the delightful Ellen M. was willing to meet me and accompany me on this pilgrimage. Good thing, because there is a huge line. HUGE line. Like down the block, and we were there before noon. And if you know me, you know that I don't wait in lines. Well, this is a place that warrants it, so grab a friend, get there early, and strike up some conversation. I think we were expecting more of a Soup Nazi experience (order, move down, pay, leave) and less of a casual, unhurried, accommodating vibe. Doug was at the counter, nice as can be, and we ordered, paid and grabbed a table right under the uber-cool hot dog clock. There is also an outdoor patio, but you can't check out all of the hot dog paraphernalia from there. I'm a big fan of hot dog kitsch. I had the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. Legend has it that during the famous foie gras ban in Chicago, Doug's would continue to serve this delicacy and simply pay the $250 fine every month. Did I mention that I loved Doug? Oh and the sausage was divine - as if they had somehow captured a fine dining dish between two halves of a bun. Ellen M. had the Cherry & Apple Pork Sausage with Sweet Cherry Mustard, Goat Cheese, and Rum-Soaked Dried berries, which was heavenly. What a great combination - and again, worth every penny of the $8 price. Ellen's adorable mini-me had a regular hot dog, and if you are going to have one of these, be sure to check the options menu and know how you want it before ordering (grilled or steamed, condiments, etc). Great variety of drinks, including Dr. Brown's Celery and Cherry sodas. There were no duck fat fries on this day, but I have it on good authority that they just taste like the regular fries anyway (which were quite good). Doug's is an unusual, friendly, cheery place with creative specials and great food. Most of all (and you will rarely hear me say this), it's WORTH THE WAIT."
1191,"The one and only place in the entire known Universe where my Boyfriend can fufill his longtime fantasies of going to the counter and ordering ""The Salma Hayek and Kiera Knightley, to go, Please."" Every weekend. Not that I'm jealous, or anything... I can't compete with sausage anymore than he can compete with my beloved Jimmy Choo."
1192,"Simply the best Hot Dog Place in town. I know Doug doesn't like to be called a gourmet Sausage shop, but that is what make his place 100x better than every place else. The custom sausages. Lines are long, but amazing food."
1193,"Last person in Chicago to go to Hot Doug's: me. And 1269th person to review it on Yelp: yup, also me. Wait time: less than 40 minutes before noon on Thursday. Two hot dogs for breakfast: (1) foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli (2) corned beef sausage with Russian dressing, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese--both were pretty tasty, definitely A+ on creativity with flavors. Also had a taste of my friend's chipotle and cilantro smoked chicken sausage with pineapple-kiwi salsa and habanero-Jack cheese, not that impressed by that one. Didn't get to try the duck fat fries, but regular fries were soggy and kind of burnt...would skip it. Street parking is easy. Most important thing you need to know, it's CASH only."
1194,"Hot Doug's has almost 600 reviews so I'm going to make this short and sweet. Yes, you must go here and pop your HD cherry. I went this past Saturday for a Valentine's lunch. Waited over 40 minutes and I didn't mind at all. The duck fat fries are fabulous. I had duck fat coating my mouth that whole day. Gross, right? No, the fries are goooood! I had a chicken sausage with the works AKA, the Dave Kingman Italian style. My hubs had andoullie sausage with the works AKA, the Salma Hayek. Like the sign says, this dog is hot, hot, hot! I will be going back to try a few specials. I can't keep my mind off those duck fat fries! Keep in mind, it is cash only and there is no ATM on the premises."
1195,"I can't chime in and say much that hasn't been said before. . . worth the wait, sporty and 50's-y, awesome service and best food ever. But after today I had to write a review to pimp the Game of the Week - Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Rosemary-Garlic Mustard and Applewood-Smoked Cheddar Cheese. It just was unreal. The chunks of cheese and the mustard were the only things on it and there were completely perfect amounts of both. I don't know how he comes up with this perfect combinations. My group was debating about how funky the specials can get, but this game of the week was pretty simple, especially compared to my sort-of regular dog, the Marty Allen, a thurdinger chicago-style. Believe the hype, get over not wanting to wait, plus, this is perfect waiting weather. oh, see that picture of the cartoon hot dog with a with squiggly S of mustard? i was with a girl that has it tattoo'd on her leg. now that's hard core."
1196,"I'm not normally one to fall prey to mass hysteria, but in the case of Hot Doug's--believe the hype. Once you've put one of Doug's succulent wieners in your mouth, your life will change. With all honesty, if I had to choose how I was going to die, I would choose to choke to death on a Hot Doug's Wild Boar sausage. (Or possibly be stoned to death by the Polish.) The sh!t is that good."
1197,"We went on a week long trip to Chicago with some family and the only must do on our list was Hot Doug's. We had seen it on travel channel or food network and it sounded amazing so we went. I did not read my GPS correctly so we ended up on a subway, walking, then a bus, then walking more. Two hours later we got to Hot Doug's, and as everyone else has said the line was out the door and down the block. The line only took about 20 minutes.... When we got in Doug was working the counter, and even with his line around the block he took time to give us advise on the menu, and chat with us about his experience to AZ (where we are from). We got four hot dogs, 2 regular Chicago style hot dogs, a fire dog, and a Cognac chicken sausage.... SO GOOD and a cheese fry. It was really a great experience and we can't wait to go back to Chicago so we can go to Hot Doug's."
1198,"Whoever this ""doug"" guy is needs a swift kick to the junk. I'm sorry, but quite clearly this sadist just loves making people wait......the service could so easily be improved.....like have someone walk down the line taking orders....having more hours.....having a separate to go window or line....or having an entertainer out there, even a juggler, or here's a really wild one doug, how about having more than one person taking orders?! There's just too many options-obviously, the man loves watching everyone stand there for two hours, because the only way you can transform a HOT DOG into something really rave worthy is by making people wait two hours to eat it. At that point, your brain simply MUST rationalize the commitment, and a HOT DOG becomes worth waiting two hours in line for....... I mean, I liked everything I had...foie gras dog was good, chicago dog was excellent, and the garlic clove dog was good too....duck fat fries were decent, but I've certainly had better fries elsewhere. I'm all for ""slow food,"" and I can wait for food to be cooked fresh. But at the end of the day, you're eating a HOT DOG, from a man who loves to watch you all suffer and who could very VERY easily improve service. Sure, the line's there for a reason (because the food is good), but come on....if there wasn't a two hour wait, would the experience REALLY be all that memorable?! Somehow, this magician has transformed bad service into a feature of the restaurant....I guess it works for ed debevic's (but there you get your food in the first hour of waiting)..... Big props for the food, but you lose stars for the business model....if he's really so passionate about his food, you think he'd want to improve the overall dining experience for all of his loyal customers....."
1199,"Simply delightful, and yes, I think it might just live up to the hype. Not just ""going for a dog,"" this is more of an experience. I mean, geez, word gets around, the line was to the door practically 35 minutes before they were closing. For good reason, they got some good meats up in here! I love the primary colors dominating the decor, so appropriate in a hot dog place...ahem, excuse me, THE home of encased meats. I loved the friendly cashier: He asked ""Do you want your dog grilled or steamed?"" My response, ""uh, I don't know, whatever"" To which he replied, ""That is not the right thing to say, you need to ask me which is better."" I did, and he gave it to me. Oh yes, he gave it to me: one hot dog, a polish, and a Tuben. Mmmm, and an order of duck fat fries. Very tasty. Crispy, salty and just enough different to make you wonder, ""What's different about these fries?"" (These are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, however.) There were so many choices of creative-sounding sausages, but the Tuben was the choice for me. I'm a sucka for all things kraut and cheesy. It delivered, that's for sure. Free refills on pop, and we were in encased meat heaven. Next time you want it, head over to Hot Dougs...trust me, they will give it to you."
1200,"What's that? You can actually walk up to Doug's, open the door, and walk inside? Apparently the answer is Yes, on a drizzly Wednesday at 11:10 am, when a work crew is reconstructing the curb and sidewalk around the entire corner. Actually, the construction probably had nothing to do with it, but it did add to the strangeness of the scene, namely--NO WAIT at Hot Doug's! Well, there was a line inside of about ten people. Child's play. Thanks to having people in town, deflowering virgins, and various other unusual occasions, I've made it to Doug's four times so far in 2009! Way better than my average. That includes my birthday, because on my birthday I want to do my very favorite things, and that describes Hot Doug's for sure. A day off work, some great company, yummy yummy sausages, and NO WAIT--utter bliss."
1201,"If this place were *JUST* a Chicago-dog joynt, it would be worthy of 5 stars for what it is. It is, however, NOT *JUST* a Chicago-dog joynt. The daily selection of gourmet sausages, replete with gourmet fixins, are just incredible. Invariably I have a hard time choosing so end up getting 2-3 and saving the others for later. 2 tips: 1) Check their website before you go - do NOT make Doug wait while you decide! 2) Ask Doug to grill your gourmet encased meat. If you can go around or before noon or after 2pm on a weekday, no lines."
1202,"I dream of Hot Doug's. Seriously. I've never been disappointed. But I refuse to go on weekends (not like I could go even if I wanted to because I work Saturdays). And when I do go on my weekday off - I don't go until about 2pm, after the lunch rush. I really wish this place was open later. Or at least on Sunday. Get with the post-industrial capitalist society Hot Doug's!"
1203,"There's always a line, but it's worth it if you like encased meats. There are many crazy things on the menu, and your wait in line won't be worth it if you don't try something new. You will have ""missed the point"". The duck fat fries are not that amazing, but if you want to try them just to check that off your bucket list, go ahead. Check the weather and prepare appropriately for a 1+ hr wait in line. DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS. Seriously, just don't. They have a small dining room that is not built for strollers, and kids don't want to wait in line an hour for a hot dog. Do everyone a favor (I'm talking to you, Mrs. Breastfeeding-At-The-Table-Across-From-Me)"
1204,"Duck fat fries on weekends. Madonna & Britney, everyday. Yum. Encased meat rules here where Mr. (Hot) Doug defied the city's foolish foie gras ban to make sure carnivores got what they deserved. This hot dog sit down joint with the oddest location imaginable - across from a electricity hub (think overhead wires) is the best place to taste what should be the future of the pup on the bun. I love the specials that give me the chance for tastes hard to otherwise imagine always with timely, relevant names. Fascinating posters and pictures on the walls that detail the history of the hot dog. Wish they took credit cards, but with Doug ""It's straight cash, homey."" Besides the cuisine, Doug - the man at the register - makes Hot Doug's a friendly place to dig a dog. No ketchup please."
1205,"Silly me-I was under the impression that Deep Dish was what Chicago is known for, but apparently it is Hot Dogs, Hot Dogs Hot Dogs. We drove by Hot Doug's the other day and my sister explained to me that they are who to see for a real Chiacgo Dog. I have never been much of a hot dog fan but wanted to give these a try. It was explained to me to bundle up and plan on waiting in the cold for awhile. I prepared myself and headed down there. Luckily, we hit Doug's at a pretty good time, only waiting about 10 minutes. I was told that it is the type of place that you should know what you are ordering before you arrive or you will piss off the locals by holding up the line. Because of this, I studdied the online menu and to figure out exactly what I was getting. (I am a local now and did not want to piss off my own kind!) When we got closer to the front, I realized this is not the case. The man taking the orders truly takes his time and helps with any questions and sugestions his customers may have. He was to the point, but did not make his guests feel rushed at all. I think that this is what creates the line... I had the the Jalapeno-Cheese Sausage, topped with Jalapeno Mayo, Pepperjack Cheese and fresh Cilantro. It was WAY RICH and WAY DELICIOUS. Next time I think I would opt for less mayo and cheese and to add fresh tomato and extra cilantro instead, to make it a little less rich. The dog had a perfect kick to it and left a great spice in my mouth. We also shared a large order of fries which were equally wonderful. I had heard about the Duck Fat Fries and was sad to see that they are on weekends only. I guess i will have to go back!"
1206,"My dear, darling Doug... I am fucking hot for you. And your sweet sausage."
1207,"Yeah, I know that Doug's is the most Yelped place in Chicago, so why even bother writing another review of it? Because it really does deserve all the praise. I had a friend in from out of town who was a long-time, very dedicated vegetarian. When he came to Doug's, he decided to throw all of his beliefs out the window and eat a rattlesnake sausage. That is what Hot Doug's has the power to do: turn you from a whiny, limp-wristed, plant eating sissy boy into a genuine, bad-ass, snake eating mother fucker."
1208,"NOW I KNOW WHY THEY DON'T HAVE FOIE GRAS EATING CONTESTS That stuff is RICH! Even Kobayashi and Chestnut couldn't scarf down more than a few of Doug's famous duck sausages with foie gras and black truffle butter. It was so intensely decadent that I think my heart literally skipped a beat. No really, I thought I was going to die for a second. Luckily my ticker rebooted and my paranoia subsided and I kept right on eating. If you haven't tried this $8 indulgence, I say go for it, but split it with a friend. Equally thrilling was the Marty Allen (thuringer). Char-grilled to perfection and prepared Chicago-style, this was one of the best dogs I've ever had. My only regret was that it wasn't a Friday or Saturday so I could try the duck fat fries."
1209,"So far the best chicago dog I've had. Fried and grilled is a must. yummy $1.50 corn dogs. DELICIOUS FRIES!!! It is one of those places you must experience. If a girl from sunny california can wait in a line during winter, so can you!"
1210,Worth the 1-hr wait and I enjoyed the folks I was in line with. Service inside was pretty quick and there's a steady rotation of folks sitting down so that nobody was left without a seat at any given time. Definitely a unique hot dog experience. I enjoyed the rabbit sausage and duck fat fries. Yum!
1211,"I've been waiting years to try this place and I finally did! I thought I'd be smart and phone in an order at 10:30 on a Friday morning. I waited less than 10 minutes for my order once I arrived. I went with the Merguez lamb sausage with feta and chili-garlic mayo and, of course, the duck fat fries. I kicked myself for not eating here sooner. Delicious doesn't even begin to cover it. The BEST sausage and fries I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try more. I'm hooked, Doug. You got me."
1212,"Hoooooooo mama! THAT is some freakin' MEAT right there! I've lived pretty close by for almost 4 years and have never made it here because I don't stand in line for nothin'. Finally got motivated on a weekday to head over there before 11 AM and beat the lunch rush. There was a little line, but it went quick. Was ordering for a few so we got the hot dog, thuringer, polish, and a jerk pork sausage with plantains. It was relatively cheap considering all of it was of the highest quality, and I mean all of it. Whoo! The cheese fries were good but were way overshadowed by the meat. I would maim everyone in this room for another polish from Hot Doug's. Right now. Worth the wait, I will be back for sure."
1213,"I firmly believe that there's nothing I can say about Doug's that hasn't already been said. In fact, I bet that someone has already written the EXACT sentence I just wrote. We all know that Hot Doug's provides the greatest sausage concoctions ever. EVER. Inarguable. So I thought I'd take a second to focus on the negatives. 1.) Hot Doug's is over 400 miles from my home. Even if I fly to Chicago, get in a cab, get to Hot Doug's and wait in line, I can't have a sausage for probably 3 hours. 3 hours is a long time to wait for this goodness. 2.) I have friends who live in Chicago who have never been to Doug's. This is inexcusable. It's like living in Paris and never seeing the Mona Lisa, it's like living in Cairo and saying, 'man, those pyramids are just TOO far away,' it's like living in Amsterdam and never contracting an STD in the Red Light District. 3.) I know people who plan trips to Chicago, and at my insistence, promise to go to Doug's. When they get back, they say, 'oh, my grandma was having heart surgery in Wheaton and we just couldn't find the time.' Fuck your grandmother. You FIND the time. 4.) The hours are limited. This is self-explanatory. I'm not advocating a 3am close. You can't truly appreciate Doug's unless you're of sound mind and body. Plus, late-night hot-dog places breed animalistic tendencies. I don't want a 'vanilla milkshake,' wherein Doug bares his breasts for $20. Go to Wiener's Circle at 3 in the morning. Enjoy. It would be nice, though, if I could have dinner at Doug's. 5.) Hot Doug's is over 400 miles from my home. This is a big one. If I could marry a sausage-emporium, it would definitely be Hot Doug's. I'd treat her right, make sweet love to her and have little half-human/ half-sausage monster-babies. Then, we'd have to kill them in infancy. And eat them. Because I bet they'd taste pretty great too."
1214,"Yummmm....hot dogs. Specialty hot dogs, even better! What can I say that hasn't been said before. All of their dogs are AWESOME! I still would recommend one of the fire dogs or super fire dogs with chili on top. It's a spicy classic that they do well. It obviously won't compare to the specialty dogs, but worth a bite or two. Personally I don't think the duck fat fries are unbelievable. They are good, but I honestly like M Burger's and other similar places a little more. But hey, if you are there on a weekend, why not indulge!"
1215,"Perfectly cheesy decor. Quick attentive service. Good prices. Great food. We went here right out of the gate. The gate at the airport. Our first culinary experience in Chi-town and we still had to wait though we got here 5 mins before they opened and the line was already 30-40 people deep. 45 mins later we had ordered our food and what a happy experience it was. We ordered 4 dogs. Marsala and Roasted Garlic Wild Boar Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese , the famous Foie Gras, Venison, and the Saucisse de Toulouse with Sauce Moutarde and Truffle Affinois Cheese. Our clear favorites were the wild boar and Foie Gras followed up by the Toulouse Sausage, leaving the venison as our least favorite. The wild boar dawg was delicious as the bacon garlic mayo was a perfect compliment to the boar and the cheese smoothed it out. The Foie Gras was the funnest. Yes I said funnest. It was a duck sausage that was topped with four sliced pieces of smooth Foie gras the sausage was delicious but the Foie Gras completely made it a gourmet experience. For me the Toulouse sausage was a bit to overwhelmed by the mustard and Venison was far to strong a meat for a tasty dog. We also ordered the Duck Fat Fries which did not leave me thinking that it was the holy grail of fries. But the were good. Chicagoans are very lucky to have this place. I have dawg envy."
1216,"From its red brick exterior, Hot Doug's Sausage Superstore, has the same gravitas and appeal as the back of Wrigley Field. There's character there. Moxie. History. It's a working man's brick. You know that only a few feet away greatness waits. But unlike the Cubs, Doug Sohn's crew at Hot Doug's really does perform like a world class team. To say that Hot Doug's is a hot dog stand is like saying ""Chicago is a big city"". It's true. But both Chicago and Hot Doug's are much, much more. Hot Doug's does serve the standard fare of the typical Chicago dog stand, but like the Art Institute's ever changing collections, it's the ever changing selection of gourmet sausages that make Doug's different. And it's not just the encased meats that are gourmet. Sometimes the toppings are as much of a treat as the sausage itself. Imagine the savoriness of a jerk pork sausage served on soft and chewy French roll, dressed with a spicy passion fruit mayonnaise, sauted sweet plantain, and a Crme de Brie cheese served with a large helping of Duck Fat Fries (served only on Friday and Saturday). Or what about the richness of spinach and the bite of feta in a gyros sausage topped with a tapenade mayonnaise and Kasseri cheese? Definitely hold the ketchup. Or even the dog that got Doug into trouble: a Sauterne-infused duck sausage topped with foie gras. Served during Chicago's short-lived ban of foie gras, it garnered Hot Doug's the only fine levied during the entire ban. And thanks in no small part to Doug's drive to make gourmet affordable, the fine pointed out the absurdity of Chicago's food ban, and struck a blow for common sense. And that's the other thing that's so great about Hot Doug's. It's pure Chicago. You'll take a seat next to a table of game designers from the nearby offices of Midway Games. On the other side will be a table of roughnecks from ComEd on their lunch break. Hipsters will be sitting next to cube dwellers, who are sitting next to tourists, who are sitting across from suburb visitors from Naperville, and everyone is having a good time. From the primary colors, to the faux sausage facts, to Doug greeting each customer, everything at Hot Doug's seems to bring a smile to your face. The atmosphere is the appetizer, and the final fun condiment on each order served. The one thing you will have to reconcile is the wait. Open from 10:30am to 4:00pm Monday through Saturday, locals will cheerfully wait 45 minutes to an hour in some of the worst Chicago weather for Hot Doug's. You should too. But unlike Cub fans who wrestle with the uncertainty of whether or not this will be be ""the year"", you can relish the knowledge that dining victory is yours."
1217,"I gotta say these are the fanciest hot dogs I have ever eaten. They are also the ONLY hot dogs I have stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes for! It was hilarious that the people directly behind me and ahead of me werent even from Chicago! The couple in front of me had landed into Chicago from LA and decided to come straight to Hot Doug's from Ohare. Thats craziness. The guys behind me came from Louisville, KY and headed to Hot Dougs after getting lost in Gary, IN. Thats lunacy. But our curiosity for these hot dogs bonded us together! The variety this place has is amazing. They have 11 items on their menu not including the specials. I tried the Thai spicy sausage with seaweed salad. It was SPICY! But very tasty. The sauce also had some wasabi in it. I'm not a fan of wasabi but was very impressed at how the flavors of everything meshed. I also ordered the cheese fries. I had a taste of the duck fried fries and I personally thought the cheese fries were better than the regular duck fries. But hey, anything fried cant be bad right? The place is small but the atmoshere was very nice. It didnt feel too crowded at all in the confined area we were in. A great tourist attraction! I would definitely come back on a warmer day to try some of the other hot dogs."
1218,"The snake is long Seven miles Ride the snake Yeah the line was long. But, totally worth it. Got to meet up with a bunch of cool Yelpers and snack on some encased meats. I was one for two with my choices. Meh on the Banger and touchdown on the spicy Sonoran. After all these reviews, if there's anything that I can add it's that I don't think I saw anyone drinking Dr. Brown's other than me. I don't know if it's an East Coast thing. Folks you are seriously missing out on that stuff. You'll want to add that to your next order. There's my good deed of the day."
1219,"Pros: Amazing Chicago-style dog, very friendly staff, very filling meal. I will go back next time I'm in Chicago! Cons: Waiting in 18 degree wind for over an hour. I will say, if you are hung over, stay away from the Foie Gras dog- it is way too rich."
1220,"I am now completely in love with encased meats! I recently went to Chicago to visit a high school friend. When she asked me what were some of the ""Chicago"" things that I wanted to see and do the first thing on my list was Hot Doug's. I told her I didn't care how long I had to wait or how far away it was; I wanted those wonderful encased meats in my belly. I think I about jumped through the roof when she told me she only lived about 5 blocks from it. I arrived in the evening on Thursday and we decided we would get up early on Friday and try to beat the line. We arrived at 10:48am and started at the back of the brick building. Luckily it was a cooler day, about 80 degrees, and the line actually moved fairly quickly. We reached the counter at 11:38am (40 minutes, not too bad of a wait for the encased meats of my dreams). I was surprised to find the owner, Doug, taking our order. He was very very polite and actually animated which I did not expect to find since there is a constant flowing line of people from the time they open at 10:30am until the time they close at 4pm. Before I left home my BF told me that I had to try something that we would not normally find at a basic hot dog stand. I think he did this so that he could vicariously taste the encased meats through me. So, when I got there and realized the Game of the Week was Alligator, I almost turned around and left, but knew what I would be missing out on. I told my friend that she had to try it with me. So, we ordered the Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and St. Pete's Blue Cheese ($8.50), the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions ($8) and The Sally Vega, which is a corn dog ($1.50). One of the surprises was that it only took about 4 minutes to receive our order and they bring it out to your table. Another surprise was that I liked the Gator a lot more than the Ribeye. The Gator is hard to describe but it was a mild flavor (not chicken), maybe similar to pork, but still different. With the first bite, I realized that the blue cheese was far too overwhelming for the Gator and my friend agreed. We both wiped all of it off. All it really needed was the Cajun Remoulade. The blue cheese was just too rich and I didn't like how it masked the flavor of the Gator. The Ribeye was tasty but I felt like it was too rich. I had split this one with my friend as well and I couldn't finish even the half. However, the Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions went perfectly with it. The only disappointment was The Sally Vega. It was nothing special. I felt like it was just another frozen corn dog that I could buy at the supermarket. When we left I laughed when I saw the Ice Cream truck that many other people had spoke about in their reviews. He found the perfect money making spot, especially when people are waiting an hour to an hour and a half on a hot day. Hot diggity Doug, I will be back the next time I come to Chicago and I'm bringing the BF."
1221,"We all know how amazing the food at Hot Doug's is, so instead of a full review, I want to share a quick story about Doug Sohn. One day last summer, my girlfriend and I drove around looking for a place to eat until, after much deliberation, we decided that we were craving some Hot Doug's. Since the idea to go to Hot Doug's was a very last minute decision, I didn't have cash on me (cash only at Hot Doug's), and worst of all, I was wearing a Superdawg shirt. Instead of doing what most smart people would do (change my shirt and go to an ATM), I decided to venture into Hot Doug's anyways. As I anticipated, Doug really let me have it for wearing a Superdawg shirt. After a few well deserved jabs, I awkwardly laughed it off and ordered my food without a hitch. Then it was time for me to pay for our meal. When I realized that my girlfriend and I only had $9 in cash between us at the time, I told Doug to cancel our order so I could run to the ATM for some cash. Instead of hearing the response that I was expecting, Doug told me, ""Don't worry about paying now. Eat your meal first and then run to the ATM for some cash."" I've only been to Hot Doug's a few times before that trip, but I will forever be a loyal customer after that experience. Doug Sohn not only makes the best sausages in Chicago, but he is also a class-act guy!"
1222,"I'm sure I could say a million things that have already been said, but I won't. My boyfriend and I are here every Saturday (no, we don't weigh 5,000 pounds collectively), and Doug knows the boyfriend by name. The specials are always killer (I do the chicken sausages) and the fries are to die for. But I have two things to say to all future visitors of Doug's: 1) This place is NOT good for groups. The biggest tables sit six people, max. Not to mention that groups larger than this eat up the space. If you can split yourselves up, more power to you. Otherwise, don't bring your entire extended family from the suburbs. 2) This place is NOT good for people with strollers. Strap that baby holder on and leave the stroller in the car. There was a couple with TWO strollers (for three kids) in line today. When they got to the door they finally said out loud, ""Maybe we shouldn't take the strollers inside."" Really? No kidding? Hot Doug's is a SMALL, small little joint. There's roughly 10 tables. No strollers, darn't! The lines are always unbelievably long, and there isn't any space for your strollers! Oh, and my final gripe to visitors of Doug's (and especially the suburbanites who see Doug's as a tourist attraction)? When you're done, LEAVE. GET UP AND LEAVE. Don't dawdle. Don't read the sports page. Don't examine the meaning of life or consider all the silly jokes you could stay to the people waiting in line (""Sorry guys! They're out of sausages! -- which someone says every, flippin', week ...). JUST GET UP, CLEAR YOUR TABLE, AND LEAVE. LEAVE! Why? Because on any given day, the flow of people is constant. Especially on Saturdays. And that, folks, is a quick tidbit of Hot Doug's advice. The food? Well, it speaks for itself. And Doug? He does the same. Respect the man. Respect the restaurant. Respect the signs he posts. Respect the space. Or go home!"
1223,"Before today, I hadn't been since this place was in Roscoe Village, but that's not for lack of trying. If you want all your problems solved, make friends with Jenny Z. She makes dreams come true. This would be her theme song if it weren't so horrible: http://www.youtube.com/w"
1224,"I have never voluntarily waited for anything so long in my life. I got there at 1:25 PM and finally ordered at 3:40 PM. The only time I ever waited for anything near this long was a 100 minute wait for the Rock 'n Roller Coaster Ride at MGM. But, I guess I have to make my review independent of the insanely long line since it's not really their fault. One thing that could speed the line up is if the ordering process was more like the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld. But, Doug's friendly and chatty attitude is also a feature of the store. I was so famished by the time I got to order that my friend and I shared 6 sausages and a large order of Duck Fat Fries. We've been psyched about the duck fat fries ever since we saw it on Bourdain. They were amazing. Nothing transcendental, but definitely an amazing taste that proves it's a definite better medium for frying potatoes. As far as the sausages go, I tried the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris, the Paul Kelly- a Beer soaked bratwurst with all the Chicago dog trimmings, The Elvis- a Polish sausage, Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Vintage Cheddar Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves, Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions, and the Saucisse de Toulouse with Anchovy Goat's Milk Butter and Montsegur Peppercorn Cheese. Here's my order of my favorites: 1. The Uber Garlic Sausage 2. The Duck Sausage with Foie Gras 3. The Paul Kelly 4. The Elvis 5. The Ribeye with horseradish 6. The Saucisse de Toulouse with Goat Milk butter I have to say that everyone should try the top two. I LOVED them. The Uber garlic sausage was like a dream come true for me as I'm a garlic lover. I love huge chunks of roasted garlic and had no idea that it would go so perfectly with Pork Sausage. The duck sausage with foie gras mousse was incredible. The taste of the sausage was juicy and bloody and the mousse was the perfect creamy foil to the hot sausage. No description will do it justice, you just have to try it. It's also worth going on Friday and Saturday to try the fries that were fried in rendered duck fat, but on those days expect an even longer wait. I think your best bet to avoid the wait would be to go on a Monday and be there half an hour before open. Forget about showing up right before close because I witnessed personally that the line does not die down as you reach 4 PM. I think you probably will have a better chance going early. I do not regret waiting because the sausages are world class and different from everything you've ever had before. The opportunity to try wild game is one that should not be passed. But, I have to admit, I was slowly losing my mind listening to chattering knuckleheads for 2 hours taking pictures of themselves standing in line."
1225,"Definitely lived up too the hype. Though standing in line for over an hour to get two hot dogs will never be on my favorite things to do list. If your in Chicago, this is a must, though be prepared to wait. The line bends around the corner down the street."
1226,Three words- Duck Fat Fries. These were heaven for a pregnant lady. That plus the ability to convince my husband to go here and wait in line for them while I sat at home on the couch.
1227,"Yeah, so what else can I say? Add another one to the growing tally of 5 star reviews. Hot Doug's is delicious. Yey for veggie dogs, Yey for awesome fries, and Yey for delicious toppings. SO.. yum. eat here. If you have already, go back."
1228,Hmmmm hot dogs! Hmmmmm hot dogs with ketchup and mustard! (The way God thought they should be made) And hooray for Mr. Doug because he didn't laugh at me when I ordered my dog this way. My hot dog was super delicious and yummy. There really are no words (or at least words that haven't already been used by all the people that have already reviewed Hot Dougs's) to describe just how yummy this hot dog was...for once I think I am speechless! Oh and the duck fat fries are to die for! ZOMG! So yummy and so good! Definitely worth the hour wait in line and the whole time I couldn't believe I was standing there and was hoping the food would deliver. And it did! Go...now...run!!!!!!!!!!!! Go get your hot dog!!!!!
1229,"I went here with high expectations and think the hype is overrated. I ordered the dog with all the trimmings and that was a good hot dog. I also ordered the Frankie ""five angels"" and went with the suggestion of the worker which had onions and mustard and some other stuff. This was a bit too spicy and overall not what I thought it would taste like. It probably would have been better if I stuck with everything on it. The staff is very friendly and helpful, even gave use peppers for our dogs. 20 minute wait wasn't too bad. Had I waited over an hour, I would have been disappointed with the food. Definitely try this place out, probably have better success than me when ordering different trimmings."
1230,"My fiancee just HAD to go here for ""fine"" dining lunch. One hour before it closed on Saturday (closing is 4 pm by the way), we found ourselves waiting in a line that curled around the corner. We waited for about twenty minutes and once we were inside the doors, the restaurant could have used some better ventilation, 'twas smoky from the grill! The point is - always expect a wait. We even showed up at 10:30 (opening) and we waited for fifteen minutes. OK OK, I'll be nice. I ordered the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Pear Creme Fraiche and Toasted Hazelnuts $7 and as it was VERY delectable; it was more of a $5 meal. Yes, the Duck Fat Fries were great -- but for $3.50 -- you can fry anything in reused vegetable oil and it tastes pretty damn good. Doug, who is very friendly (having a million dollar business must help! ;) ) was working the ordering counter, the tip jar looked as if it was only for the other staffers which was more incentive to tip & the wait staff was quick at clearing tables during the busy rush for the next customer. Next time, I'll stick with the plain ol fries. I swear the Duck Fat Fries kinda tasted the same as the plain ones after Fry # 15 and I'll show up at 3:46 pm when nobody is in line. That way I can enjoy my dog and a conversation without feeling like I was being scooted out."
1231,"Obligatory Hot Dougs review time. How have I waited four years to try this place? Honestly, the thought of a 45 minute wait to experience Doug Sohn's sausage creations had me mighty skeptical. I picked yesterday, a Thursday, after lunch when I had a free moment to avoid the lines an see if this place was for real. It's FO'REAL! Walk in and prepare yourself for overstimulation. Once inside, you have about a minute to review a wall of encased meat selections ranging different meats, cheeses, styles and preparations -- no easy task if you like just about everything. Want a simple Chicago Dog? You're covered. Andouille sausage more your thing? Get it on. How about an Artichoke-Parmesan Chicken Sausage with Artichoke-Cumin Pure and Marieke Fenugreek Cheese? Hey, it's on special today! Along with about a dozen other zany creations listed on their website, updated daily. Maybe the best ordering approach is to do your research before heading over. Otherwise, you feel like a schmuck when you get to the front of the line with a dumbfounded look on your face, much like I did yesterday. I was fortunate, Hot Dougs isn't just a vast wonderland of encased meat selections, but is also home to one of the friendliest staffs I've encountered. Doug himself takes your order at the counter, and amidst the frenetic pace of order-taking and filling, still takes time to answer questions, show a smile and thank you for stopping in. I threw a few taste preferences at him. Spicy, smoky, cheesy and crispy? He was happy to recommend a spicy pork sausage, soaked in Cherry Coke, grilled to a crisp and topped with provolone and barbecue sauce. ""And don't forget,"" he added, ""get your cup and help yourself to free refills."" It's silly. Make me some good food, treat me like you're happy I'm here, and I'm sold on you for life. I'm sooo easy. Overstimuli continues at your table. Between the sausage mongering, the hustle and bustle, the soundtrack above is something out of that college rock station overnight show you felt bad-ass listening to. The walls are covered in Elvis merch, signed local celeb photos and shrines to the art of the hot dog. Check out the pictorial history of encased meats. Who knew that Hot Dogs were present at the dawn of humanity, the Roman Empire and during the moon landing?! Funny stuff. Did I mention that my sausage was perfect? Holy crap. Crispy, flavorful and gooey with melted provolone. I didn't get to try the duck fat fries (head up: only served on Friday's and Saturdays), but their everyday fries are delicious, complete with the skins and tasting like they just came out of a back-yard deepfryer! Unreal. I'll be back, if only to creep my way through the expansive menu. We are fortunate to have such creativity in this city. Judging by Doug's daily updates to the menu, this mad scientist of the sausage is still full of ideas."
1232,"I've tried to get to this place to see what the ""hype"" was about 3 times now. Each time there is a freakin' line down the block. Are you kidding me? NO hot dog & fry is THAT good to wait in line for 30 minutes! Come on people! Just because everyone brags about it doesn't mean you have to go here too! It's like a restaurant that is on ""Check Please"". Oh my....once you're on that show.......let the lines and curiosity begin!! But I finally decided to wait it out last week...........I had my ipod on and stood in line like the rest of the fools. Well i was off work so I had the day to myself! The dog, was a hot dog. It was good....nothing special but it was OK. It's a HOT DOG! The fries were good though. Bottom line......I am sorry, its not like i am waiting in line for a fine dining experience for a nice steak or Italian dinner! You're getting a freakin' hot dog and fry! I will not wait 30 minutes again for a dog.........that's just nuts! Sorry guys!"
1233,"I know one person that hates Hot Dougs, but he's a sociopathic maniac. I'm gonna write this review in fragments. Okay. - Doug, good dude. - Game of the Week. The Mountain Man. Antelope, Buffalo, Elk, Venison (boar, deer, caribou, etc). All together having a wild time in your stomach. - Excellent beverage selection - Chubby people - Thuringer sausage named ""The Don Rickles"". That's all I needed. Eat here sparingly, so your body isn't angry at you. HAIL DOUGS!!"
1234,"You will wait. This wait can be a fun group experience, or at least a chance to catch up with your friends. Unless you came alone. Either way, the food makes it worth it. The menu is wonderfully ridiculous. Doug puts together food combinations I didn't know I wanted until I read the specials. It changes constantly, and I make it an effort to try something different every time I visit, and I have not ever been let down. Not once. The eclectic menu would not be worth much if it didn't translate to good food, but fortunately, it does. Seriously, every time I go, I'm savoring it for the rest of the day. It's that good. It's why I, and the many patrons who visit put up with the sometimes insane lines. Oh, and Friday & Saturday, they have Duck Fat Fries. You have to try the Duck Fat Fries. The place is also full of character and charm. It has these attributes in droves. If you don't like it, I attribute it to a fault in character. You and I could not be friends."
1235,"Final Score of my second trip to Doug's: Foie Gras Duck Sausage: 1 Me: 0 Ooooh, sweet surrender!"
1236,"I've been feeling kinda homesick for Chicago and was thinking of putting together a list of my favorites, but while perusing my reviews realized that I never did review a number of my very favorite Chicago places. Probably the most glaring omission is Hot Doug's. People in Reno always ask me if I miss Chicago, and the answer is yes and no. I don't miss the congestion, traffic, expense and the flat, flat landscape. I do miss the shopping, my friends, the live music venues, but mostly I miss the restaurants. Certainly I miss the high end, foodie places like Lula Cafe, but even more I miss the awesome cheap eats that Chicago REALLY excels at. Hot Doug's, to me, marries the best of high end and low end. It's a hot dog joint for certain, but it's elevated to the point of art. Encased meats as art? Hell F***ing YES! Duck Fat Fries. YES, awesome. But the regular fries are spectacular as well. Fancy gourmet confections like lamb and mint dogs with gooey melted cheese. Yes, please. But, I always, always have to have a regular dog with the works Chicago style in addition to everything else. Have to. I have never had a single thing at Hot Doug's that wasn't best of class. And Doug himself is a true gem and grand citizen of Chicago, right up there with Da Mayor himself. I love how when you order a large pop he'll suggest you order a small instead and just get refills if you're eating on the premises. The lines are legendary, but the wait is totally worth it. Go hungry, but not ravenous, because you will probably be waiting an hour or more. By the time you order you will be ravenous, and a fancy selection, a regular dog, large fries and a pop will be the best thing you might ever eat. And now I'm just a little bit more homesick. *tear*"
1237,"I think I just might propose to ""the lady* here. The venison and wild boar dogs were simply delicious! Thank you Doug for promoting biological diversity! *""The lady"" has yet to be found :-/"
1238,"Get in line at about 11:10 and watch as the oppressive sun flies over and precipitates beads of sweat formulating on my brow. Backed up by nearly 75 people, I am not even in the alley - the line is that long. The sidewalk is torn, shattered from the millions of people who have stood in my place and slowly shuffled along to get reach encased meat nirvana. An ice cream truck parked near the alley, no childrens' song blaring and no bells ringing. We go up and order ice cream to escape the oppression. Helping myself to a pre-Hot Doug's meat session, I hit up an Oreo ice cream bar and pay the man $2.00. In minutes, the ice cream was gone and I flipped open a locked garbage bin and chucked the remnants in. As we crawled through the line the anticipation for entering the Garden of Eden of encased meats heightened as I looked inside the window, saw people trying to slowly shuffle in and dominate some sausages! A foolish neophyte attempted to stroll in to grab himself a menu, but his application was denied! We crept past one door, and then were behind the air conditioned door, waiting for the gap in the line to form so we could bum rush it! And yes, it was to be - one hour of waiting had paid off! My friends all ordered before me, I then discovered that the Hotdougs on Twitter was not Doug, and he said that is how far his celebrity now went that there were impersonators on Twitter! Regardless of this fact, I ordered grilled Elk sausage with Honker's Ale mustard, with two cheeses, a Keira Knightley spicy dog, duck fat fries and a large drink. Yep, I really spent over $17 on this trip, but I do not care - for encased meat nirvana, I'd do anything! We hauled out one by one and headed to the river nearby to sit by the bank and watch barrels pass by on this blazing afternoon day. My friend had one bite of his veggie dog and was gagging. He declared and then I affirmed that Doug had messed up, Doug had ripped my friend off! Not so fast! I then took a bite out of his disputed veggie dog and declared that it was not meat, that the muscle fibers were not there to break down and that my friend himself had just bitten into the world's greatest veggie dog!!!!!!!!!!! I then unwrapped a white package that said ELK and started to go to town on encased elk meat. The flavors from the elk, the mustard, the two layers of cheese affirmed that Doug is the all-time master of bundling random game and making it a dog from the gods. Whatever so Doug shalt wrap, thou shalt be satisfied. The Knightley was spicy and the duck fries with cheese did not soggy up. That my friends, is an hour well spent."
1239,"yes, there's 31412.21341 hotdogs to choose from, but 30+ minute wait? fuck that, not worth it."
1240,"I used to work across the street from Doug's Encased Mmeat Palace and I ate here fairly frequently. And I have to admit one of the proudest moments of my adult life was when he looked up from his pad and said to me ""What will you have Sadie?"" He knew my name! And my name never sounded so sweet as when Hot Doug uttered it. So yeah, I had a bit of a crush on Doug, but who can blame me? He's creative, smart and runs a tight ship. And those nipsterish glasses, ohlala. Oh, so you want to hear about the food? The fries are crisp and tasty, and he offers tater tots as well, which are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The duck frites are all that that you've heard, and more. I normally ordered the Elvis-a polish with onions and mustard or a corndog, both of which I loved. I stayed away from the fancy dogs but if that's your think then you should definitely try them. Be prepared to wait, but Justin and the others do a great job of finding you a table, so don't worry about how busy it is, if you want to eat there, you will be able to do so. And believe it or not, if you want to go when its not busy, get there right at noon. It normally gets busier around 12:15 or so. And he carries fun Dr. Brown soda flavors like Celery. Ok, I don't drink it, but it's kinda cool knowing its around."
1241,"Here's what you need to know: Everyone says that you are going to wait in a long long line. On a Friday or Saturday, that is true. Go on a weekday and you are likely not to wait more than ten or fifteen minutes! Hot Doug's is hidden. People need to search to find it. It is a mecca in a barren land of large manufacturing/electric companies. It is only open 10:30-4pm. Check out their website for what is going to be on the menu that day. You can go one week and have a completely different experience the next week. You can order ahead and pick up if you order more than $25. If you have 2 or 3 people ordering, that shouldn't be a problem. Everything that everyone else says is true. You will not regret this. My highlight last time: white wine rabbit sausage with caprese peppers and goat cheese."
1242,"Disclaimer: I am writing this rating based on what I ordered. I had the dog and the Keira, everything on. I also ordered chili and cheese on the side. The dog was perfect. I loved everything on it. Also, the meat works well with the chili and cheese. The Keira is good just by itself and the bread. A note about the chili and cheese: the chili is a little watery but if you cover it with cheese, it'll hold together and not drip. I really loved how this place is cheap. It's quite far if you're a tourist. Also, be prepared to wait. Overall, I had a good experience. Use the restrooms if you can... Hehe."
1243,"Gah I think this is meat heaven. We have friends in town who alerted us to the call ahead option, yeah that rocked. I made the pilgrammage on our last trip into the city. I came in search of duck fat fries and holy mother of &%@$# were they happy. I could not stop eating them until they were gone. I had a super garlicy pork sausage with spicy mustard, garlic cloves and horseradish cheddar and a buffalo sausage with serendipity cheese that were possibly the best sausages I have ever eaten, so full of flavor and spice. I am drooling at the memory here. I of course could not eat it all but man was it as good later too, I figured I might as well get both as I could not decide and live 5 hours away. My husband stuck boring and traditional with cheese fries and a couple of cheesed up brats but they were very tasty as well. He was very happy and actually looked a bit appalled at my choices to be frank. Yep I will be back. I think it's almost sweeter to live so far away so you can really appreciate them when you are here."
1244,"What can I say that hasn't already been said, not much, but here I go. A coworker stopped in today and brought it out to the burbs. He said the line was only to the door, so that is good. We ordered about 8 ""hot dougs"" and everyone said it was good. I tried the Aligator and the Rib sausage. I had half of each and that was more than enough to fill me up. Both were pretty good but I like the gator one a little better. Fries were good. It is expensive but worth it to try something different. Certainly not an every week sort of thing."
1245,"This is not just the best hot dog I have ever had, it is quite possibly the best meal of my life. I was totally blown away by the quality of this dog, And the duck fat fries were incredible. around and really experience my trip. I waited in line for almost 2.5 hours on saturday and I would do it again, In fact i would wait in line all day to have this again. The line was very long but I am glad it was because they do not rush people in and out. They take the time to get you a place to sit down and enjoy your food without feeling rushed out the door. To me this was the biggest plus because for all of the wait I was given a chance to look around and really experience my trip. If you are planning on going to Hot Dougs, which you would be insane not too, go when they open at 10:30, even though I did not mind waiting inline i will plan my next trip better to get there a bit earlier. And on a final note. I thought it was a typo when I seen that ""The Dog"" with everything was only $1.75!"
1246,"ORIGINALLY REVIEWED JAN 27 2006 - this review below is from January 7, 2008 on a balmy day in Chicago A truly great idea and a wonderful place to eat, a very cool place to get a hot dog, sausage, or polish... And now the reality: This place has gotten just WAY (and I do mean ""WAY"") too trendy. I miss the old days (about two Summers ago) when this place wasn't as nearly as crowded as it is now. Back then you could walk in on a weekday and they're would only be a few people would be in line in front of you, if that. Saturdays were always a bit crowded, but it's just seriously out of hand now. I go by there on Saturday afternoons and see that the lines just go around the f*cking block....what is this? A restaurant or a nightclub? Even though I'm less than a mile from here, I just can't rationalize spending 45 + minutes to stand in a line for what basically is a Hot Dog (and some of them are getting obscenly over priced as they creep towards the $10 price) - I don't care what kind of gourmet meat and or fusion-infused topping is being used. The food here is really good, but again, I can't justify waiting in line so long only to sit down and be hustled out quickly so someone else can eat at my table... This place needs to move into a bigger space before I can justify returning here."
1247,"What can I say that hasn't been said? Having frequented Hot Doug's for six out of the seven years it's been in business, I've watched it grow from quirky little Roscoe Village hot dog stand to nationwide sensation. After all the press (Check Please, Gourmet magazine, the New York Times, the Tribune, LTHForum) the lines have gotten longer but nothing's changed. Doug is still the same lovable wiseguy he always was, the prices have stayed super-reasonable, and almost every sausage combination offered is still a home run (I'm particularly partial to the ribeye steak sausage with chimichurri sauce and crispy fried onions, and the Teuben, a corned-beef sausage with sauerkraut and Russian dressing). Doug's is the only eating place in the city, if not the entire country, for which I can justify standing in line for 45 minutes on a weekend afternoon (unlike several well-known Lincoln Park/Lakeview brunch spots, whose popularity I find absolutely incomprehensible). Once inside, the place is a well-oiled machine; somehow there is never, ever a wait for a table once you've placed your order. Soon after its inception, Doug's quickly became a Saturday-afternoon tradition for me and my friends (and thousands of others, I know). If you live in Chicago, you're probably thinking about eating there right now. If you have lived in Chicago, or you've spent any time here in the past six years, you've probably contemplated flying back just to eat here. I even know a few people who have attempted to do it on a really tight layover at O'Hare or Midway."
1248,"I would give Hot Doug's five stars for sure for being the only place in this city that not only has great veggie hotdogs but veggie corndogs as well. I'd even give six because everyone that works there, including Doug, seems so damn nice and on top of things. Unfortunately, the wait is so prohibitively long and just infuriating that there is no way I can continue to promote it. It literally makes me furious to see a line that long, and I give everyone the bird when I drive by. I am officially boycotting Hot Doug's."
1249,"I can't believe I waited for an hour and a half at a hot dog place. And guess what? I'll do it again. Maybe if you're lucky, an ice cream truck will come along while you're waiting, too! Yes, bring cash (which reminds me, I need to send Dave a check) and check their hours and specials online before you come."
1250,"The wait was two hours long, was it worth it? Yes! Would I do it again? Not for two hours! I had the Chicago style, Andouille sausage with brown mustard and sauteed onions (Salma Hayek), Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Caribbean Dijonnaise and Sauteed Plantains, and the Smoked Alligator Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and St. Pete's Blue Cheese. The Chicago dog: best I've ever had; in fact so good I would put it up in the same caliber of tastiness as their with his 'gourmet' and exotic dogs Andouille: simple, tasty, elegant; solid solid choice Alligator: Didn't taste like chicken...didn't taste like what I thought alligator would taste like either..supposedly it tastes like fish/rabbit; it was hard to get a good taste with the blue cheese. Blue cheese usually overpowers anything its on unless its used very sparingly Jerk pork: really damn good. Perfect embodiment of Doug's...simple, yet refined; and really damn tasty. The meat encased wasn't completely ground. It was actually quite chunky, which I prefer; it gives you more of the feeling of consuming real meat. The dijonnaise was a well matched complement to the sausage. Duck fat fries: Kinda dissapointing. I know they are cut on the premises, but they are much too thin; and they dont' retain heat very well. They seemed to be warm at best. Perhaps a sizzling hot batch would be really good. But even after eating them immediately after being served (while only warm); they tasted just like plain ol' fries. PS Although the classic Chicago dog is a steal at $1.75, the more eclectic and exotic choices can go any where from $7-11 Overall: Tasty, quirky and fun. Just come on a deader day. And bring a book, umbrella, and maybe a granola bar. Go with 2-3 friends, it'll help the time go by faster in line; plus its all about variety here. Just order up a ton and share them. They cut quite well."
1251,"I am a girl that loves her sausages... brats, polish, Italian, hot dogs, and pretty much any other kind of sausage that have graced my lips. So, why in the hell did it take me 3 years to get to Hot Dougs?! I decided to come here for the first time today with my friend that was visiting from Minneapolis. I thought that it would be a great place to go seeing there is pretty much nothing like it anywhere else and HDs definitely did not disappoint. We got to HDs around 10:45 or so and the line was down the street and took about a 1/2 hour before we were able to place our order. No worries there because what we had before us was totally worth the wait. My friend had the burgundy and citrus pork with sun-dried tomato mustard and peppercorn cheese and he just could not stop raving about his sausage! I had the mushroom and Swiss cheese pork sausage with chili-garlic mustard, shitake mushrooms, and baby Edam cheese... yummy! We both had the order of duck fries too because, after all, it was Friday! I was almost going to give them 4 stars because, eh, the wait honestly sucks but the extra star goes for the music! Anyplace that is playing Orgasm Addict by the Buzzcocks while I am eating a sausage earns those 5 stars!"
1252,"This is where I go to train in my hot-dog speed eating. Here's why: All their hot dogs are more akin to sausages rather than the soft things you get from Vienna Beef. The casing is gamier so it's chewy and the meat is spiced up much more than your average dog. The other sausages are fantastic for training too. Of course, if you're not an aspiring competitive eater, this stuff is great too. The duck fat fries are awesome. I can definitely tell the difference the same way I can tell the difference between Coke/Pepsi. It's a textural difference of crispiness and you can taste the duck like the way you can taste bacon in a carbonara sauce. It helps if you don't eat fries with ketchup or know the taste of duck very well. If you're a ketchup using non-duck eater, don't bother because you probably won't notice the difference. And while I appreciate the complimentary cheese and sauces for their more exotic sausages, might I suggest getting them plain? I find the cheese and sauces to be delicious but overpowering for some of the better sausages. (Digression: I'll never understand Chicagoans and their aversion to ketchup because when you add emerald relish, hot pepper, tomato, celery salt, mustard, onions, and pickle; you are essentially eating a hot-dog flavored salad and the addition of ketchup will barely perverse the flavor of a good dog. If the flavor of the meat is crucial, eat it plain. And if ketchup ruins the flavor so much, why would you add it to everything else but hot dogs? Message me if you care to discuss the finer points of hot dogs and ketchup.) So many places will tell you about how awesome their hot dog is, but if it's a boiled Vienna Beef, what is the difference really? Is it so good you could eat it plain and love it? That's why I love Hot Doug's. The food impresses without being dressed up."
1253,"Talk about a sausage fest! If I could give this joint 15 stars, I would. After waiting for 45 minutes outside on a blustery February day, we waited another 15 minutes inside the cramped storefront. And, trust me, there were no complaints from me. Heck, I would've waited another half hour at least to taste the pork sausage with pear creme fraiche, toasted almonds and Gorgonzola cheese again. I actually have dreams about that life-changing encased meat. So my good friend Jake was in town from Indy. And he's one of those people who usually eat dogs with 'ketchup only.' After all of my pontificating about the wonder of Chicago dogs, he finally agreed to try one. And I thought, what better place than Hot Dougs? Well, call me a matchmaker, because it was love at first bite. He's hooked. Mr. Ketchup Only is now singing the praises of everything that is a Chicago dog. Sans the ketchup, of course. Hot Dougs couldn't have been better. And with all the hype surrounding this little place, my only letdown were the duck fat fries. Maybe I was paying too much attention to my main entree, but they didn't really do it for me. Ah well, next time I'll skip the fries and order another dog."
1254,"This may be the only time I've ever written this in my life: Worth the wait. Since I'm not the subject of this review, I'm not gonna go on about how impatient I am or how I hate to wait. But, allow an extra hour (half?) for lunch here on the weekend. To the Doug's. Delicious! EXACTLY what I want- great food, fun place, and amazing food. The food was really good too. In fact- if I could have my 'would rathers', I would eat at places like this all the time, it kind of ruined my last few weeks of dining out, quite frankly - to sit down in shorts and a tshirt, not deal with shitty service, pretentious staff, or over-written menus and just have GREAT FOOD is SO refreshing! Incredible flavors, amazing presentation (who doesn't love a sausage on a bun in a plastic basket), and basically incredible all around. I tried 4 sausages and I'm not gonna list them, but I didn't have a single thing that I wasn't CRAZY about. Cheers to you, Mr. Sausage man."
1255,There have been so many reviews it will be hard to add any thing useful! But I just have to share my love for Hot Dougs... it would be so wrong not to. One thing I can share is that I am not a meat eater (well besides all those delicious sea creatures) but I swear I crave a trip to Hot Doug's for veggie dogs almost as often as my boyfriend starts feigning for their many varieties of sausage. It is just that tempting. So try it out.. don't be scared of the line.. it is worth it!
1256,"I emailed Hot Doug once to inquire about the day's specials, and he signed his reply ""Sausagely, Doug."" So I basically loved this place before I even got there. You have to go on Friday or Saturday for the duck fat fries, and keep in mind it closes kind of early, at 4pm. You can smell the fries before you even open the car door, and you gotta get used to it because the wait is usually at least 20 minutes. The specials menu changes daily. One time, they had Ale & Chipotle Buffalo sausage with Hard Cider mustard and Monterey-Jack cheese, Mediterranean Lamb Sausage with Red-Curry Garlic sauce and Feta cheese, and White Wine and Dijon Rabbit sausage with Truffle sauce Moutarde and Port Salut cheese. On my first visit, I didn't know the cash-only policy and nearly broke into tears thinking I couldn't afford the fries AND a sausage. Doug himself quickly wrote both items down on my order sheet, saying he couldn't have anyone looking that sad in his store. He cheerily took what money we could give him and told us to get some drinks and find a seat, never once expressing irritation with us. The order was out in a few short minutes, and the waittress was happy to dump an obscenely large order of the fries on our table. They didn't look like anything impressive but as soon as I popped one of the skinny delights, totally condiment-free, I was overcome by a flavor never this apparent in regular fries. They weren't the super-crispy texture I usually look for, but it didn't matter. They were dashed with grains of sea salt visible to the naked eye, a perfect complement to the smokey, earthy flavor. It was tough to halt my frenzied shoveling action with the fries, but my Apple and Cherry Pork sausage awaited, with Sweet Dijon mustard and Blue cheese, all drizzled with honey and topped with Griottes (tiny canned sour cherries). On another visit, I was slightly disappointed by the Reuben-themed corned beef sausage, topped with Russian dressing, Swiss cheese and saurkraut, but I think that's just because I'm not too fond of Russian dressing, and there was a lot of it. The fries alone are worth the wait, but this is one place I feel like I can order pretty much any specialty dog and walk away with a smile on my face."
1257,"Who gave this one star? Maybe they waited too long. It doesn't matter though. I went today at around one and really only waited fifteen minutes. I got a Fire Dog (which I refuse to call Kiera Knightly, because I don't think she's hot) and the game of the week: three chili wild boar sausage with chipotle dijonnaise and smoked gouda. And it was delicious. I tried to the foie gras and duck sausage, which was also delicious. As it was my first time getting boar, I was nervous (which I shouldn't have been because I love meat) but when I ordered, Doug was very excited that I did and said ""Good, because it's really delicious."" And that's when I knew that I had made the right decision. The fire dog was delicious too; the fact that you can hear the casing snap is awesome. I love it for sure. I don't think there really can be anything else to be said. I'm sure you've been told to go. So go. If you don't like waiting in line, forego the weekend and skip the duck fat fries. Go at the off times. Just do it. It's delicious and well worth it."
1258,"After hearing many raves about this hot dog wonderland - I finally had a Saturday afternoon to kill on this venture. As expected the wait was over an hour, the owner was very personable and the food was exceptional. I ordered a Thai Chicken Dog with peanut sauce and coconuts. I couldn't have dreamed up a better hot dog to suit my taste buds! My roommate ordered the Gyro dog with olive paste and feta - which also suited her to a T. Doug knows exactly what we want better than we do! He's in our heads! The fries in duck fat and cheese were also out of this world. Now that I've been to Hot Doug's once, here are my expert tips on making your next hot dog venture a great one: 1. Have a light snack before making the trip. The long wait mixed with the delicious smells might make you crazy. 2. Bring entertainment for the line. I.e. friends to chat with, a book, a street performer, etc. 3. If you get thirsty, there's a convenience store close by for a quick water run. 4. When you finally get to the register - don't order something boring. Go wild! And buy lots of it! You waited in line forever - leave satisfied."
1259,"Uhhhhh, what's better than cylinders of meat that you can put in your mouth? This place is cool, it's decorated like a corner joint in a neighborhood that's a little less affluent than the one it currently occupies, but there's nothing phony about Hot Doug's phlavor! I've never made it for the duck fat fries, but I've heard from reputable sources (chunky monkeys) that they're delish. As for the line around the block and the limited hours: Suck it up and quit being a cry baby. And who wants to eat a dog before 11am or after 4pm anyway. It's lunch food. If you want late night hot dogs go somewhere with night life. If you want a tasty nd reasonably priced (though greasy) lunch, go to Hot Doug's!"
1260,"Having heard legends about a hot dog served with foie gras, I went out of my way to stop at Hot Doug's on my way traveling from San Francisco to South Bend to watch my beloved Fighting Irish, and it was worth every minute of CTA discomfort. I ordered both The Dog (standard Chicago-style dog) and the Foie Gras/Duck Sauterne sausage because I'd been so long away from Chicago. BIG MISTAKE. The Foie Gras/Duck Sauterne is an extremely rich sausage, and it was very difficult to keep down after having already devoured a hot dog plus half an order of fries (regular, not duck fat. I'm not a complete idiot). The rich, juicy sausage and its foie gras mousse accompaniment melted into beautiful mess in my mouth that literally made me groan inappropriately with pleasure. Given a choice between sex and that meal, I think the meal would win 6/10 times. I also don't care how gay that sounds. Given the fat and salt content, I'm glad I ordered Coke instead of my usual water. Remember, oil and water don't mix! The place is a little off the public transport path, and it is CASH ONLY, so be prepared. Also, the line is long, so be prepared to spit out your order when you get to the cashier. Unless you need a braille menu or a translator, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to make up your mind by the time the friendly proprietors ask you, ""Welcome to Hot Doug's, what would you like today?"" And yes, that guy taking your order is Doug himself."
1261,"Chicagoland weather today, 45 degrees with a bit of a wind chill, 30% chance of rain. (In ANY other town or state, we call it a storm, or perhaps a tornado!) I get off of my 4 hour flight from San Jose, jump in the car, and off to Doug's ... time is ticking! We drive by and see a LINE WRAPPED AROUND THE BUILDING! Oh yeah, for some mysterious reason when I see a line, my sub conscience tells me I need to wait in it. ""Dad, stop the car, I need to get in that God awful line!"" Perhaps I do it because I hear nothing but good things about this place, perhaps it's the fact that I haven't eaten anything since 5:00 that morning, or simply because I don't want to hear my dad talking anymore, and me standing in that line will ensure that quiet time. I practically jump out of the car while it's still moving. Here's my conversation in that line; Me -""Have you been here before?"" Red-haired girl, ""Yes."" Me -""Um, is the line always this long?"" Red-haired girl, ""Yes, so I try to get here right when they open at 11:00"" So this is NORMAL, so get used to that line, and make sure you check the weather report before you go! So worth it! ONE HOUR AND TWENTY-TWO MINUTES later, I see Doug! I feel like I need to have a baby for him to kiss, or for him to sign something, like an autographed picture or my chest with a Sharpie marker. I place my order, the Chicago dog, the Selma Hayek, Duck Fat Fries and the *Game of the Week* which was Buffalo Sausage with smoked gouda cheese and chipotle dijionaise. I am out of my mind with delight at this point, and I can't tell if it's because I'm ready to eat my own arm or that I'm finally out of the cold. Either way, I am the happiest person on the planet. I am rubbernecking the patrons taking pictures of their food, Doug, and the store, and feel like I'm in a bizarre movie. So I join in and snap photos as if I've never left home before. Hello? These are the BEST dogs EVER! So worth it! Hey Doug, are you single? I want to be your Hot Dog slave! (Oh wait, I think I am your slave already!)"
1262,"We went to Hot Doug's this summer on a Friday, because they only make their famous duck fat fries on Friday and Saturday. Also wanted to try the foie gras dog that got him in trouble during our year-long FG ban in Chicago. Good thing it was summer as we waited in a line of maybe 60 people out the door and around the block. Waited so long I went and sat in our car for the last 1/2 hour, reading the newspaper, let my spouse keep our spot. Finally got in the door one hour and 45 minutes later to find out we were ""lucky""--it was 3:55pm and the line closes off at 4pm and then the resto itself closes as soon as the last of us are gone...and there were only 3 people behind us who made the cut. Imagine waiting 1 hour and 40 minutes and then being told you couldn't get in... Once inside, a lengthy menu of the most bizarre hot dog combos you can imagine. Spouse ordered the famous foie gras and Sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris for $9. Ugh. I mean, I love buttery cheesey things but this was sooooo over-the-top. Mine was worse. I had the Saucisson Alsacienne, which was bacon sausage with creme fraiche, caramelized onions and Camembert cheese for $8. It had a 3-inch thick slab of half-melted low-quality cheese on top. Camembert does not go with hot dogs, believe me. And the dogs themselves were puny, so the condiments are necessary to make you feel you actually ate something substantial. The famous duck fat fries were totally boring and mundane, no better than ordinary fries, with some icky peel left on (I'm a purist, no peel on my french fries, please, just shows you're too lazy to peel). Mickey D's fries are an order of magnitude better, certainly Gene and Jude's. I cook with duck fat a lot (it's wonderfully tasty and actually a ""good"" fat), and it's great for roasting potatoes or veggies. So I know what duck fat potatoes should taste like. These tasted like cardboard. It was 5pm and a couple of double sawbucks before we got out of there, and we had left the house around 2pm. A lovely last touch: the staff was putting chairs on top of the tables and mopping the floor all around us with smelly stuff while we were finishing. Desite the added fragrance, the high-fat, high-grease, high-cheese pall hung over us for days. But based on prior reviews (which is why we finally went there), it appears that many people would die to get in there and eat, maybe will die after. Doug himself is a wise guy but doesn't have the routine down right. He's not deli wise-guy, or Ina wise-gal, or Charlie Socher wise-chef, but kind of mean and not funny. He barks at people and takes cash only, sits up front at the podium counting his cash while you wait in line. Laughing all the way to the bank..."
1263,"You've got a billion reviews that state how good this place is. You've got a changing menu based on Doug's preferences. You've got encased meats that are wild game, that you may never had the opportunity to try elsewhere, done up gourmet style. You've got affordable and high end... the simple Chicago dog all the way to foie gras. You've got Doug, possibly the most involved and friendliest restaurant owner I know who makes it point to greet every customer coming in. And the wait for a table is deceptive... people are in and out much faster than you think. Hang around and take in the decor! Just go! What more convincing do you need? Highly recommended."
1264,"I probably ate like a sumo wrestler after a match after waiting in line for 1.5 hours. Between the 3 of us, we ordered 5 sausages and 2 baskets of duck fat rendered fries. Umm.... AMAZING. I heart fries and I heart duck fat rendered fries more. We need more meat that taste like duck and not like chicken. Given that this place only makes sausages, I feel like they could've done better with the chicken sausage. It was chewy and dry."
1265,"Anyone who doesn't give this place 5 stars is unAmerican. Seriously though, it's not an hour wait any day, every day because their food is just mediocre, it's because it's the best hot dog you might ever wrap your lips around."
1266,Found this place on Yelp while visiting Chicago for Lollapalooza. Had to travel forever and a half to get there and then wait in line for about another hour to get in.... ....but it is definitely good! I'm big on uniqueness (as evident by my previous reviews) and this place is no exception. Where else can you get a Guiness soaked sausage topped with goodness? How about Ostrich? Check Duck? Check. Jamaican Jerky? Check. The wait was worth it and I think this is a must for everyone visiting Chicago. Whoever said don't get the Duck Fat Fries is on something! These are awesome!
1267,A+++++ would do business again.
1268,"Reason #1 you should skip the overcrowded Elston Target(bleh), and go to Addison Mall for a Target fix: You're an extremely short drive or walk away from Hot Doug's goodness, and even better if you do it on a weekday! After going on a Saturday this past summer, I can honestly say I never will do that again. The thought of going here suddenly came when I was helping my mom shop at the Addison Mall Tar-ghey, and I'm so glad it occurred in my mind right as I was leaving there. My new favorite sausage by far is their Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, the thought of how amazing it was almost makes me want to go there right this second. I tried my mom's Polish, and it interestingly was the first time I'd ever gotten one of their basic meats(traditionally sticking to the gourmet sausages). Finally, I will second Julia's comment about how great of an idea it is to program HD's number into your cell phone. I've done it, and making either a call to that(or checking the website beforehand) will save you accidental trips when Doug takes a break(err, vacation) from serving gourmet sausages, and(obviously) call your order in."
1269,"Who would of thought encased meat in a bun can get so exotic and intricate?!! Try everything, don't ask to exclude condiments or add condiments that they don't normally put on the dogs, and come HUNGRY. You'll want to try half the menu. Fridays and Saturdays are the best time to come for duck fat fries but also the worse because of the wait."
1270,"I like to think that Doug and I are friends, because he went to Kendall, and I . . . dropped out of Kendall a semester before graduating. But I digress. Even though Doug and I have never been introduced, every time I get to the front of the line he acts like he's really psyched to see me. But he acts like that for all the girls. . . and guys. . . and kids. . . and that's a big part of what makes Hot Doug's so fantastic-- the fact that the owner always seems like there's nowhere else he'd rather be. He's the ultimate host of the best party in town- the best sausage party! Aw yeah! But seriously folks, this is some tasty food here. Though I will admit, In the 4 or 5 times I've been there, I've always gotten the same thing- chicken Italian sausage with all the fixin's. As a self-proclaimed 'almost vegetarian,' Hot Doug's is the only place I've found where I can actually get a Chicago-style hot dog! Add some duck-fat fries, a veggie corn dog and some root beer, and this girl is about as happy as she can be. I do like to read the specials board, even though I've never ordered off of it, and I gotta tell you, some of those combos make me want to go full carnivore. But alas. . . The line is always huge, I'm not gonna lie. Best to plan ahead, and not show up when you're already starving. The line moves pretty quickly, but I have waited up to an hour (believe me, it's worth it). It's a bit out of the way, but doesn't that make it all the more special? UPDATE: Since writing this review I have officially jumped back on the meat train. I'm more into pork than beef, but I am known to dabble. Yesterday I jumped in head first. Yesterday, I had my first Tueben. Picture a Rueben sqeezed into a tube, and you pretty much get it. Amazing. I'm not a big sauerkraut fan, but this stuff was sweet and tangy and delicious. And while I am struggling to consume this beefy overload, lo and behold, I found. . . a second sausage in my bun. THERE ARE TWO SAUSAGES IN THERE. And faster than you could say 'that's what she said,' I found myself struggling to determine how I could finish that much meat (I couldn't). But it was worth the effort."
1271,"This place would be even better if only locals could frequent it. :-) I kid, I kid. It's pretty rare to find a place that serves chicken dogs -- at least in Chicago anyway. For that, this place deserves 5 stars since chicken is a mainstay of my diet. I honestly could not distinguish the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries. For the added heart disease risk, I'd expect these fries to be phenomenal. That aside, the place is pretty kitschy and has a fun, retro vibe. The man I assume to be Doug (who takes your order) is always friendly and never rushes you while you place your order. What would make it even better would be if it were open on Sundays. The line on Saturdays can make it a bit of a challenge to pop in and grab a bite."
1272,"There is very little to add to the reviews here. Hot Doug's is an awesome place to go try some crazy new (or regular) sausage dog for lunch...with duck fat fries as an option on Fridays and Saturdays. The line-ups go well out the door at lunch time, so while they manage to move everyone through quite well, don't be in a huge rush here. Doug is generally there, taking orders and being highly personable. His applying gourmet standards to hot dogs and sausages has been a huge hit, and I'm sure it will continue to remain a Chicago destination for years to come."
1273,"I'm just going to echo what 900 other reviews have already said. Hot Doug's actually lives up to all the hype. 1) Got there right when they opened on Saturday AM and I didn't expect a 40 min wait, mostly outside in the rain and cold. I kept asking myself, ""Who [else] eats hot dogs at 10:30AM?!"" And then I realized that these were my kind of people, in my kind of town. God I love hot dogs. 2) Hot Doug's excels at both the bread and butter dog and the gourmet. Best Chicago Dog ever! Had mine deep-fried (!!!) and it had perfect snap with fresh, high-quality toppings. The wild boar sausage was fantastically tender and well-paired with the smoked gouda 3) If possible, avoid sitting at the counter facing cold, starving patrons waiting in line. It made me feel truly gluttonous to be inhaling my duck fries and multiple hot dogs with people literally going hungry right before my eyes."
1274,"I had to wait more than an hour to eat at this place, but it was so worth it! I had the mountaineer here which was the game of the week. It considered of a bunch of meat like elk, venison, antelope. And it was really good, but as good as that was, my favorite is the foie gras hot dog made with duck sausage and truffle aioli. SOOOO GOOOD!!! It tastes fatty but you have to try it at least once! Also ordered duck fat fries which were also good. It was a lot of food. Fries come in a large portion."
1275,"The kitsch decor, self-depricating owner and fabulously inventive sausage makes this the hands down best hotdog stand known to western civilization. Doug, looking every bit Elvis Costello's long lost brother, throws himself amongst the hoi palloi, working the counter with gusto and providing some excellent customer service. Last weekend I snacked on elk sausage with mustard and sage derby, the time before alligator, and before that buffalo... and just to keep it real I always get a corndog - for $1.50 I just can't bear to turn one down (they even offer a vegetarian corndog option which is nearly as good for the non-carnivores out there). We had a side by side taste test of the regular fries and duck fat fries, and while both good the duck fat fry is worth a couple extra bucks (hey - if mcdonald's made their fries in beef tallow for years, how much can a little duck fat hurt ya?) I've had to wait over an hour to get my order in before, and if I didn't have to wait I'd probably be pissed - pissed that everyone else was stupid and missing out. For my money, the wait just increases the expectancy, and helps you savor the sausage all the more. Just think of it as waiting in line for a roller coaster - a 30 minute wait for a couple minute thrill. Ah... but what a thrill it is."
1276,"I was in town visiting friends and family and one of my foodie buddies took me to Hot Doug's. There are enough reviews, so I'll make this brief... We waited 45 mintues just to order and it was entirely worth it. I'm not a big ""crowds"" person, but we had a choice of seats after we ordered. The food truly is amazing. The owner was there taking our order and couldn't have been a happier guy. Fridays and Saturdays are best so you can try the duck fat fries. If you've never been, you need to go. Seriously. Stop reading this. Go. Now."
1277,"What the hell have I been doing prior to Hot Doug's! Why have I been dealing with the run of the mill steamed Vienna for all of these years?? I have seen the light and what a bright man Doug is. For the first time this afternoon, I ventured over to Hot Dougs. It was about quarter to 3, so the line wasn't too long. I must have waited behind about 6 people, but that gave me the opportunity to check out the rad menu. Did I say rad menu? Yah...it was pretty rad. I had the Elvis, which was a Polish Sausage ""Smoked and Savory-just like the King"" with the works on it -mustard, relish, pickles, onions, tomatoes and celery salt...Chicago style just how I like it. The sausage itself was a finer grind than a regular Polish that you would come across, but it was smokey with the perfect blend of spices. I ordered mine charred which is not easy to come by. I burn the crap out of my dogs out on the grill in the summer, so to be able to get a charred dog in the winter time was more than pleasant. I ordered the a small fry with my dog and fell in love. Normally, I like super crispy crunchy skinny fries, but Doug's were awesome. They are a little thicker and fresh cut with the skins on. They completely tickled my fancy. I went pretty simple this time, but they have a great selections of flavors and different game dogs that I will try in the near future. I am a huge fan of game meats and I am all over that wild boar and apple sausage with cranberry cheddar cheese next time. They have veggie dogs for the veggies out there, chicken dogs for those not so into beef, corn dogs for the little ones and good old beef dogs for the rest of you. Doug blends and packs his own sausages and that makes me happy. As for the decor, blue, red, and yellow come to mind. They have kitchy posters about hotdogs and chicks all over the walls and The King is king here. Elvis is everywhere. Hot Doug's is a good old Chicago hot dog joint on steriods and I feel is a great addition to the traditional Chicago dog...I mean Doug."
1278,"Fast, friendly, flavorful. Good. Long lines, crowded inside. Bad. Factor in the duck sausage, and the good definitely outweighs the bad."
1279,"Came here for a late lunch ( ""late"" because of the wait) ... here are my thoughts: 1. Relatively easy parking on street 2. 1 hr wait 3. CASH ONLY 4. Regular hot dogs are cheap $2 - $4 (def worth it) 5. Specialty hot dogs are almost $10 (only worth it if you pick the right ones) 6. Duck fat fries - good but did not live up to the hype. HUGE ORDER and only available on Fridays and Saturdays. 7. Free refills - the bf and I got a small coke and shared it in order to use all the cash we had on hotdogs.. haha We ordered a total of 6 hotdogs and duck fat fries for the 2 of us. We are very hungry people and we thought we better try as much as we can, since we waited in line for that long. Here is the line up (in order of deliciousness) : 1. The Frankie ""Five Angels"" - italian sausage - AMAZING. SO SOFT AND FLAVORFUL. This would be the reason I come back. 2. The Keira Knightley - spicy goodness - this sausage used to be named Britney Spears. haha, guess she's not hot anymore. 3. The Marty Allen - pork and garlic hot dog - nothing special 4. The Elvis - a Polish - the BF liked it but it was only ok for me. 5. The Dave Kingman - Santa Fe style by recommendation - it was only ok 6. Our special hotdog was one with cottage cheese on top? - it was my least favorite and wished i spent the money on two more regular hot dogs instead. But I have to give Hot Doug's props for having so many unique hot dogs. Overall, we left happy and full. Great friendly service. Everyone in line around us were all first timers, just like us. I wonder if they get a lot of returning customers.. I mean, it's worth the wait if it's your first time, but I wouldn't come back unless I'm with out-of-town friends visiting Chicago."
1280,"I need to make a list of ""Places that do one thing and do it well."" Hot Doug's would be the apex of that list. If I ever get hitched, Doug will cater my wedding and instead of eating bone dry chicken cordon bleu and stringy beef my guests will consecrate my union at the temple of savory encased meats. My favorites are the Loukaniko (greek-style sausage with tzitziki and crumbled feta) and the Ribeye (with crispy onions and horseradish or chimichurri) but you can't go wrong here. Whether you want to spend a couple $ on a perfectly grilled red hot or spring for one of the gourmet links of the day (listed on their website), you will leave happy. Go during the week for lunch if you want to beat the long lines, and drop a buck in the tip jar for goodness' sake. Were you raised in a barn?"
1281,"Line or no line, I still love Hot Doug's. This is the first stop I drag any of my out of town guests. I still can't believe how creative someone can get with a sausage. I brought Doug some hot dog paraphernalia to put his hot dog shrine. It was a really bonding moment. I worry that I spend too much time thinking about about Hot Doug. My companion scolded me for being obsessed over him. I just can't help it. Here are a few questions that I often ask myself... What does Hot Doug like to do in his spare time? What are his favorite TV shows? Where does he like to go to get some tasty eats? How in the heck does he come up with these concoctions? What is his favorite season? Does he have any pets? Perhaps a hot dog dog? What is his favorite style of swimming? Will Hot Doug be my friend? If so does he want to come over to Humboldt Park and play badminton? Ugh, what is wrong with me? I am so weird and I have way too much time on my hands."
1282,"I don't think i'm giong to say anything that hasn't already been said in 700 reviews...This is probably the best possible Hot Dog preparation and specialty versions...In the world. If you want the best competitor in NYC, go to Crif Dog's in the East Village. They don't have the same level of Gourmet Stuff that Doug has, but it will definitely be tasty. The one thing that bums me out about this place are the specialty dogs being $7-8, if they were $5-6, i would understand, but $8!!? C'mon Doug, i know you probably deserve it, but we all don't have that kind of cash on a daily/weekly basis... :-(."
1283,"What more can I say that hasn't been said already about Hot Doug's? See the wonders of encased meat at the website (http://www.hotdougs.com). Under the daily specials you'll find a selection approximately around 8 different kinds of exotic blends and game meat. They change up the menu throughout the week, so check it out before going in. I always get a special, but if your funds are low the dogs, bratwurst and traditional sausages are also available. Everyone seems to mention the Duck Fat Fries so you might as well see what all the fuss is about (only on Fridays and Saturdays). The hours are from 10:30 --- 4 Monday through Saturday, but I would suggest avoiding the lunch rush from 12 --- 2. The line will literally wrap around the exterior of the building. Doug must be swimming in a pile of money Strooge McDuck style, because they frequently close down the store for vacation time. Again, make sure to check the website for holiday closings. Lastly, I should mention that Doug and his staff are incredibly welcoming people. If you go there enough Doug might even remember your name. This place is top notch and I hope it never leaves us again, like it did temporarily after its old location was closed due to problems with the building. Bon appetite!"
1284,"This place is worth the special trip. On a Thursday afternoon around 4pm, we waited in line about 45 minutes. I recommend checking their website for daily specials. I had gone for the foie gras dog, but it wasn't on that day. Also, Duck fat fries are Friday and Saturday only. Doug is an awesome guy. I'd wait in line just to have him take my order any day! He even bought us drinks because we said we were in Chicago just to go to Alinea (and drop about a grand on dinner). A must stop when in Chicago!"
1285,"Hot Doug's is everything a local eatery should be. Great food, friendly service, and a quirky, fun atmosphere. The wait will be long. There's pretty much no getting around that. But it's a product of a place that refuses to expand or change and lose what makes it great. And trust me, the food is worth it. Don't expect much in the way of your standard hot dog. These are specialty dogs that will completely change the way you view encased meats."
1286,"I love it! I'm not a fan of hot dogs but since coming to the city known for their hot dogs, I had to go! Also prior to booking my ticket, I saw them featured on the food network channel so it was a must go to!! The first day I went here, I got the kira knightly, my boyfriend and Aileen V go the Selma Hayak, and my mom got the Elvis Presly. I thought it was pretty good but not as spicy as I imagined it to be though. We also got a side of fries which were pretty good, and for all you people out there who know about in n' out, it's like that. My boyfriend loved it so much that he went back for seconds and got the italian sausage which was also really good! The second time I went here, I got the lamb sausage with the sweet curry mustard and the smoked gouda. This did it for me. I loved it! I even wanted another one, it was THAT good. I also had to get the duck fat fries which I was a bit disappointed but it was still good, I just didn't taste any duck to it, it was more like in n' out well done fries for me. My boyfriend got the paul kelly which was also pretty yummy! We also got the cheese fries! It was so crazy! I recommend getting here early! The first day we went here we got lucky and we ended up being the first ones in line. Then the 2nd day, we were there for about 30 minutes and the line already went out the door!"
1287,"There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats', my friend. Thus sayeth the motto of Hot Doug's - nay, their very raison d'etre. Everything about Doug's is delightful, from the Wiener-on-a-Stick decor colors (bright primaries) to the names of the menu items (sausages are named after celebs, which change due to relevance - the Andouille sausage (""Mighty, mighty, mighty hot"") is now the Salma Hayek but used to be the Ann-Margret). Being Chicagoan to my core, soul food to me is a Chicago-style dog and fresh-cut cheese fries. Looking around Doug's, I'm not alone. The place is almost *always* packed. Not open for dinner, and if you're unlucky enough to get a craving during the lunch rush, be prepared to wait. The line often wraps around the corner and up the block. It is so, so worth it. Hand-made gourmet fast food? Oh my God, yes please. One of the best Chicago dogs I've ever had, say nothing for daily specials like sun-dried tomato chicken sausage with fresh basil and mozzarella. You'll be surprised at the versatility of encased meats on this menu. Sausage aficianados will rejoice. Vegetarians will rejoice (when I was a vegetarian, Doug's veggie dog kept me very, very happy.) They even have corn dogs (which also come in veggie) that I mean to try every time I go in but usually get distracted from. The fries are hearty, crisp, and wonderful. The cheese sauce somehow avoids tasting fakey and processed (although it might well be... I don't know, honestly.) When I sit down with my tray full of goodies at Doug's (if I can find a table), I am at peace. My Dad opened a business not long ago closeby, and he started raving about the food. I've been going with friends since high school, so we talk about it together. My Mom is jealous that neither of us have taken her yet, so we'll certainly have to do that. Some things you should know: * The (expansive) daily menu isn't at all overpriced, but the daily specials are not cheap. They are, however, hand-made gourmet delicacies and they are huge, often with exotic or expensive ingredients. * There is an over-abundance of street parking. No porblem. * You're going to either want to call or check the website before you head over to Hot Doug's, because they like to close for a few days for silly reasons. Back from college for break, a friend and I were very disappointed when we got to Doug's (no line outside... bad sign) only to find them closed for three days in celebration of Don Knotts' birthday. Lesson learned. * And last but most important, Doug already likes you. He loves his business, he loves his food, and he loves his customers. When things get crazy, many business owners will check out and leave an employee or manager to deal with the havoc. But most of the time, it's Doug taking orders and dishing out change at the counter during the lunch rush when the line of hungry sausage-lovers is up the block and growing. And he's happy to see you!"
1288,"Not much I can add here, except a couple of observations. One from a friend from New York who now lives here. She cannot believe that people line up as they do here and that they act so civil towards one another. I had told her about barging through a line of about 50 people there one day to deliver something to Caliente Doug. She claims in New York I probably would have been attacked or otherwise maimed for that, and that people in line would not be so civil if they were New Yorkers. I hadn't thought of that angle. Even after living and working in New York. My observation about the lines is that I cannot believe that people wait OUTSIDE in 20-degree weather to get in here. I love it dearly, but can guarantee that I would never do that. Back in Oz, where I come from, no-one waits in any lines for anything or anyone. Not cubs, not Apple stores, not rock concerts, nada! Well, maybe if it's just out the door, I would...but not halfway down the block. I am thinking, too, that during our current ""economic downturn"", foreigners, out-of-towners, and other innocents who drive by Doug's must think it's a Depression bread line, a soup kitchen, or an unemployment office. My other observation is that I am both surprised and impressed by the fact that with all of the hoo-ha and fame surrounding the place, it is still humble Doug who sits there everyday, greets you, and takes your order. I think if I had his culinary success, I would delegate that task. I have to admire him for that."
1289,"Just do it, dude. It's worth the wait, burning hot or freezing cold."
1290,"There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats', my friend. If I were a woman, I'd have been hatching a scheme to marry Doug a long time ago. That's how good this place is. I just went here today, in fact, for about the 50th time. It is so good, it's sinful. I don't care if I have to wait 45 minutes to get in while standing in the cold, hungover. This place has been featured on numerous cooking shows (national), New York times, other national daily papers. IT IS JUST THAT GOOD! Today I tried the Mint and Garlic Lamb Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper Mayonnaise and Pinna Brigante Sheep's Milk Cheese. Quite a mouthful. It was delicious, as always. And the DUCK FAT FRIES. Unbelievable and you get so many! All this, with a drink, for about $9. Doug is a true gourmet master. Anyone who can work Fois Gras into a hot dog deserves a Nobel prize of some kind."
1291,"I have been waiting forever to get encased meats from the Doug. Finally on the coldest day of the year so far, we decided to wait outside for hot dogs. The only thing keeping the review of Hot Doug's from reaching 5 stars is the lack of heating lamps outside for the 20 minute wait. We had a Chicago dog, duck fat fries, and the pheasant sausage with truffle and foie gras. The run down: 1.) The Chicago Dog was good, but standard. If it was just the Chicago dog, the wait would have not paid off. 2.) The duck fat fries were delectible and come in huge portions. These are some bad ass MF's. My first instinct was to grab them and run home where no one could steal them from me. 3.) The big ticket item was the Pheasant Sausage with foie gras and truffle. I can not describe the goodness that is encased pheasant with such rich ingredients other than to say, bring a friend and split it. It is way too good to scarf it by yourself. I feel that had I not had a Chicago dog and split the Pheasant dog, I would have enjoyed it less. All in all a very solid experience. Doug was very friendly. Now that I have had the duck fat fries, I could stand going on a weekday and skipping the line."
1292,"I saw Hot Doug's on the food channel's ""hot dog mecca's"" show. I'm so glad I checked this place out. Some of the best variety of sausages anywhere and definitely with the best names. I mean, a ""Dave Kingman"" dog or a ""Salma Hayek"" (because the thing was ""Hot!"") The only thing I wasn't totally excited about was the Velveeta on my cheese fries, but even that seemed better than regular, sh*tty nacho cheese. Well worth the side trip if you like encased meats!"
1293,"It's the morning after and I am more in love than ever. Friday night I saw a picture somewhere of some of the things served at Hot Doug's and I had to have it in my belly...with no delay! Hearing about the line only made me more intrigued and my boyfriend and I decided to ditch the Taste of Chicago this year and instead focus on the taste of Hot Doug's. Our Best decision ever. We got there at 1:40 and the line was probably about 80 people long at that point. We needed these amazing dogs!! After 20 minutes the line behind us had another 20 or so people in it. It took us two hours to get into the gates of heaven. TOTALLY worth the wait! I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger sausage and a BLT sausage and a corn dog. My boyfriend got the crawfish dog and some fries. From the first bite I wanted to take my corn dog to the nearest church and marry the thing it was so good. My BLT sausage....the gods of belly bursting bliss were shining on it...yum, YUM, YUM!. Amazing. The cajun sauce on the crawfish dog with goat cheese...out of this world. If I was smart I would have ordered more to take home but I ended up taking home some of my bacon cheeseburger sausage with coca-cola BBQ sauce and jack cheese and loving it up a few hours later. Total perfection. Hot Doug's....I will be dreaming about you."
1294,"I had been dreaming of Hot Doug's since we first moved here in May but the hours are not work friendly. The hubs and I had our future condo inspected on a Friday at noon and then headed over after we received the news. My coworker could not understand how I wanted to try a chili cheese hot dog. I LOVE chili cheese hot dogs, preferably the ones I make at home. I'm a plain Jane, but do a love a good chili cheese hot dog, so for me to properly judge Hot Doug's I'd have to order something different. 35 minutes waiting outside, well worth it. Doug was so nice and patient with me, I really appreciated that. The steamed chili cheese hot dog was amazing. And, the duck fat fries, oh my god. At first I thought these taste just like every other fry, but as I put down fry after fry, I could taste how truly magical it was. I had a bit of the Elvis, and oh was that a tasty polish sausage! The hubs and I left very full and happy, so we went back today, Saturday and arrived at 11:30 am. Had we not loved our first adventure, we would not have waited outside 70 minutes! I don't think our toes fully thawed until we finished our meal today, ahhaah. I'm still very full 1.5 hours later. God, I love hot dogs and Doug, he makes a good hot dog!"
1295,"I hate it when people try to twist an original but, when they do it right, it's just fine by me... On my flight out before heading back to Chicago, my brother suggested we stop by Hot Doug's to grab a few. You can't leave without trying. At first I was skeptical because it was a 9am conversation about gourmet hot dogs. I said, ""Fine."" As we arrived I was amazed to see a line of people already waiting to get a bite at a Hot Dog place? Strange. Well, needless to say, I was amazed. We didn't even have a normal hot dog. I can't even remember the stuff we ordered but we had 7 Hot Doug's specials between us two with fries and drinks. I was inclined to order one just to have on the way to the airport. No Chicago eating experience is complete without this place. Strangest Hot Dogs on Earth but, it's one of the best I've had."
1296,"My heart quivered when I first heard about Hot Doug's foie gras and sauternes duck sausage dog. It sounded too good to be true. From then on, I knew I had to make my way to Chicago and eat here before I die. I made sure to arrive early at 11am, so the line wasn't too long... only about a 20 minute wait. There were so many different types of hot dogs, it was difficult to choose. A friend and I were finally able to narrow it down to 3 of the specials to share (I would have ordered more but knew I had a 20+ course dinner at Alinea that night. I had to exercise *some* self control!) The Order: * Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel * Cognac-Infused Lamb & Pork Sausage with spinach raita and manchego cheese * Saucisson Alsacienne Bacon Sausage with crme fraiche, carmelized onions and tomme de savoie The Foie Gras dog was my favorite by far. It was rich, juicy and deliciously sinful with the creamy foie gras mousse. The Lamb & Pork sausage was quite good - great meaty flavor, and I especially liked the cool contrast of the yogurt from the spinach raita topping. The only dog I didn't particularly care for was the Saucisson Alsacienne - it was too dry and salty. Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage = Heaven in a bun! Note: CASH ONLY"
1297,"When you live in Chicago....sometimes a Chicago-style hot dog just isn't enough. Granted, it's the best hot dog in the USA...but when the bar is set so high, how does one surpass it? Enter Hot Doug's. I don't care if there is a line going out the door. Foie Gras, Rattlesnake, Bison, Lamb, ApplePork, Chcken...these are a few of their specialty sausages that take the hot dogs at Hot Doug's to a whole new level. I ordered a hot dog here that tasted like a Gyro! Tzatziki sauce 'n all! Duck-fat fries are available on the weekends Yeah. And of course you get a Polish or Brat. I don't care if there is a line going out the door. Sometimes I still order a Chicago-Style! It's worth the wait! Just look at their ""Specials"" tab on their website: http://www.hotdougs.com/ ***CASH ONLY***"
1298,"I am sure this place has been reviewed and revisited more than the Civil War, However, I feel compelled, almost honor bound to throw in my two cents here. Every bite is like an orgasm for your mouth. I am qualifying this with the statement that I am a pretty picky person, I don't like new fangled things on my dog/sausage, Mustard is the only condiment I condone, that being said do not modify what ever he puts on the sausage, let it go, try it, be adventurous and you will be rewarded ten fold. Doug does not screw up, ever. weather it is sauerkraut and Gouda on an spicy sausage or elk, antelope, venison with blackberry butter, you will not be disappointed, he is simply a wizard with encased meats. One more thing to mention, I would suggest that you get a corn dog, I am pretty sure they are laced with something, it is the only explanation for how unbelievable they are, also on Friday and Saturday the fries are cooked in duck fat... just unbelievable, simply mind blowing, take the trip, bundle up (you are gonna have to wait in a line that extends outside) and enjoy the best dog or sausage in Chicago."
1299,"We had about 3 1/2 hours before our flight home so we thought we had to stop by this place. The best hot dogs in Chicago, right?.... or so it seems. It took us about 45 minutes to get here from downtown. We had all our luggage because we timed the trip to get to the airport after eating Hot Doug's and making it onto our flights with minutes to spare. We had to wait in line for about 1 1/2 hours in the freezing temperature. We finally got inside the door and warmed up a bit but still had to wait another 20 minutes! Because we waited so long, we ordered a lot! We got THE DOG, THE KEIRA KNIGHTLEY, THE SALMA HAYEK, THE GAME OF THE WEEK, which was BOAR, THE MARTY ALLEN, and a CORNDOG. I thought I would be blown away by a chicago hot dog. It is just a regular hot dog with relish, pickles and tomatoes... nothing special. The corndog was good but is there anyway to ruin a corndog? We also couldn't try to duck fat fries because it was on a day that they don't serve it. Everyone was raving about them so we wanted to try it but of course, Hot Doug's wasn't meant to be for us. Till this day, I ask myself if this was worth almost missing a flight and freezing to death on a COLD February afternoon--definitely NOT! We ordered 5 different things on the menu and we were the least bit satisfied. We got sick of one and ended up throwing it away after getting off the train near the airport. To me, the H in Hot Doug's stands for HYPE!"
1300,"The food is good and unique, but here's my beef. This place has limited hours and closes often for any reason they can think up. I've driven past there many times intending on going there to eat but they were closed. They also have limited seating relative to their sales. These two characteristics are obvious marketing ploys that many people are falling for. They've got the perfect combination of being exotic but still safe. If the lines are out the door then they must be popular, right? Well the line begins five feet from the door so if there are more than three customers then the line is going to be out the door. How many times do you see more than three customers at McDonalds? The difference is McDonald's and many other vendors of unhealthy food provide a certain level of customer service that Hot Doug refuses to."
1301,"Oh look. Yet another review for Hot Doug's. I usually make my annual pilgrimage here once a year (I live over an hour away, and it's really hard to rationalize traveling that far for a hot dog, so I wait til I find an excuse to be in the area), usually in Jan or Feb and at 2 or 3 in the afternoon. Still, despite my careful planning, there is ALWAYS a line. Which I don't actually mind. It gives me time to change my mind on what I had planned on getting, and then go back to my original idea. Several times. I always go for something that's on the specials list which are good, but this time I branched out and went for The Game of the Week, which was fantastic. Since they change all the time, it's not really worth mentioning in detail what it was, but if I'm ever faced with the opportunity to have an elk sausage again, I definitely will take advantage of that opportunity. I think the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the buns are a little on the forgettable side. Don't get me wrong, the dogs themselves are great, the topping combos are interesting and delicious, but if you're going to put all sorts of great stuff on a great dog, shouldn't the bun be great as well?"
1302,"As with everyone else...this place rocks. Went here for the first time last week and was fortunate that the chill in the air seemed to scare off the line. There were 6 of us which with the seating in there can be a challenge. We were in line for about 10 minutes, ordered and took an open table. About 5 min later out came the food. The Weisswurst I had was excellent as were the cheese fries I shoveled into my pie hole. I will be back to try more things. The BF has yet to be there so I am sure when they return from vacation at the end of Oct, we both will be there to great them. Side note: the service was excellent!! Not rushed and everything was explained well. For example: I was one of 2 Americans in the group; the other 4 were not fluent in English but this did not deter the workers."
1303,"What else can I add to the other 1000+ reviews? If you like encased meat, this place is the best of the best. Whether you stick with a classic Chicago-style dog or branch out to one of their specialty sausages, you won't be unhappy. In fact, you'll be really full of really yummy food. It's worth the line, but go at an odd hour to minimize line waiting. Cash only and the closest ATM is 2 block away (the woman in line behind me didn't realize this until she was almost at the register... I almost felt bad for her, except that she had clearly already gone past a number of ""cash only"" signs)."
1304,"Last time I was in Chicago, Hot Doug's was closed because Doug was on vacation. TRAVESTY! On my next trip to Chicago, I knew that I had to go here. My friend and I came here at 9:45am and we were third in line. Yes! When I was looking at the menu, I had a hard time deciding what to get because everything looked good. I decided to get 2 of their specials: the Foie Gras sausage and the bacon and cheddar elk sausage along with an order of duck fat fries and a small Coke. I figured if I was going to eat unhealthy, might as well go all out. By far, my favorite was the elk. The raclette cheese and bacon-garlic mayo they used was so delicious. I could definitely see why everyone raves about the Foie Gras. Personally I thought the duck fat fries was okay, but I could see why everyone likes them. Definitely more savory than the regular fries. Hot Doug's for breakfast put me into a food coma for the rest of the day, but it was worth it. Worth the hype!"
1305,"Dear mr. hot doug, You make me want to eat a hotdog dragged through the garden. I wish you had DFF (duck fat fries) on the menu every day of the week. Love, Stella ps. you look really hot when counting money. http://www.flickr.com/ph"
1306,"Minus one star for the horrible line. I mean I know it's not their fault they are so popular, but ambiance and everything else factors in to ratings, so yeah. You can't rate a place ""as good as it gets"" when you have to wait 2+ hours just to get a hot dog. I will say the food is pretty tasty. Duck fat fries are awesome and the various sausages are great. Not 2+ hour wait, great, though."
1307,"What can I say? The line was out the door and around the side, it was hardly moving, the place is a little bit bigger than a hole in the wall, the doors to enter were not that big but people were waiting patiently for there turn. I didn't get it until I got in and saw the menu on the wall. And then next to it was the specials. But the best part was when you got to the counter the gentleman taking your order was there for you! He didn't rush us, he answered all our questions, he was making jokes and all along listening to the kids and giving them suggestions. I couldn't decide what to order so I ordered 2 dogs. Between our entire group we ordered practically the entire menu; so, I can't recommend one specific item. I will go back but this time on Friday or Saturday to try the fries in duck fat."
1308,"Are the hot dogs good? Yes. Was it worth the hour and a half wait in line? No. Hot Doug's has some really good, unique hot dogs, but they aren't good enough to make me forget about the wait. The Chicago dog really wasn't anything remarkable, and the specialty dogs are good, but no better than a place like Franks 'n Dawgs, where I've never waited more than 5 minutes. I think if one waits in a line for this long, anything they eat is going to taste fantastic."
1309,"Oh, what the hell, since it's on the front page of Yelp every time I log in, and I've been here half a dozen times, I'll review Hot Doug's. It's good - probably the best hot dogs you'll ever have. However, you're still working within the limited range of Hot Dogs there - so bear that in mind while you're expecting culinary ecstasy. The duck fries aren't much better than the regular fries, and the line outside is annoying. But once you start eating at Doug's, the idea of going to another hot dog place just seems silly. You've already reached the pinnacle, so why bother with anything less? Fortunately for me, the hot dog craving comes only about every couple of months, so Doug's is more like a quarterly pilgrimage for me. If I was a true Chicagoan and needed a hot dog each week to survive, I'd be spending a lot more time standing on the corner of Roscoe & California, because there truly is no better place for them in the city."
1310,"Hour long wait outside. Cool, air-conditioned bliss inside. Prime rib sausage with double-cream brie. Duck fat fries. Great weekly sausage choices. Awesome prices. Empty seats when you're ready to eat (always). No cards, only cash. Free refills on fountain pop. Why haven't you been here yet?"
1311,Huge lines so leave lots of time. The big complaint from our groups was that there were too many options. The owner works the counter and I was told to know what I wanted and order quick but he was more interested in how I was doing today. Nice dude. Vege dogs were excellent. Worth a stop in you're in the area with an hour to kill.
1312,"Love it when someone is so passionate about their food. Doug's love for dogs and packed meats is evident the moment you walk in. Of course, you will be waiting outside for a while wondering if the wait will be worth it. I assure you it will. After a 20 minute wait, finally made it to the wall of menu items. By the time it was my turn, still was not quite decided. Although I presumed Doug might be a little nazi about his menu, he was very pleasant and asked what flavors I liked to help me decide. Had the Chicago dog and Jaleno Duck Sausage with Blood orange mustard. The ChiDog was amazing, clean flavors on a kaiser roll. The sausage was also good, but the blue cheese slices def. overpowers it. Must order the fries! Hand cut, crispy on outside and soft inside.....mmmm...."
1313,"I'm giving Hot Doug's a 5 star rating despite the fact that we waited outside in the cold for a long time because damn they can't help the fact that they are so popular (especially with the feature on No Reservations!!1). The food I had was amazing, the atmosphere of the restaurant itself is great, and Doug and the rest of his staff are very friendly. Even waiting in line was kind of fun; everyone was excited to go in and salivating at the smell of those peculiar hot dogs. After about a 45 minute wait, my friends and I were finally able to order. Remember, it is CASH ONLY, so remember to bring some. Also, the duck fat fries are only available on Friday and Saturdays! Anyway, I ordered the Foie Gras hot dog (made with a duck sausage? with truffle sauce and topped with foie gras slices) and an order of duck fat fries. It only took about 5 minutes for it to be ready and the first bite of that hot dog was pure heaven. So delicious! So savory! So rich! The serving of duck fat fries is huge, so make sure to share it with someone; don't make the mistake of having everyone order their own because trust me, you won't be able to finish it! I had a bite of my friend's (I think it had something to do with Jack Daniel's) and it was equally as delicious. I can't wait to go back there and try the Kangaroo dog."
1314,"I waited an hour and change for my brown ale buffalo sausage. Worth it? Definitely. My brother's bacon and duck sausage was really good too, and the standard Chicago style dog my brother also got was nothing less than impeccable. Skip the duck fat fries though. While tasty, I personally don't think they're worth the extra price premium over normal fries."
1315,"The fries made me sad today. They were alittle limp like a poop. The dogs were still steller, mmm. I got the smoked shrimp and pork dog with goat milk butter (which my friends, is a liquid orgasm, seriously. I love goat butter.) with havarti garlic cheese. Please make the fries hard, no one likes limp fries."
1316,"I try not to give five stars out too often, but this place deserves every single one of them. Their designer, gourmet dogs/sausages are not only delicious, but are hard to duplicate or find anywhere else in the city. If only they would open up a location the Loop, I would probably be 75 lbs heavier and a lot happier with life. :) The owner is cool and plays by his own rules. Yes, the lines are long. But keep the faith; it is well worth it!"
1317,"There's not too much to add about the flavor of hot dogs or the duck fat fries. Yes, they are tasty & innovative. However i have something to add about the line. I read here that the line moves fast. I guess fast is a relative term. :) I went yesterday and the line was outside the door on Roscoe - PAST the alley. I thought - 40 min max... I have to warn you - if you find yourself past the alley - you will get your hot-dog in about 2 hours. That's how long it took me. Now the question is - how bad you really want you dog."
1318,"There is nothing I can say about encased meats that has not already been written in a yelp review. What I can say, is that any wait you might encounter at Hot Doug's will be well worth it. When I had first moved to Chicago, we tried to eat at Hot Doug's, but the line was long and I was skeptical. No more. Doug is always happy and mindful of his customers. Your order is always brought hot, quickly, and delicious. I recommend the celebrity sausage, duck fat fries, and the traditional corn dog. If you have not been, this place is a must visit for any Chicago resident. I would go as soon as possible............"
1319,"Seriously, there's a reason why this place is so hot. We made the drive out there (plenty of street parking btw), waited in line for 20 minutes and it was worth every second! The food is awesome for the tiny bucks you'll spend. The energy is awesome and the crowd is electic- hipsters, families, yuppies, you name it. I'm a small girl but put away two hot dogs, cheese fries and two drink refills. The staff is incredibly friendly and happy to see you there. I have to admit that the hours and location make it oddly special and sought after...the experience makes it worth the planned trip."
1320,"My boyfriend and I were having the biggest (and most stupid) argument of all time, but I swear to god we made up the second we set foot in Hot Doug's. He devoured the duck fat fries (i wasn't a huge fan-too crispy), and I snarfed down my rabbit sausage. Pretty awesome concoctions. I can't wait for venison to come back on the game of the week menu. Plus! They have chocolate soda. SO awesome. So very good. No guilt."
1321,"I love Hot Dog's. I used to go there every day after high school when it was at it's old location. Everything about this place is wonderful, except maybe the long lines during lunch time. But it really is worth the wait. And I'm pretty sure that Doug is really Elvis Costello."
1322,"Here's how to have a good time at Hot Doug's: -Go with a group of 5 or more people. -Order every special on the menu (and some duck fat fries, if available). -Cut each one up into small pieces. -Try as many different hot dogs and sausages as you can. For some reason, while paying $7 for a single sausage seems expensive, paying $10 for bits of six different sausages seems more than fair. I went here with four other people, and for $40 we all walked (or perhaps hobbled) away stuffed. Well worth the 45-minute wait in line. Hot Doug's is one of Chicago's truly unique restaurants, marrying ""low class"" and ""high class"" cuisines flawlessly. I plan to bring all of my out-of-town visitors here; I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love it. I like that Doug personally mans the front counter at all times. He's way too nice for a guy who has to deal with the public for 5 hours every day. Also, he has really cool glasses."
1323,"Never, ever, ever again! The hot dog was good, but not fantastic. The other monstrosity that I ordered was utterly disgusting. I only ate 1/4 of it and threw the rest in the garbage where it should have been served in the first place. Now, I understand that it's a gamble when you order something new. But, at $9 or $10 a pop, it's like throwing money away in a recession. It just doesn't make sense. YUCK!"
1324,"With over 1000 reviews, what else can be said. I will say this... An amazing foodie bonding experience LONG REVIEW WARNING It was a cold Saturday afternoon, and I was on the prowl to hit Kuma's Corner to knock them of my ""To be reviewed"" list. AW and I were craving a burger, and when Kuma's hostess said 2+ hour wait we moved on. We went back to my vehicle ( A Ford Flex) and pulled places nearby up on the nav system and saw that Hot Doug's was nearby. Sweet! We joined the line and waited about 30 minutes in the blowing cold outside. As we reached the outer door the woman in front of us and the couple behind us began to chat with us. It was kind of like a concert ticket line, but with near instant gratification. As we neared Doug taking orders, I asked the line neighbors to sit with us. Kitten, Jean and Shawn, and Kyra and I selected our drinks (Kitten and I: Green River, Kyra: Sioux City Ginger Beer) and I went too secure a table while the others ordered. We collectively ordered the following: 3 orders of rendered duck fat fries A Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut (Rodger) A Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel (Kyra) An Elvis, a Polish prepared Chicago char style with additional items like sauteed onions and giardinera (Rodger) A The Pete Shelley, a meatless Chicago style Dog (Kyra) 2 The Mountain Man Sausage (a damn tasty combination of Venison, Elk, Antelope and Buffalo) with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese (Kitten, Shawn) Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Currant Dijonnaise, Port Wine Chicken Pate and Truffle-Balsamic Cream (Jean) Smoked Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and Iberico Cheese (Jean) Finally a Curry Lamb Sausage with Spinach Raita and Coolea Cheese. I tasted Kyras choices and mine. The Thai chicken sausage was perhaps the most amazing non Italian sausage I have ever tasted. The toppings made it divine. The Duck sausage was excellent, perhaps a bit subtle and sweet for my tastes. The Polish was crazy great, better than the Dear Franks char polish that was my current favorite. Finally, the vegetarian dog was excellent. Vegans, you can have an Authentic Chicago dog. You must not miss it! The food was absolutely Divine. The duck fat fries were one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted; light crisp and flavor packed. That said, the dining partners really made the meal special. Kyra is a singer songwriter with a day job in corporate communications, Kitten is an actress, writer, producer, Jean, Shawn and I are IT geeks of various flavors. This spontaneously assembled 5some had great conversation over amazing foods. We all took pictures of the experience and traded contact info for future meet ups if the logistics work out. It was one of my most memorable meals of all time."
1325,"My boyfriend has been wanting to try Hot Dougs for several months and I decided to take him today before driving him to the airport. We showed up at 10:30 am and there was already a line, but we only waited fifteen minutes. The food is excellent and while I wouldn't wait two hours for it I think it's worth the trip. Oh, and I bought a hat. My boyfriend summed up his feelings with this phrase: ""SON OF A BITCH, THEY HAVE TAB."""
1326,"This review is long overdue and Hot Doug's doesn't really need my review, but I'm going to write one anyway. A line begins before the place even opens (on a weekend anyway), speedy service, and amazing selection of hot dogs to choose from. Between 6 of us we ordered at least 12 different hot dogs and I don't remember which ones exactly, but they were all good. Even though this place has a constant line I would say it's worth the wait, where else are you going to find hot dogs like this?"
1327,"I used to work around here and my co-workers were always ordering. I loathe hotdogs (except when I was pregnant - I ate like 1,000) and have always been a little grossed out by not-dogs. Anyway, I love all the condiments and everything. I finally ordered a not-dog and it was good. It did creep me out a little because it tasted like real meat. I had to call and verify that it was indeed a fake-meat hot dog. Whoever I spoke with was very nice and proud of the kind of fake hot dogs they serve. Kudos for a place that serves duck-fat-french-fries for also serving quality meatless hot dogs. PS. It's been a few years, so I hope they still serve the meatless hot dogs!"
1328,"Why aren't there more places like Doug's??? So, so, so good. Every time I go, I get something that... 1. I have never had before. 2. I have never even though of having, and 3. I love so much that I get sentimental about it before I am halfway done. The last time I was there I had the wild boar sausage with goat cheese, sauterne, and fois gras- uptight nancy-pants aldermen be damned! They also have a great regular hot dog for the less adventurous, but why bother. Viva la duck fat!!"
1329,"We all know the one thing Hot Doug's is missing is Yelp reviews....oh they already have almost 1500....Well I'm here anyways. So I had been planning a hot doug's adventure for months and finally made it up with a group of ~10 friends. We waited in the cold for ~45 minutes only to be soothed by the smell of encased meats and the friendly smile of none other then Doug himself. Doug is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and doesn't have a problem with you ordering his dogs any way you want (I changed up his special just a bit). Our dogs came out fast...and we had a lot! I would reccomend getting at least 2 so you can try a variety. If possible split them with friends and try as many as possible. My three were: -Smoked Alligator with shrimp roumalade - Wow, this thing is awesome. Great flavor. and very different from your standard sausage - The Atomic Bomb - Spicy pork sausage with spicy mango mayonaise. this had a great kick to it and also amazing flavor. If its on the menu, get it. - I also had the Duck Sausage with foie gras moose and fluer del sel. This one was interesting. It was a little too rich and I don't think I really had the palette to enjoy it. Yes I just said my palette wasn't refined enough for encased meat. This is still and excellent sausage though and I think Doug was trying to make a statement of what a sausage can be. Overall, it was a great experience and I will be back for the duck fat fries. and to try another round of special dogs."
1330,"There is no shortage of great hot dogs in Chicago. But judging by the rating and the over 1,400 reviews I think Hot Doug's may be one of the best. The line to order is also an indication. The place was crowded and lively on a weekday early afternoon. I went with several associates. There is something for everyone in this place, even rattlesnake and ribeye sausages. I have a weakness for andouille, so I tried that. It was good but not really as good as I expected. Chicago is too far from Lafayette I guess. But the Italian Sausage (aka the Sollozzo) was excellent. One of the top five italian sausages of all time. Definitely worth a return trip."
1331,"I really love meat. I tried going vegetarian for a year, but I couldn't handle the denial of my love for animal flesh. While I respect vegetarians, I'll eat twice as much meat to make up for what they're missing. Hot Doug's only makes it easier to eat lots of meat. Although I've never had an entire normal hot dog from here (I've only had a bite or two), I imagine it's good, but not as tasty as their gourmet hot dogs. Those things are deadly on the body and pocket. They're too good! So far, I (inspired by Anthony Bourdain) have had the fois gras hot dog with gratuitous slices of duck foie gras. I don't know where else you can get a hot dog like this, so this was a real treat. I've also had the Saucisson Alsacienne, which is/has: ""Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Crascenza Cheese."" Dee-licious. Best hot dog I've ever had in my life. Although the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage (topped with Sriracha mustard and seaweed salad) was delectable as well, it doesn't compare to the Saucisson Alsacienne. Doug made me pronounce it and didn't humiliate me too much when I butchered the pronunciation. Fries were okay, but I didn't pay much attention to them because I came here for the hot dogs, and I'll be back for more despite the long wait. It's wellllllllll worth it."
1332,"Waited 1.75 hrs on a warm spring Friday (Fridays and Saturdays have longer lines for the duck-fat fries that are only available on these days). It was a pleasant wait--there was a family playing ""I Spy"" behind me, and two co-workers who were obviously attracted to each other in front of me. *note* most people were locals, to dispute any fears of it being too touristy, not that tourism is bad for our city or its fine encased meat establishments. I got the BLT dog... it tasted like a BLT... and the Dog.. which is a Chicago dog.... although, I have to be nit-picky about this one... ""everything"" on the Chicago style dog did not include sport peppers. I LOVE the Chicago dog, but the absence of sport peppers was sorely felt *note*you can add sport peppers, no additional cost or anything. I just didn't read and assumed the dog would come with them. Chicago dog= boiled or steamed dog, poppy seed bun, tomato, relish, onion, celery salt, pickle, mustard, and sport peppers. So if you are a tourist planning on eating a Chicago dog at the best encased meats establishment in the world, do it right and make sure you get the sport peppers. My bff got this spicy calaberese pork sausage that was AMAZING. I was very jealous. Jealous enough to come back and try all their wild, wonderful sausages. We also had duck fat fries. Good, and enough for 2-4 people. The five stars is all about Doug."
1333,The place ROCKS!!! Went before the Cubs Phillies game and we were worried they would close the doors as the line was to the backyard alley. Waited for 1hr15 minutes and had the DOGS of our LIFE. Well worth the wait... owner is genuine as they come an the dogs exotic and tasty! Get there with plenty of time so you are not turned away from hot dog heaven.
1334,"The trip would have been just perfect if it wasn't 50 degrees, windy and raining that visit. Go on a nice day because no matter what time you do go, there will be a line out the door. Good things come to those who wait.... And as we waited, our excitement and hunger grew. I think we changed our minds a dozen times before we hit the counter but settled on these: Grilled hot dog with the works: perfect Chicago dog The Sally Vega Corn dog: our 12 year old insisted it was the best dog she has had Foie GRAS duck sausage: good but not a do over Thai chicken sausage: spicy and the favorite of us all but not on regular menu And do not forget the duck fat fries, yes they taste better than regular fries and yes they are with it. Overall, I think this is the hot dog spot to go in the city and to try something a bit different. It was not, for me, the Chicago place I will move mountains to get back to. My heart belongs to the sushi, Thai, and Indian restaurants."
1335,"Been coming here since 2006. I always get the Jenny Garner. Yummy ass food in general. Great Fries. I mean, DUCK FAT?? Heaven..... Creative fun names for their dogs. Good greasy choice meats n cheeses for your alcohol soaked belly. Friendly service. Long lines that seem to fly by. Ostrich meat, check. Alligator, check. Monkey balls, check. Monkey balls, i mean why not. I bet if these guys charred and spiced that stuff up and threw it on a bun you'll annihilate it in seconds. YES YOU WILL. I bring all my outta town friends to this place by default. And even when they get lucky and get laid in chicago, they don't ask about the girl, or her name, or any of that. Noooooo........ They ask me to fedex em something off the menu of Hot Dougs. I mean really. This has happened at least 4 times, man. Very much worth it. Will definitely make a vegan repent back to good meaty murder."
1336,"Hot Dougs. How can I not review this place, regardless of how many have come before me? I am an extreme latecomer to the Hot Doug's bandwagon, having intended to go there for the last 2+ years but only making the trip in late '07. My first time, I was in the area running errands on a Saturday afternoon, and it was bitter, bitter cold outside. The line still wrapped around the corner of Roscoe and almost to the alley. As I was watching, the line was always moving so I decided to brave it. I stood with all the veteran Hot Doug's patrons, who were all talking about what they were going to order, what they had ordered in the past, etc. The girl behind me was ordering just a single regular hot dog and fries... considering all the incredible specialties, I was impressed that the regular, buck seventy five hot dog was that awesome that someone would wait 30-40 minutes in freezing cold for one. You get to the counter and regardless of the fact that they are slam-packed busy, Doug will ALWAYS have a kind word, usually a joke or two for you before he takes your order, and if you want a recommendation he is usually dead on. After my initial visit, I went through a hardcore addiction phase where I was going several times a week (almost never a wait of more than a couple minutes on Mon-Thurs), but have slowed down to once a week or every other week now. Formula for a perfect business? Keep it simple, be better than everybody else at what you do, charge a fair price, and be good to your customers. Hot Doug's exemplifies all four of these points each and every time I set foot inside."
1337,"OMG!!! I didn't know that hot dogs could taste so GOOD until I tried HOt DOUG's! I recently went to Chicago to visit a friend. She said we have to check it out so we did. i was only in Chicago for 3 days but went to Hot Doug's TWICE! I'm definitely going back to Chicago for some more Hot Doug's! We waited in line for an hour every time but it was so worth it. I wouldn't mind waiting even wait longer. Its only open from 10-4pm so go either really early or really late to avoid lines. If you go with friends, the wait is really not too bad. If you happen to be alone, def take your ipod or DS or whatever. If you're from cali, pls dress warm. It gets REALLY windy there. I loved the Paul Kelley and Spicy Thai chicken sausage. You must try the duck fat fries, you won't regret it! ps. You get to meet Doug Sohn bc he takes your order. He is so nice! My friends and I were wondering if he's half korean or not (bc of his last name) but forgot to."
1338,"three words: FANTASTIC, exotic, yummy. The line is a little much, but don't get there at 3pm or later (it closes at 4). Use that head of yours! A smallish wait if you come at the right time (30 min) is definately worth your dollar here for the game dogs. The fries are not all that spectacular. It will have you coming back again."
1339,"Next time I decide to write a business plan, I'm going to kidnap ""Doug"" and gank every idea from his genious brain. Honestly, I really don't get it. Granted, this place is good-but, not THAT good to stand out in the snow and ice for 90 minutes. Yesterday, I just happened to be driving on California, and noticed for the first time, that there was no line outside. Oh wait, did I see a parking spot right outside the front door? Oh, yes indeed! Now, I should say upfront that I am no fan of Chicago dogs. Actually, I think they suck. But, I do like brats, and opted for the ""Dave Kingman."" Now, this was a really good brat-but, once again, it wasn't orgasm in my pants amazing. Very friendly, and quick service. Tasty brat, fries, and reasonable prices. I would return-but, I sure as hell won't wait more than 10 minutes. *Budakis on Damen is just as good, sans long lines."
1340,"Next time I make it out to Chicago, I am bringing a tent and camping right next to this amazing hot doggery. My friend made a special point to take me to Hot Doug's last time I blew through the windy city and I must say I am truly thankful he did. Not only does Hot Doug's shed light on just about everything you can do with a standard sausage (rattlesnake? alligator? whipped-cream and bananas?), they also rock out the extras - the toppings I mean: Gorgonzola cheese and cherry-drizzle, spicy-Thai peanut sauce. The setting is great too, and of course the place is packed, but then again waiting outside in the cold just makes savoring the hot dog that much better. Now if only they had some sort of crazy delicious side-dish like duck-fat fries... oh, wait a minute they do!"
1341,"As of this review, I've only been to Hot Doug's once. It took me almost a year to try this place out after I moved to Chicago, and at that point, the hype was out of this world. Imagine a year of hype building up, and then waiting in line for an hour in the cold, and then finally getting inside, and waiting in line for another 20 minutes because that's how long the lines are, but now you are inside and smelling all the hot dogs and fries and whatnot. Also, at this point you are really hungry because even though you were well aware of the notorious nature of the lines due to their laughably short hours of operation, you came just a little hungry to begin with. But now the pain is intolerable. Anyway, all that being said, I'll just reiterate what a thousand people have already said before me: It's worth the wait, it lives up to the hype, the special dogs are very creative and will constantly challenge your preconceived notions of what you can pile on (or in) a hot dog."
1342,"Worth the wait, especially on duck fat Fridays/Saturdays. Not a place I take vegan/vegetarian friends. My advice: try everything. If you get full, come back tomorrow. It'll be worth the wait then, too."
1343,"Beware of the ""OH MY GOD I WAS ON FOOD NETWORK THING"" I can fault the place. Cheese on cheese fries was very milky tasting and underwhelming. Stood in line with all the other suckers who saw it on TV. Hot dogs were too by the book not much better or worse than most other places. I fail to see the hype. I do give them points for trying."
1344,Excellent hole in the wall atmosphere and wonderful hot dogs and sausages!! PROS: - quick service (even with long lines) - efficient seating - GREAT hot dogs and quality toppings - very friendly and helpful staff CONS: - NONE!!
1345,"If encased meat is the specialty, why cover it in so much ""stuff""? Why not let the meat be the highlight. First, let me explain that my husband is OPPOSED to waiting in line to pay his money to anyone. Secondly, he LOVES food, meat in particular. Thirdly, he works hard for his money. Now that we have that out way. Had Chicago style dog. I am team Gene and Judes on this one. It was just a Chicago dog. And the bun was a bit soggy. A firm average dog. I know that many will find this blasphemous, but I call it as I see it. Had the alligator sausage. The meat itself was kind of tasty,but the toppings overwhelmed the meat. The cheese was thick and cold and again made the bun soggy. Hubby had the tueben. Sauerkraut was cold and the bun soggy. Tasted like a cold sauerkraut sandwich. The Diet Coke was good. You know how McDonald's has the ""good"" Diet Coke, well so does Hot Doug's. My husband says the Diet Coke was the best thing we had from there. Me, well, the fries were better than the soda. Would I suggest waiting an hour in line for a good Coke and decent fries? Only if you are extremely bored and looking to meet people in new and exciting environments. Maybe we aren't hip enough, our palette not refined enough or it was just an off day. Either way, if you must(like we ""musted"") then by all means go ahead. But not worth the wait nor the price. Affordability is subjective, but time is pretty concrete."
1346,"Hot Doug's is one of my favorite restaurants! The owner, Doug takes the orders, everyday. My husband and I share a drink and we ordered a large our first time there only to be told by him, ""Why not get a small?, it's free refills, and it's cheaper!"" I appreciate that. He gets to know his customers. It's busy but I've never really had to wait long. The food is AMAZING. Great flavor combinations, innovative combinations and ingredients, delicious food! I take ALL of my out of town guests there...and they all have LOVED it! The only cons *and I'm being picky*: Crowded because it is small, Cash Only, Inconvenient Hours (including lots of time closed around holidays or for vacations) Pros: Great Service, Excellent Food, Great Atmosphere (& Music!) Edit: Hot Doug's continues to shine! I went in yesterday and had the Veal, Pork and Parsley Weisswurst with Bock Beer Mustard and Port Derby Cheese and it was amazing as always!"
1347,"Oh. My. God. I rarely give 5 stars. But this was a no brainer. We were on a mission to find the perfect Chicago dog -- I've heard so much about it but have had yet to try it myself. We were determined. After a few flukes, I found this place. The line was long, which we took to be a good sign, bc heck, ppl wouldn't wait this long for a crappy dog right? The line moves fast, we were waiting 10 minutes, 15 mins tops. They have plenty of tables inside and an outdoor area too. And, after you order, it comes out within a few mins too - straight to your table. Talk about great service! - duck fat fries(3.50) - thin cut fries, not as much of the ""duck"" taste as i hoped there would be, but greasy and soggy all the same. yum! seriously! - lamb sausage($7) - with bits of mint in the sausage and topped with feta and crumbled kalamata olives. very very flavorful. - bratwurst (3.50) - wow. my fave BY FAR. slight beer flavor but in a good way. and when it's fully loaded with all the toppings - it really just can't be beat. - veggie dog (2.75) - he said it's better than most he's had. but c'mon, it's a veggie dog. whatever. - tator tots (2.50) - he was really excited when he heard someone in front of us ordering tator tots. so we got 'em too. but they're tator tots. nothing new or exciting here.. now if they dipped this in duck fat too, that's a whole new story... =D"
1348,"This is based on multiple trips there. Every time has been wonderful. The most recent time we split four sausages, including the foie gras duck sausage, the spicy wild boar sausage, the mozzarella and bell pepper chicken sausage, and the buffalo blue cheese pork sausage. We've had at least ten different sausages and hot dogs there, and every one of them has been quality. The service is of course awesome. Doug Sohn, the demi-god of encased meat, is always behind the counter ready to take your order and guide you through the menu. Not sure why they even sell a large soda since he will do his best to get you to order a medium and take free refills. The folks brining out your food are efficient. Despite the sometimes insane lines you never feel rushed once you enter into this sausage shangri-la. The one thing to be careful of when you enter there is not to have the ""mismatched buffet food"" effect hit you. Think about when people eat at a huge all-you-can-eat buffet. They come back to their table with a plate loaded with pizza, prime rib, sushi, and chocolate cake. All good on their own, but not the right things to have together. The choices here can cause a small version of that. The spicy boar sausage for instance was so powerful that it overwhelmed the more subtly spiced or sweet-topping covered ones we had ordered. Be careful with the order in which you eat the sausages, or just plan multiple trips, with a theme for each order! Waiting in line in the blowing snow on a winter's day with other people anxiously waiting to get inside felt like a bonding experience, something uniquely Chicago. This place is worth waiting in the snow. It is worth spending 2 hours in line on a pleasant summer day. It is worth crawling on hands and knees over broken glass through the desert. Anything to get to the counter and place an order for a Foie Gras dog with Duck Fat fries."
1349,"COMPLETELY worth the hour wait! So good! Ok so I am not a Hot Dog fanatic or anything of that sort but I am a foodie so when my friend explained that this was THE place to go (even featured on the Food Network) I had to go! The line went slow...and I was hungry by the time I reached Doug. That's right Doug! The owner kindly greets each and every one of you in that line...(of about 130 people). I have to admit I was instantly impressed when he gave the lady and her kids in front of us a break on the cost of their meal since they were short on cash -and its a cash only venue. He doesn't try to rush you one bit - so be prepared for a wait...but you'll have time to peruse the menu and you wont get shot if you ask for a recommendation ...he's not like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. (although as I was getting hungrier I was kind of wishing he was-but that's part of the charm). We were able to find a seat easily and the bussers even brought us over some knives and forks when we explained that we wanted to cut our hot dogs to share...I didnt even have to ask- he offered : ) We each ordered 2 dogs a piece to split- we went with : Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Moody Blue Cheese $8 - My favorite sooooo delicious but very filling Chili Cheese and Onion Dog - ~$2 pretty basic The Elvis- Bratwurst (plus we added Kraut) $2.50 - Also one of my favorites The Sonoran Dog: Jalapeno and Cheddar Beef Dog with Jalapeno Mayonnaise, Jalapeno Bacon, Pinto Beans, Tomatoes and Onions $5.00 - Too spicy for me but good flavor and of course the Duck Fat Fries- Good -definitely enough to share with 3-4 people All in all I was very impressed- I loved Hot Dougs! Check it out if you're in Chicago !"
1350,"Oh man, this place is tasty. I love encased meats. This is encased meat heaven! I really enjoy trying all sorts of different exotic meats perfectly paired with rare cheese and tasty sauce/ garnishes. And on a bun? Whoa. I've tried rabbit, antelope, etc... etc... Seriously, this place is genius. The duck fat fries? Wow. Extra flavor and tons of them. However, this place has a lot of downsides. 1. Always a huge half hour line out the door. Why not move to a larger space, or at least have more than one register? 2. Not open for dinner and far away. It's extremely hard to get here in time to eat lunch. With the long line and the drive time to get all the way out there, there's no way it will work unless you get two hours for lunch. 3. Cash only- With sausages costing as much as $9.00, this place should take cards. And there's NO ATM. So if you didn't bring cash you just waited a half hour in line for nothing (happened to me). It seems that Doug knows his food is the best and makes enough to be happy with it. But shouldn't the owner of such a popular restaurant have a social responsibility to make things as easy as possible for the customer? He could be raking in the cash with a large place in Lakeview. I would go there once a week but it's such a pain in the ass."
1351,The line keeps getting longer but the food stays the same level of delicious. TIME TO OPEN ANOTHER FRANCHISE!!!
1352,"One of the things I was looking forward to at Hot Doug's was meeting Doug himself. He's funny, witty, and makes me want to see him again and again. I don't know why but I'm a little disappointed to know that Doug doesn't make his own sausages. I feel it would add so much authenticity to a place that already has a loyal following. That being said, the standard Chicago dog was delicious. I love how you have the option of how the dog will be cooked. Charred was the obvious choice. The rib-eye sausage with chimichurri and fried onions was a bit tough. The flavor wasn't what I was expecting either. I hate to admit it but I actually liked my original better and it was 1/4 the price. The duck fat fries were outstanding as well. Not the best I've had but they were perfectly salted and pleasantly crunchy. Would I be back? Maybe. If there wasn't a line I would definitely be back. I just wish the sausages were made in house. It would lure me back much faster."
1353,I swear I have never ever in my life ate anything more delicious than hot dougs. Just thinking about eating it makes me have a orgasm in my mouth. there is no more to say it's that good
1354,"WOW! I never thought of hot dogs as a real meal, but this place corrected that. I am saddened to say that its only open till 4pm Mon-Sat, but on those days I can play hooky from work, its the destination for a sunny afternoon. Expect a line almost any time of the day. But, its sooo worth the wait. Spend time reviewing the menu on the wall, and debating the choices. Also, don't forget that you can get the sausage grilled/charred, boiled, or your level of deep fried. This is not to be confused with health food. This is an epicurean delight for people who enjoy food. Don't forget the duck fat fried fries, only available Fri/Sat. Its a nice way to top the meal off. Though, I just get 2 dogs and call it a day w/ the one of the awesome drink choices. How many places stock Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray?? My recommendation is the Don Rickles w/ a Game of the Week pick. http://www.hotdougs.com You can take the California exit off of 90/94 and just head North. Its on the SW corner of Roscoe and California."
1355,"Hot Doug's? Jesus Christ! THIS is awesome! Kinda, sorta built out of the old neighborhood south of gordon Tech high School and smack in the middle of nothing is this oasis. Pure genius to be appreciated while it's here! Not a dog joint for the neighborhood wino who needs something cheap and stupid: a true challenge to everything we know as hot dog culture and an amazing experience... and yeah, the lines are worth it. Get creative; you can't possibly regret trying this place!"
1356,"Delicious! Even the wait around the side of the building isn't bad because it gives you a chance to socialize with other Hot Doug enthusiasts who are happy to share their opinions on the ""must-order"" items. Most people will tell you to order the duck fat fries; which are only available on Fridays and Saturdays. They are good, don't get me wrong. I just don't see all the hype. My tip would be to order one of the many gourmet sausages that change daily, be it the bacon and cheddar elk sausage or the herb chicken sausage with brie and pear, but make sure to get a Chicago style hot dog as well. Trust me, you'll thank me for this tip because you won't want to get back in line and even if you aren't a big eater you won't be able to help yourself - it's all so good. Not to mention the friendly greeting you get from the owner, Doug himself and the decor is just so darn cute!"
1357,"Doug is the best. 5 stars for Doug alone! Every time I go, I try and get a fancy sausage (one of the weekly specials: tequila chicken sausage with black beans or jalapeno duck and bacon sausage - with exciting toppings like mango salsa or gorgonzola cheese, respectively); and a regular hot dog. Until two trips ago, when I ordered the veggie corn dog for the first time and holy moly!!! I will never go back to a regular hot dog (though they are delicious as well). A friend of mine swears by the Don Rickles (and really, with a name like that, how could it be bad?) An old roommate of mine once got the rattlesnake sausage. I greatly enjoyed the Paul Kelly (bratwurst) on my first-ever visit. Are the duck fat fries better than the regular fries? You bectha. But don't feel bad if you don't wanna splurge - the regular fries are great as well. The only thing that could make Hot Doug's better is: 1) a location near work and 2) open longer hours or on Sundays On second thought, nah, it's perfect how it is. I don't need to gain 100 pounds. ;)"
1358,"Is there a better hot dog(s) in the best hot dog city in the world? NO. Last time I went to Hot Doug's I ordered four dogs... wait, that's every time I go to Hot Doug's :) I would recommend trying their game meat dogs. Life is short... eat through it. And their duck fat fries kick ass! Go, Doug!"
1359,"Sometimes on rainy Seattle nights, I wake up thinking about Hot Doug's. I think about the Game of the Week, which might be boar or snake or pheasant. I think about the creative toppings that are judiciously applied to a hot dog bun and served with french fries that sometimes come cooked in duck fat. I do my best NOT to think about the fact that Doug's is 2400 or so miles from where I live, but inevitably that realization surfaces and all I can do is rock back and forth and cry myself to sleep. I bought a Hot Doug's t-shirt and I wear it around town, roaming the streets and simultaneously talking to no one and everyone about The Sausage Superstore. If I'm feeling really festive I sing one of the Hot Doug's theme songs. I'm a little closer to understanding what possesses a man to become a street preacher. The next time you're on the street in any big city and someone nearby is talking loudly to no one in particular, don't just assume it's the gibberish of a homeless guy who ran out of insurance money and didn't get his meds. Don't just write it off as some fancy stock broker making high stakes 6-figure trades on a bluetooth hands free earpiece that you can't see. It very well could be another Chicago transplant, another now devoid soul, who foolishly went back to the Windy City for Thanksgiving only to discover that Doug closed up shop for the long weekend. This rambling person might teach you something, something significant and life-changing, something about what can be done with encased meats that your senses will never forget. Think I'm exaggerating? Ask the 200 or so other folks who gave it 5 stars. Ask anyone in the line that forms before he opens, wraps around the building and down the street, and stays thick until closing time. Hot Doug's is like that."
1360,"I do love a good hot dog, and this place is the tits!! (I don't like to use such terminology, but I felt Sausage and slang pair well) I started with a classic Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the classic trimmings, especially that neon green relish; and it was SO good. Next came the the Calvados: Infused Smoked Duck Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey... I never thought a tubed meat product could ever be so tastetastical -- My lady-friend and I shared some fresh-cut fries with cheddar sauce, and I would opt for no cheddar next time because it IS NOT cheese, it's a thick Velveeta-esque sauce. The fries were good though. And since I won't be back there anytime soon, the gluttony had to continue with the Citrus-Burgundy Pork Sausage that had a Red Wine Grainy Dijon Mustard and Smoked Gouda Cheese bits all over the top. This was not my favorite because the Gouda wasn't melted, so it sort of overpowered the flavor of the sausage. the Classic Chicago-style cannot be beat for the price. Eat 3 of them."
1361,"Hot Dougs totally broke our hearts. Allow me to explain the tragic tale that IS our venture to Hot Dougs, Chicago. My boyfriend and I schlepped our asses here in a cab from Wrigley after the Angels/Cubbies game (Angels won, holla!). We came all the way from California for baseball, good times, good food, and the Hot Dougs dogs. We got there at 4:10PM on a Saturday only to have an employee shut the door on us and tell us they CLOSE AT 4. Ok, I know we should have checked that out beforehand but as Jesus would say, WTF?! 4PM on a Saturday? That is like a breakfast place closing at 8AM or Britney Spears wearing underwear: Just unheard of. My boyfriend asked the guy to let us in to get a dog but the life-ruiner employee was unsympathetic. I am sure the food is great but if you saw the sad puppy dog faces we sported you would hate Hot Dougs, too. Cab Fare: $39 round trip. Airfare/Hotel: $1200. Not getting the perfect Chicago Dog: Priceless."
1362,"Dammit Hot Doug's, open up a bigger place!! The hope and promise of meaty goodness is what kept us alive (albeit half frozen) after that 1+hr wait on a weekday afternoon in the damp and cold in the middle of January... (So much for going on an ""off time"" on a Monday!!) We ordered the foie gras topped duck sausage. For good measure we also ordered a dog spiced with curry and cranberry chutney, another duck filled dog and a pork dog with a mustard sauce. And a small (giant) order of cheese fries. We inhaled everything on our table and most of the items were tasty, but the pork dog with the mustard was my least fave. The mustard was really strong. Like I'm cringing now just thinking about how strong that mustard was. I'd go back. In the summer. On a weekday. Early as hell."
1363,I make a point of stopping by Hot Doug's every time I'm in Chicago. I've never had much of a wait here and I'm chalking that up to my townie friends knowing the best times to visit. Always a stellar culinary experience with exotic meats. There's been a lot of to-do about the duck fat fries; I tried them when a friend ordered some and would rather spend the money on another hot dog. Encased meats all the way! Bring on the alligator/antelope/boar!
1364,"There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats,' my friend. I would wrestle a bear to have this place in my home town. Yes, the wait is long but I have never been more certain that it was worth it than the day I mustered the gumption to patiently wait 1.5 hours to achieve a glorious spread of four savory sausages and to be dumbfounded by delectable duck fat fries. I was in a sausage stupor for the remainder of the afternoon. We ordered the Sauternes Duck Sausage with Fois Gras mousse, the Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Remoulade and Blue Cheese, Merguez Lamb Sausage with Harissa and Goat Cheese, and a simple Chicago dog named the Marty Allen. I wish I could describe the flavor of the duck sausage with fois but the flavor was so subtle and beautiful that any words I express here would just be an injustice to the Tour de Force that it is. When I think about that hour in which I was being sated by the glory that is Hot Doug's, I start to believe that memory will meld into my subconscious enjoyments the way the smell of my grandmother's house did or what it was like to make a fort out of sofa cushions as a child. Is this all hyperbole? You can't afford to doubt me and be wrong. Despite the last paragraph, I am not a generous person when it comes to restaurant reviews so I hope that this grand review conveys some inkling of the enjoyment I had eating here. On top of the food quality, the service was great. We waited in line for 1.5 hours to get to the counter and realize it was cash only. I repeat: Cash Only, so take heed. Even still, I quickly asked a server if there was an ATM I could run to and he said just put the order in and you can pay us after you eat. Awesome! What trust! They weren't even annoyed by this request! So if you even find yourself in the tri-state area and have a remote chance of going, you should. I don't think you could forgive yourself if you knew what you missed."
1365,"I still love it! After coming here last Friday before Doug closed for the next two weeks. I usually get the foie gras dog and a Thuringer or brat-something off the permanent menu and something off the special menu but the Hot Sauce Chicken Sausage with ""Buffalo"" Mustard and Smoked Moody Blue Cheese seemed interesting. I asked him if it was good and he said it was-not that I expect him to say no, it's disgusting and I can't wait to get rid of it. It WAS good though, with the blue cheese it reminded me a lot like a buffalo wing. I went Thuringer this time which was as delicious as ever with some mustard and onions-always a good call. I like the bratwurst but sometimes it can be hit or miss the Thuringer is not as tasty as a good brat here but it's more consistent. I also tried the 30 sausage chili which is really huge, a lot of sausage actually and quite filling but okay."
1366,"An hour wait...nothing is worth an hour wait. Here's what I tried after being thoroughly annoyed. Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Sweet Curry Mustard, Vintage Van Gogh Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves The Atomic Bomb Spicy Pork Sausage with Spicy Prickly Pear Cactus Mayonnaise and Cheese Medley Apple-Habaero Chicken Sausage with Lime-Ancho Mayonnaise and Chipotle-Jack Cheese The spicy pork was the best and the only one I'd eat again if I can ever make it through the line again. The texture of the Apple-Habaero Chicken Sausage wasn't that appealing and the Uber Garlic Pork Sausage was totally overwhelmed by the cheese. Actually, I could have done without the cheese on all three. It took too much away from the meat. I guess you have to try it, but you better not be hungry when you arrive because you'll be waiting outside for awhile."
1367,"The first time my dad took me here I saw a bunch of people waiting outside a line and first thought that came to my mind was ""Why is my dad taking me to an unemployment agency?"" But then I realized the people I saw looked pretty well off and a bunch of yuppies. I LOVE Hot Dougs. I look forward to every week when I do laundry because my dad comes back to the laundromat with something from Hot Dougs in hand. I have yet to try their duck fat fries (my dad always goes on Thursdays so I always miss the days they have it) and their special games (I've been too scared to try them but I will soon!). I'm already salivating just writing this. My boyfriend thinks it's overrated and my mom is not much for hot dogs so this place is me and my dad's special place. If you live in Chicago and has never been to Hot Dougs, you are seriously missing out."
1368,"My life as a Chicago resident was Clearly Deprived - I can't believe I never had Hot Doug's. This has been the best re-introduction to Chicago life, ever. HOT DOUG'S!!! Just like on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations... but more importantly, in my old neighborhood! How can you not love an ""encased meat emporium"" that has its own theme song and serves fois gras fries!? I tried both the ""Jalapeno and Bacon Duck Sausage with Blood Orange Mustard and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey"" and the ""Cherry Pork Sausage with Cassis Mustard and Cocoa Cardona Cheese"" - both were phenomenal, but I think I liked the cherry pork the best. The cocoa-dusted cheese just put me over the top. Oh, and I tried a bite of the rattlesnake, which was also amazing (albiet a bit spicy). However, there is no way that anything that comes from this establishment is bad... if sausage was good for you, I'd choose to eat at Hot Doug's constantly. It was definitely worth the 1 hr. + wait in the cold to get a mouthful of this amazing meaty goodness. I Love Chicago and I Love Hot Doug's!"
1369,"Even on a Wednesday, two hours before closing, it was a packed house w/a 30 minute line out the door. Ordered: 1 Classic, very good, but without the nice 'snap', awesome fixin's 1 Duck, very good w/the gouda. 1 Antelope, OK, spicy sweet, cheese overpowered. 1 Goat, the loser of the day, the Caribbean flavors were totally off & the Pepto color was off putting. About $25 for all the dogs plus a soda on tap, weird no bottled water or unsweetened iced tea. I guess those are a little too healthy for an encased meat joint? Wait, I take it back, add another $40 on top for the roundtrip cab ride from the hotel. Hours 10am-4pm, Duck Fat Fries are only served on Fridays & Saturdays. May be able to avoid lines w/a phone order, minimum $25. I liked this place, I didn't feel heavy at all and loved the pillowy soft bun! Doug works hard w/a smile, holding down his fort & taking care of biz."
1370,"*SIGH* Mr. Doug, I adore you. I love watching those programs on the Travel Channel about food places across the US. After seeing a particular episode on hot dogs, I was very taken with this place, and the lovely owner as well. I was already enamored with the idea of Hot Doug's, but then I started hearing so many great things from friends in Chicago, and that just made me more excited about it. This summer, I went to Chicago on break with friends, and I finally got to make my dreams come true (wow, that came out really cheesy!). The walls are covered in really fun trivia and decor, keeping your eyeballs working before, during and after the meal. Mmm, the Kiera Knightley (Fire Dog) was so amazing! Spicy and meaty, and so good with the toppings! And although I wasn't able to get the duck fat fries, I'll have to say, the regular fries were really great anyway! I'm a big fan of fried potato products, and that just worked for me. FYI: The restroom was spotless and really... cute (for lack of a better word at the moment), and a clean restroom is a good sign, for sure! :)"
1371,"Love, love, love. Worth the wait, but definitely try to get there around opening if at all possible. You see the line stretching on forever and yet once you get inside you seem to always be able to get a seat. Owner is the nicest guy around, duck fat fries made my life better, and dogs were phenomenal. Everyone should try Doug's foie gras dog before they die. Tube-shaped heaven in your mouth. *ahem* Seriously, beyond amazing."
1372,"After many a recommendation and much hype to this encased meats emporium, it was time to give this puppy a shot. Tucked into a small cafe-like space with a large menuboard packed with a substantial variety of linked options, this cash-only food counter seems a bit intimidating at first, but I gotta say that dissolved immediately when the guy running the counter (who I found out later was the owner) was incredibly nice and helpful. Seriously, huge points for the hospitality. After making your order, you can grab a seat and wait for your food to be brought out to you. I have to say, if you're looking for a juicy, tasty sausage of any type and you don't mind paying a slight premium for fresh and fanciful ingredients, this is the place for you. I got the duck sausage topped with foie gras, and man, oh man, the combo was so good, and the cheese fries my wife got with her sausage were great as well. My only issue with the joint has to be the fact that if you're in the mood for something simple like a hot dog or polish sausage, you'll be paying unneeded premium. I thought my foie gras duck sausage was right on point in terms of price, but my wife's sister just got a Chicago-style dog and it was a bit too pricey for what was essentially a good hot dog (of which you can find in many places for much less). Still, I cannot fault the hype for this place, as it is a fantastic experience if you're looking for a sausage with a little extra sumthin' sumthin' (get your mind out of the gutter)."
1373,"A totally awesome and unique purveyor of sausage. The complete name of this place is Hot Doug's Sausage and Encased Meat Emporium. The reputation of this place preceded itself even before a visit by Anthony Bourdain, but now, after that, the place is even more popular. If that's possible. We visited on a blisteringly sunny and cold March saturday, about 12.30pm. We waited in line, with everyone else, until about 2.15. Very few people left, and those that came understood that to experience the greatness, the wait was part of the experience. Now sure, everything tastes better when you have to wait for it. But honestly, this place would taste awesome without the wait. Doug's is truly a shrine to the encasement of meat. The three of us ordered about 10 sausages with several types of meat: beef, chicken, bison, lamb, and pork by my count. We also had the duck fat french fries. So that's 6 types of animal product in one meal. I dare you to find that in a meal anywhere else. Seriously, it's something that may not be accomplished again in my life.. All of the sausages, particularly the more exotic types, were excellent. I had a rib-eye steak sausage with horshradish that really did blow me away. The duck fat french fries, not so much. For all it's greatness though, Doug's can't get 5 stars from me. The reason is simple. Amidst all the extravagance, I got the basic hot italian sausage to try something ""classic"". In Chicago, you expect this to be top-notch, and it simply disappointed. The hot italian was not all that hot, the consistency inside was too fine, it lacked fennel seed (which is a debated ingredient, but I personally think it's necessary). Also, the mustards on-hand weren't particularly noticeable. Ultimately, this place is a trip. It's really, really, really, great. Do order the craziest encased meat you can find. It's sooo worth it. But if you're the Ultimate Encased Meat Emporium, you better have the most top-notch hot italian sausage I've ever eaten."
1374,"There's not much to add that hasn't been said about Hot Doug's. Super long line - be ready and willing to stand out in the sun, or at least have one friend willing to do so while you hide under a tree/shade (I saw one guy bring one of those camping chairs with him - genius). Cash only. Green River (yay!) and duck fat fries on Fri/Sat. I liked their regular fries as well. The foie gras dog gets all the publicity & is very tasty (and rich. SO RICH) but my favorite was the ribeye steak sausage w/Black Garlic Aioli & double creme brie. The black garlic aioli...oh my god. Just. wow. It's a wait, but it's worth it."
1375,"The in-laws had me and my husband curious about this place since they visit it monthly, so we grabbed the kids and off we went. I made my husband wait in line while I walked up and down the block with the kids. There was no way they were going to stand still for the 30 minute line. My daughter's first order of business was to visit the bathroom, of course. It was a bit hard to maneuver through the sea of patrons but we made it with no accidents. The ladies bathroom had a cute mural of American ""Hot Dog"" Gothic but it kinda freaked my daughter out. She didn't understand why they didn't have any eyes. Finally our turn came. Doug was there to take our order and make suggestions (like ordering a small soda since it came with free refills) so I got one of the ever changing sausage specials of Blue Cheese Pork with Pear Pure and Smoked Almonds . My husband got something with Foie Gras and a second sausage of ber Garlic Pork with Roasted Garlic Dijonnaise and Widmer Brick Cheese . The kids weren't willing to go gourmet so they got a regular Hot Dog and Corn Dog. Luckily we visited Hot Doug's on a Friday so we were able to order the Duck Fat Fries. The best thing was that they brought the food to us so I didn't have to wrangle the children while balancing the tray on my head like I usually do. Our lunch was a wonderful change from the ordinary and surprisingly I enjoyed the Foie Gras sausage the best. Now, I liked our visit but with the long lines and short attention span of the children I don't think I'll be visiting Doug's as much as I'd like to. Perhaps I'll drop them off at grandma's next time."
1376,"Honestly, someone needs to tell me why I've been missing out on Hot Doug's all this time. Was someone hiding it from me?! We did lunch there today-- 1:30ish on a Tuesday-- and there was a line out the door the entire time we were there. We did a corndog, the celebrity dog which was a cran-apple sausage with sage mayonnaise and a gouda-esque cheese, and the spicy chicken sausage with chipotle-ancho mayo. All three were stupendous. The corndog was honestly a revelation-- I couldn't believe how good a corndog could possibly be... The fries were yummy, the drinks good, and the dogs? YUM. All in a totally family-friendly environment that's kitschy without being lame. We'll definitely head back over there the next time we have out of town guests. A perfect Chicago restaurant that's easy on the wallet."
1377,"This was the first place we stopped to eat when we came to Chicago. I was worried because we arrived right at lunch time (12:30), but we didn't have to wait very long at all (about 20-30 minutes). I ordered two regular fries and Doug told me to just save money and get one large. Then I ordered a large drink and he told me to just get a small since they had free refills because he's ""not too big on upselling"". The food was really good, but I'm not sure I would have waited two hours for it."
1378,"The reputation of this place precedes itself--literally, personified by a snake-line embodied by a mass of humans extending down the sidewalk. I guess Doug must be a happy guy, who knows his limits and isn't impatient to get anywhere? The doors close at 4 p.m. on weekdays, officially leaving this place available only for tourists of sorts during the week, so I'd imagine most locals (and weekenders) are only able to get to this place on saturday. But I don't blame Doug--I mean, closing at four, he must leave the actual place at 5, maybe 6, after cleaning and that, so he just wants a normal 9-5 life while sponsoring the idea of great hot dogs on California. Down to the meatyness of the subject, I had the Elvis, and a cognac infused lamb and pork sausage with spinach and goat cheese. The Elvis was a regular dog I take, $2.50, very delicious, mostly normal, with a big pickle spreading itself on top, and the cognac infused goodness was definitely very tasty. You could taste each ingredient separately but still appreciated the dog as a whole, with the goat cheese chunks finishing off the top. I also enjoyed duck fries, which were different, crunchy and tasty. If anything, this place is worth the visit for the mere experience--once you get in, you're sure to have a place to sit, somehow. I do need to admit that I need to go there again to be fully satisfied--although tasty, my hot dogs were not large in size, were done in 3-4 bites. They didn't leave me with the impression of magnificence and I wouldn't say they are the best dogs I'll ever taste. Either way, snake yourself to the line on a good saturday and it's sure to kick off the weekend in a dog way."
1379,"Awesome! I don't even like hot dogs but I LOVE them here!!! The line was long, all the way down the street, but man was it worth it. We probably waited 20 minutes, but I didn't even care !! I never thought I would be this excited over a hot dog, go figure. It just tastes great ! I got the Kiera Knightley, which is a fire dog, with everything, just right and spicy ;) ! You'll wait a while but trust me you won't care either. Everyone that works there is super nice, and so is Doug. The chairs are comfy. The fries are yummy, they're the kind with the skin on them. Be careful of the sport peppers, they're extra hot. Oh and it is cash only."
1380,"I'm just going to say it as absolutely simple as possible: one of Doug's hot dogs almost made me cry at first bite. It was so, so, so good. I can't remember the name but it was the pork & shrimp sausage with the gouda cheese, almonds, and creme fraische on top. Yes, it is a long wait, and yes it is worth it. Yes it's in the middle of nowhere, but that's the only thing keeping the lines barely manageable. I've stood outside in the middle of December and haven't been disappointed. I like the fact that Doug is the guy who takes your order. I like the fact that everyone who works there seems to be pretty down to earth. Any negatives? I think the duck fat fries are good, but a tad overrated."
1381,"We disregarded good advice and slept in on the Saturday we were to visit Hot Doug's. We took the bus down Addison to California and walked the rest of the way. You could see the line all the way from the bus stop (3 blocks away). We weathered rain, wind, boring nerdy hiptster convo about Star Wars and other meat-themed restaurants for 2 hours, but we were on a mission. This was an adventure we had planned for. My boyfriend's a trainer so he had planned to make full use of his professional appetite. This enabled me to sample several dogs: The Chicago Traditional (a classic favorite), Atomic Bomb (I managed one bite- it was stuffed with jalipenos!), Rosemary Chicken (my favorite of the group, savory in true sausage form, the cheese was perfect), The Teuben (tasted exactly like a reuben- so good), Thai Chicken (my BF's fave, but I was grossed by the seaweed- it ain't natural on a dog), and of course, the infamous Duck Fat Fries (good but not so good I need to write home about it). After 2 hours of anticipation, I can say that we weren't disappointed. They had a wide selection of sodas, the decor was amusing and we managed seats on the stools facing the outside window so we got to watch the line. I will confess, I'm vegetarian for 99% of the week and Hot Doug's was a treat I'll allow myself vary rarely, if ever again. My lack of 5 stars was the hours. I'll even brave the wait if Doug's was open for dinner. Alas, they are not. So, they get my measly 4 stars. Definitely go at least once, but don't expect the speediest or classiest of meals. Just great eats."
1382,"I won't waste time repeating what's already been overstated on the dozens of positive reviews. Amazing selection of encased meats, and one of the best hot dogs you'll ever have...and worth the 30-40 minute weekend wait (even in the cold). One word of warning about the duck fat fries, though -- if you're not used to such a lardy dish you may want to take a precautionary Zantac..."
1383,"I will preface this by saying, I am normally a pretty healthy eater... This is probably the worst food on earth for you in terms of nutrition. But, when you got to have meat, this is your place. I had the game of the week when I went, which was an elk, venison, buffalo and antelope sausage smothered in a cherry brandy sauce and topped off with chunks of blue cheese. It was by far the best sausage I have every had--hands down. The duck-fat fries will probably take a few years off my life in the end, but it was worth it. Yes, the line sucked; yes, the hours are a bit restrictive. Do I care? No!"
1384,I was def. impressed by this place; had a chance to check it out 2 weeks ago. Wow on the line too!! Can't believe how many people were there. anyways enough about the line; seems like a line will always be there on a weekend. So be prepared for that. The gourmet toppings on the sausages are ridiculous; excellent quality and they know what works with what! simply put the wait in line is def. worth the trip. To avoid the line go early; way before they open!!
1385,"Wow. Hot Doug's is fast approaching 1000 reviews and he is maintaining 4.5 stars. I think that is about all the encouragement you need, right? This joint serves up the greatest hot dogs and sausages anyone has ever had. Feeling conservative? Just go with a dog and you'll be happy. Feeling more adventurous? Maybe you should try out an ostrich or rattlesnake sausage...whatever is on the ""game of the week""! If you're there on a Saturday I recommend going with the duck fat fries. They're worth the extra coin. Even if this weren't the greatest hot dog joint in the world I think Doug's smiling face and positive attitude would be reason enough to go back again and again and again."
1386,"Yes, HD's is delish. Yes, its always crowded and there's a line around the block. Yes, most of the patrons are now tourists (therefore annoying). Yes, its worth the extra cash and the trek from the West Loop. But after only two trips (one Pre-Bourdain and one Post-Bourdain), I don't think I'll be going back until it looses popularity....which isn't going to happen. Its just not worth the hassle!"
1387,"Wow, just wow. Despite the ridiculous line, even for a theme park ride, the food creations here at Hot Doug's are so sublime, that you forget all about it. Though I suppose you could consider what goes on at this otherwise ordinary street corner a ride through encased meat-land. It really is that impressive. Fortunately, I had the company of about 15 of my best friends to wait out the line, and descend upon Doug like the hungry maniacs we were. Thank goodness the food came out only 2-3 minutes after we each placed our orders. Many sausages and trays of duck fat fries later, our group of non-Chicagolanders could leave the city knowing that, if for no other reason, we'd have to come back to town again. Not that it hasn't been said, but the incredible and unique flavor and texture combinations that are the hallmark of Doug's encased meat creations must be tasted to be believed. My personal favorite, of the many I tried was the Atomic Ribeye, with a complex meaty taste, spicy back end, obscenely juicy texture, and lovely goat cheese topping. Unless you are a naziesque vegan, or cannot stand still in one place for more than a few moments, you owe it to yourself to eat at Hot Doug's, at least once. Yes, it will take up most of your morning or afternoon. Yes, if done properly, it will leave you so full you won't think about food for at least 24. But yes, it is a great food experience absolutely worth the trouble. Just bring a bunch of your friends, and you will leave better friends than ever. Hot Dogs? Schmot dogs."
1388,"My first thought was ""wow, this is the EXACT opposite of any new york institution where they rush you in and rush you out as soon as you get in."" There's a reason why Doug speaks to every customer about their days and the line moves at the speed it does. This system ensures every customer gets a seat to enjoy their dougs at their own pace; It's so nice that people aren't breathing down your back for your seats. My favorite is the Chicago dog, everything, with hot peppers. I was able to try the duck fat fries and the regular fries and I preferred the regular fries. there was a line on a monday at 11:00 am there was a line on a saturday at 10:30 am there will always be a line.. but grab a friend you havent seen in a while and chat up a storm. it's a great way to catch up and the time will go by that much faster. it's worth it."
1389,"Having gone to Lane Tech theres no way I havent heard of, or made it out to, Hot Dougs. But I am embarrassed to say I havent been there since high school before the kitchen fire. Better late than never again I guess. It was a great day off today without a doubt. Im glad I didnt sleep in today and made it out to hot dougs. We joined the line around 2:45, sat down with the food about an hour later. Mid seventies, early october afternoon in chicago..bring on the line. Of course I had to order the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with the Duck Fat Fries. And I added the Lamb and Beef Gyro. My friend ordered the first two as well and the Buffalo Sausage. We had shared the Gyro and Buffalo. Oh man..where to begin? The duck fat fries!! Crispy, clean..you thought bacon grease is amazing..duck fat puts her to shame. Bacon grease has to tip her hat and take a knee. Almost forgot..only available fridays and saturdays! Lamb and beef gyro...kalamata olive sauce, feta cheese! I love cheese..feta is definitely up there on my list. And these were huge chunks o cheese. I wasnt too much a fan of the kalamata olive sauce; it was good, dont get me wrong, but def not for me. I think onions and cilantro would have complimented and completed it well. Buffalo Sausage...Chipotle Dijonnaise and Smoked Gouda. Did I mention I love cheese? Because I love cheese! And smoked gouda has to be..top 3? That and the chipotle dijonnaise...what a creamy combo. No only was there chipotle in the dijonnaise but it was also in the buffalo sausage itself. Great little kick..buffalo was clean and not gamey whatsoever. Definitely a keeper. And finally, what could I say about Foie Gras that hasnt already been said? Letting it sit on the back of your tongue, its essence bounces in your mouth like an echo in a cave. And then it rises to your nose like smoke up a chimney. My palette definitely isnt mature enough quite yet to fully grasp such great culinary complexities. I could completely understand why this would be illegal."
1390,"This place is AWESOME, delicious, friendly, unique. However, it is VERY hard to get in these days. A year or two ago, there would be a line and you might need to wait 20 minutes to get through the door. Yesterday I went, and waited in line (going out the door and down a block) for 1 hour and 45 minutes before we could order. And this was at the end of the day, too! That said, the dogs were DELICIOUS as usual. If it's nice outside and you don't mind a looooong wait, you can get in and feast upon delectable encased meats."
1391,"It's the experience & the flavor that keeps you coming back for more! Doug is always calm & friendly when taking your order despite the seemingly endless line of hungry diners! (If you're impatient don't bother b/c you won't like the wait!) If you can work out the perfect strategy to line-up time you're all set, somewhere between your 1st hunger-pang & ravenous is the perfect time to saunter up! By the time you hit the counter, VIOLA! Today I tried the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage w/ truffle aioli, foie gras mousse & sel gris. If I had been paying attention I'd have asked them to nix the ""sel gris"" (white salt)- it was a bit too much for me! I dig their interesting take on the sausage! I'll be back.... PS: Mr. Doug Sir, ORDER MORE T-SHIRTS.... PLEASE!"
1392,"Ok, I wouldn't be a true Chicago girl if I wasn't into Hot Dougs. This place is the shit and everyone should go here at least once. It runs like clock work and they serve some premium dogs here (and there is always a spicy one on the menu for those who like it hot) Here are my only gripes: 1) You can get there early or late on a rainy day or on a cold day, doesn't matter --- you are GOING to wait. You are going to wait for at least 30min to an 1hr. It doesn't matter if in your head you say ""but no one will go today!"" no they will. there's a line forming right now, as we speak. 2) They need to post a menu outside because once inside I always have trouble deciding and then it's too late."
1393,"We went here just this afternoon, Thursday. We set off early hoping to beat the long queues which we've read so much about on Yelp. We got there at 12 noon. We were SOOOOO anxious that the queue would snake all the way around and our hungry stomachs would be screaming throughout our wait. Extremely fortunate were we! The queue was still within the doors of the restaurant! Yayyyyy! Ok, I wouldn't call it a restaurant because it's a small, unassuming place, tucked into the corner after a row of residential houses. We loved the deco - there were so many things hanging on the walls, cool pictures all over (even in the washroom!), very VERY colourful, even the chairs are of red, yellow, blue. The energy and activity that fills the place belies the size of it! Anyway, we ordered the foie gras dog (can't remember how much this was), the swedish potato Sausage with Dill-Garlic Mustard and Caraway Havarti ($7.50), and the cheese fries (large @ $2.75). My husband said his foie gras dog was not bad. I can't quite classify that ""not bad"" for you because I couldn't bring myself to eat the foie gras. Sorry, Yelpers! I can tell you re the Swedish potato Sausage though. The sausage was unbelievably soft and juicy inside. Usually when you eat hot dogs, they're tough and plain NOT nice. This swedish potato sausage had a PROPER taste! The hot dog bread was amazingly soft and hot, just soooooo pleasing in your mouth. The Dill-Garlic Mustard wasn't overpowering in taste because they didn't splatter it all over the hot dog as that would mask the taste of the cheese and sausage. I'd say the servings given for each accompanying ingredient for the hot dog was just perfect to compliment the sausage and bread. Cheese fries. They're good. There are different kinds of fries. Some people like the thin crispy, hardly any potato filling kind, some like it fat, filled with potato and soft. Hot Doug's fries are medium-sized, filled with a loose amount of potato meat, not very soft, not very sturdy to hold up straight and not very crispy - it's like everything in moderation. But when it's hot and with warm melted cheese...it's GooooooD. All in all, I would say that it's a great place. Good food, definitely much (x100) better than the normal hot dog. Excellent variety (more than 10 I think!). However, in all honesty, I do not think that I would wait for more than 1 hour for this."
1394,"So many dogs to choose from, and long lines. I had a polish and it tasted the same as other joints as the hot dougs. I didn't try the specials though. If you going here, avoid those 2 since you can get it anywhere. Downside is cash only and closes early. However, tax included"
1395,"Came here yearning for a primo place in Chicago for encased meats/sausages. I was not disappointed. Though the waiting 45 minutes in the freezing cold was a test of my limits, it was definitely worth the wait. Had the bacon and cheddar elk sausage with Guinness mustard and smoked gouda, the Elvis, and of course the duck fat fries. The sausages were the most unique and best tasting I've ever had. So much flavor in every bite. I tried a bit of the duck fat fries which were great as well but the portion was so huge I had to take them to-go. Hot Doug's is a definite must for me when I come back to Chicago. I'm hooked!"
1396,"Hot Damn! I couldn't say no to this place after seeing it on the Travel Channel with Anthony Bourdain. So what did I do? I dragged my Chicagoan friend out on a Saturday and said, ""we HAVE to go to this place"". After almost an hour-long commute from downtown, we finally find the place around 1pm and the line is relentless. We were starving already but we thought we'd tough it out because this place was supposed to be the best and we were semi-prepared having heard of the long waits before. Hunger went from waiting to impatience to craziness. At one point it started raining and we hoped people would just give up and leave the line... but nope. They stood there like soldiers, whipping out their umbrellas (they were ALL prepared) to shield themselves from the rain. Two hours and 15 minutes later, we arrived at the front of the line and our eyes being bigger than our stomachs (seriously, two extremely hungry girls are not a pretty sight) decided to order duck fat fries and 4 hot dogs. FOUR! (We usually can just eat 1 and we're golden.) A Paul Kelly, The Dog, a Smoked Debreziner, and the Antelope Sausage. Everything was pretty good minus the weird gaminess of the antelope... that was a little much for me but at least now I can say I've tried antelope! Wish the duck fat fries had more duck flavor, or just flavor period, but everything was still good enough to be devoured completely. Not a scrap left! Seriously--we ate more than some couples who at least had one guy to eat, and we were more than fat (or full to put it nicely) after our meal!"
1397,"Add me to the growing list of Doug Sohn's admirer's. I was told to go to this establishment in July, but I don't live nearby and the hours are such that it made it difficult to go. I finally got around to going there today, since I will be leaving Chicago soon and I needed to get one last Chicago-style hot dog and Hot Doug's was where I heard I should do it. Despite my many months of waiting and extremely high expectations, Hot Doug's met and exceeded all the lofty standards I had put forth in my head. The decor is just tacky enough to be wonderful. Celebrity pictures, a large timeline on the history of encased meats in Chicago, and other assorted eye candy hang on the walls, which are all bright colored. Everything in the place is brightly colored, from the fans to the HVAC vents (mostly in blue, yellow and red). The menu is very matter-of-factly presented with item listed (most going by celebrity names) and a brief description of what it is under the title. Next to that are a listing of the daily specials, which include any range of zoo animals ground up and served in natural encasements. Behind the counter, Doug himself takes the orders and just adds up the tab (tax is included in the price). Everything is very reasonably priced, even the gourmet meats. Now, while the inside of this eatery does not hide the fact that this is a hot dog joint, the food may give you pause for thought. This is high class food in an easy to handle package. The hotdogs are absolutely delicious and the toppings (onions, sweet relish, pickles, tomatoes, sport peppers, mustard, celery salt) are all incredibly tasty (the relish is some of the best in the city). The hot dogs themselves are great, with just the right amount of snap and a good bit of spice added to the meat to give it the perfect flavor. Piled high with all the trimmings, the Chicago-style dog, 'The Dog' is only a $1.50 and is amazing, best I've ever eaten. Other offerings are also phenomenal. I had the 'White Wine and Dijon Rabbit Sausage with Truffle Sauce Moutarde and Port Salut Cheese' in addition to 'The Dog.' Doesn't sound like fast food, eh? And for $6, you'd still think it is fast food, but it sure doesn't taste like it! The rabbit sausage was mild and flavorful with a cooked-over-a-wood-fire taste to it. The truffle sauce was also very good, with the truffle flavor complimenting the rabbit nicely and not overwhelming it. The port salut cheese was fantastic as well, a great soft cheese with a bit of bite, like Gorgonzola. One last recommendation is to get the duck fat fries. Best fries I have ever had. They smell fantastic and taste even better. Words can't describe how good these little sticks of potato are. My only complaints are the fact that the location is no where near me (and getting farther away since I am leaving the city), the hours are pretty poor if you don't live or work nearby, and there is always a line. Then again, for last part basically explains the first two complaints. This place is so good, it doesn't need to move or stay open any longer."
1398,"Oh, Hot Doug's. I'm always so excited at the prospect of visiting you, yet in the event that I can actually make it there during your limited hours of operation, the gi-normous line always makes me sad.. and a little angry. But I can't stay mad at you. One bite of your delicious, unique, salty sausages and I'm yours. Until we meet again..."
1399,"I think everything that can be said about Hot Doug's has been said. I'll just add that Doug is the nicest guy - he must really love what he does because he greets everyone with a smile. If you want to avoid the lines, try going on a weekday after 1:30 - my boyfriend and I do that whenever we are craving Hot Doug's and never have to wait."
1400,"So you ask yourself, ""Is two hours an obsurd amount of time to wait for a hot dog?"" The answer I gave the folks as I walked out, who asked me the same question, ""Absolutely NOT!"" The man friend and I took a cue from Lance Armstrong and embarked on a ""Tour-de-Chicago"", with half-time-hot-doug's in mind. After a slight error in directions on my part, we took our spots in the long line around 12:30...at approximately 1:30 I started second guessing and eyeing up the Popeye's down the road...at 1:45 everyone around us started with the tired and hungry fits of complaints...at 2:15 I was on the edge of the stoop trying to get a feel for if people enjoyed their dogs and rationalize the wait...at 2:30 we had three beautiful dogs, cherry cokes, duck fat fries, and huge grins on our faces!! The menu is overwhelming...people printed it out beforehand so they wouldn't hold up the line...we pulled it up on my phone countless times to come up with our plan of attack. I went with the pork with apple sausage topped with gouda and siracha mustard...three things I would've never put together, but tasted extremely gouda on the bun!! My man friend opted for a jalepeno dog with pepper jack cheese and an original hot dog with chili, cheese and carmelized onions...this one was ol' faithful and won for the best! Don't even get me started on the duck fat fries!!!! Whoa...party party in ya mouth!! We had nothing left on our table except for some chili-filled napkins when we were done. Let's just say the rest of the bike ride had us moving at a slower pace....but Hot Doug's was well worth the wait!!!"
1401,Once upon a time I did my photo final on Hot Doug's. http://www.flickr.com/ph
1402,My boyfriend saw Hot Doug's on TV (news) so we decided to go and check it out. Do not go on too empty of a stomach because this place is extremely popular. We waited in line for over an hour before placing our order. I can't remember what we ordered since by that time we thought we could eat the entire store so we ordered a little of everything. These hot dogs were the biggest I've ever seen! Each and every hot dog has its own unique flavor and we enjoyed them very much. Tip - closed on Sundays!
1403,I recruited 3 of my diehard south side co-workers to make the forbidden drive up north to come here by 4:30 pm for the duck fat fries and a hot dog. Mission accomplished. (NORTH SIDE!!!!!!!!!!)
1404,"H is for Hot Doug's, that's good enough for me H is for Hot Doug's, that's good enough for me H is for Hot Doug's, that's good enough for me Hot Doug's, Hot Doug's, Hot Doug's starts with H. If the Cookie Monster had been to Hot Doug's, he'd ditch the cookies and sing about the awesomeness served at 3324 N California Ave. I returned to Hot Doug's, again with David R, on another cold wet day. And again, left in a coma induced by some of the most delicious food Chicago has to offer. Keeping some form of tradition, I ordered the Chicago dog and split an order of duck fat fries. Both as yummy as my first visit, leaving me wonder ""why did it take me 10 months for a return visit?"" I also ordered the Apple Pork Sausage with mustard curry and creamy melted gouda. In a word - yummmm. The service, as usual, was outstanding and worth every minute/hour of waiting. Doug, don't worry. I won't let 10 months pass again."
1405,The specialty sausages: prime. Duck fat-fried fries: groovy. The lines (even at 4PM on a cold and rainy Saturday): not so much.
1406,"I came, I had a veggie dog, and my life was changed! I have been trying to get to Hot Doug's for months and finally made it. Best veggie dog I've EVER had (topped with mustard and caramelized onions). While most store-bought veggie dogs tend to leave me underwhelmed, the Pete Shelley did me right. Their regular fries are pretty damn good too--the perfect combination of a crispy outside and fluffy inside. Veggie dog, black cherry pop, and fries = $5.25 I'll be baaaack."
1407,"CASH ONLY!!! Don't wait in line and then realize you can't pay with a credit card! I came on a sunny but very chilly Saturday with 3 other people...and waited in line outside for 1.5 hours for a hot dog!!! We were waiting at such an awkward time too - after lunch and before dinner - and it was still so busy. We got there about 45 minutes before ""closing time"" -- but if you are standing in line before closing time, then you can still wait your little heart out until you finally get inside. So they don't just close the doors on you just because you didn't make it in. We weren't sure about this, so when we asked everyone around us - everyone else also seemed to be first timers also! Where are all the regulars? They were probably smart enough to come at other times when they don't have to wait so long! So...I spent $28 dollars on HOT DOGS. Seriously! My bf and I ordered two hot dogs each (so three specialty dogs and one regular), a soda, and the delicious duck fat frites. And our friends also each ordered two hot dogs each - so we split ALL the hot dogs so we could really try the variety of everything. Was it worth the wait? Not in my opinion. But it was fun trying these crazy types of hot dogs, but when it came down to it - I liked the ""regular"" hot dog a whole lot better than any of the other specialty hot dogs. And these are definitely very filling - very surprisingly, we were all STUFFED after eating our own share of 2 hot dogs and the fries - and I'm talking about 3 big guys who can eat plus myself. Would I come again? Well...maybe - but not if I had to wait. The duck fat frites are definitely the best part - so come on a Friday or Saturday. But I'm really glad I came - there is so much hype about this place that I just had to try it for myself. Plus the owner himself, Doug! is at the front counter - he is SO NICE and SO very helpful. Plus he does all the cashier calculations in his head! I'm happy his business is successful because he just seems like such a nice guy."
1408,GREATEST encased meats you will EVER eat. Went on Monday and the line was just out the door. Wait was still about 30 minutes but well worth it! I always let my bf order b/c he's the greatest. He ordered us a Beer and Cheddar Cheese Bison Sausage with Dark Beer Mustard and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese and a cognac infused lamb sausage with manchego cheese. We also split a corn dog (b/c the man loves 'em) and fries. Delicisousness!! HEAVEN!
1409,It is what it is. A good hot dog place. Owner was very cordial and polite. Food tasted great. Better than places in my home town.
1410,"Look, forget about the line. It's a fact of the restaurant. All the best novelty food places should have a wait...how else would you know you were going somewhere good? Line aside, this is the only place I will go and eat $20 worth of sausages in one sitting. It's too hard to pick just one from the list, and beside, you spend all that time thinking about what you're going to get while waiting, and you don't want to back down. The duck fat fries are awesome, the bratwurst is maybe the best bratwurst I've ever had in my life, and the spicy pork sausage with gouda (one of the fairly regular specials) is to die for."
1411,"I saw something a couple weeks ago that sums up the awesomeness of Hot Doug's. A guy came out of Hot Doug's and just threw up everywhere. Of course, that doesn't sound good, but the reason why he threw up (as his friend explained to the people watching him vomit) was because he WANTED TO CLEAR UP SPACE SO HE COULD GO BACK AN EAT MORE! Sure enough, after throwing up the guy went and got back into line, ready to eat more dogs. Hot Doug's is so good, it's the one place where it's totally cool to be bulimic."
1412,"We had to rent a car to get there and it was definitely worth it. We got there before it opened and there was already a line down the block. Doug himself greeted us at the counter and schmoozed us before he took our order. He even took a shot at my boyfriend for wearing a Mets cap. We ordered off the specials menu mostly. It was last July and my fondest memory was of the sirloin dog. It had those crunch onions on top and was beefy delicious. We also had some greek dog with olives and feta. The Dog was also great. I believe we went on a non duck fat fries day so we ordered the cheese fries instead. I must say, I'm not a fan of excessive use of cheese, but these were damn good. The cheese was more creamy than cheesy. I will be returning this July for the Taste of Chicago. Hot Dougs is not one of the venders, so I will be once again renting a car to sample the specials menu."
1413,"Everything you read about this place is true --- long lines, good food, great place. On a busy day, you will wait a half-hour plus! I suggest you bring a game or something while you are in line. It will help make the time pass by more quickly. I played ""What's in my pocket?"" with my friend. Wait, that sounds dirty...it wasn't. They have veggie options -- which is nice. And their fries are DELISH, y'all. Get 'em with the cheese -- you'll thank me later. Be warned though - CASH ONLY. And no cash machine in sight. It's 2010, Doug --- time for a credit card machine."
1414,"Although I had to wait half an hour for my sausage, it was well worth it. I had the mushroom and Swiss cheese pork sausage with chili-garlic mustard, ""ducky"" shiitake mushrooms and Esrom cheese. The sausage was perfectly cooked, full of flavor with shades of red wine. The Esrom cheese, a bit sour, is something I would never eat on its on. It complements the strong flavors of the sausage quite well, however. The interior was a bit packed, and I had to sit on a stool by the window. With the business they are getting, I feel that they should upgrade the space. Nonetheless, I will have to come back to try duck sausage with foie gras and intriguing duck fat fries."
1415,"How in the world it took me this long to go here is beyond me. This place is hands down the best hot dogs and fries. The atmosphere is pretty much awesome. How can you go wrong with great food, fun/retro/kitschy decor, and the owner taking your order? And seriously, the food is good. The ingredients are of excellent quality (not always true for hot dogs...). If you have yet to venture out to Hot Doug's- go. go now. And make sure you have cash with you."
1416,"Hot Doug's is one of the things that makes life beautiful. They serve hot dogs and gourmet hot dogs in just about any imaginable form they come. The chef there is very creative and the restaurant is clearly the work of his passion: encased meats. It's small, in a desolate location, and there is always a line. Even when it's cold, people stand outside to eat these links. The seating is ample and turns over quickly. The place is decorated in red, yellow and blue with Hot Dog memorabilia covering the walls. The regular menu includes a good set of basics which can be dressed up or down. There's a Chicago style hot dog, bratwurst, thuringers, spicy links, corn dogs, veggie dogs, chicken sausages, the list goes on and on. The fries are very good, and on Fridays and Saturdays they offer duck fat fries. There are specialty sodas and fountain drinks available. They have daily specials, including a game special. Sometimes, it's a bison link, sometimes rattlesnake. And the toppings are perfectly coordinated to match the meat selection. My favorites so far have been the game special Bison hot dog with whatever heavenly toppings he recommended that day and the Sante Fe style chicken sausage with brown mustard, tomatoes and carmelized onions. My boyfriend likes the occasional pork hot link special, with coca-cola bbq sauce, the thurginer and the brat. The only drawbacks to the place, which are perfectly forgivable since the food is so good, are the long lines, that it's cash-only, and that it's hard to get to if you've got a 9-5 job. Hot Doug's hours are tight. Whenever I ever get a weekday off, I try to go and gorge myself silly."
1417,"A+++. Doug Sohn is a genius, plain and simple, and a good-natured one at that. Gee, why not take your Kendall College culinary degree and create a restaurant that serves delicious and often eclectic sausages for prices not much greater than McDonalds? With that in mind, you need only experience the duck-fat fries and accompanying line once. Sure, they're awesome, but come on a weekday if you have that kind of time; the fresh-cut fries are just as good, and you get a serious mess of them for $2 and not much wait. The only possible complaints about this place are, well, the Saturday afternoon line and the short business hours. Then again, if Doug can make a place go by only being open six hours a day, six days a week, more power to him!"
1418,"Heaven on earth. I've made hour-and-a-half long commutes to wait in line for twenty minutes and it's so incredibly worth it. I'm always a fan of owner-diner interaction, and Doug stands front and center, taking orders and mixing it up with the guests. Over the years, I've managed to introduce Hot Doug's to dozens of my friends, and I've never had a single complaint. Great sausages, great decor, and a consistently updated website with their amazing specials. Oh, and the best testament to the place: I bought a T-shirt."
1419,"Doug's food is great. The regular dogs, veggie dogs, sausages, corn dogs, etc are some of the best in the city. But don't go to Doug's just for those. His specialty sausages are where it's at. I myself am not a fussy-foodie, so I haven't tried many of these. But the few that I have (including the glorious ""Teuben"" or reuben in sausage form) are fantastic. Doug has a great sense for creating innovative flavor combinations. However...the crowds. The lines are often times just ridiculous...stop by on a Friday or Saturday if you don't believe me. And then the place is so small, which means finding a table can be a real problem. I'd say it comes down to this: if you want to try some of Doug's delicious, unique experiments in encased meats, it's definitely worth the trip...just be prepared to wait. But if you are just going for the dogs and fries, I'd go elsewhere. Who wants to wait in 30 minute lines for hot dogs. Wiener's Circle, Duk's and especially Superdawg are are a few of my faves."
1420,"After waiting two hours for a sausage, I expected to leave Hot Doug's in a state of gustatory ecstasy. Yes the Ubergarlic was delicious, but not in an otherworldly oh-my-god-I'm-in-heaven sort of way. The duck fat fries were a greasy, salty mess; fine if you like that stuff but there are plenty of other places in this city to satisfy that lust. I also found it hard to fork over $8-9 on a single ""gourmet"" dog when you could walk out with a half dozen of the ""plain"" ones for the same price. I'm sure it's the premise of a gourmet dog that will attract most customers here, and the menu is certainly interesting, but don't expect these sausages to change your outlook on life. I also wonder if the exorbitant wait time skews perceptions of these dogs: what doesn't taste good after you've been hungrily waiting in line for 2 hours? If you must check it out, bring something to help kill the time, and beware of the ice cream man who parks next to the line and plays his siren song of ""Turkey in the Straw,"" ruining the appetites of those too weak to wait it out."
1421,"I wasn't that impressed. I mean I am a lover of all encased meats, but sometimes it just seems like more is not better. The duck fat fries were good, but didn't seem like they were that spectacular. One thing that is great is Doug. He's awesome. He's friendly, he's great at giving suggestions and he's just pleasant to deal with. I am sure that I'll be back and try something else, maybe I just ordered wrong, but I think the line is keeping me away."
1422,"The funny thing about this place is that the line makes the experience THAT much better. Look at the starved faces around you...with people pressing their faces into the glass windows to see inside. As you inch closer, you see an opening to step inside. Finally getting up to order is like totally a Harold and Kumar moment. This place is amazingly creative and unique! Definitely check the menu out while you're waiting in the line that usually wraps around outside. I got the duck hot dog with the foie gras mousse on top with some sort of Dijon mustard and something truffle. The hot dog itself was great, but to be honest besides the novelty, foie gras mousse is a little too heavy for a hot dog. But, I LOVE the different options offered here, and the menu choices always make my mouth water. I tried my friend's kangaroo hot dog with passionfruit relish (yum!) as well as like a mountain game mix hot dog which was also flavorful. So great options for those who love creative and aren't afraid of trying something new. And okay normally, I'm a huge fan of duck fat haha.. I love French duck confit and stuff, but the duck fat fries were just ultra greasy normal fries. And I didn't detect any flavor difference besides grease. So I would skip these because they just made me feel sick after. Definitely try out this glorious hotdog emporium... I can quickly foresee this place becoming a serious addiction."
1423,"I'm not the most active man, so going to Hot Doug's was like running a marathon. I've always thought about doing it but it's an intense process that truly requires some preparation. For starters there's the location. It's not near any good public transportation. So you'll either have to drive or head out at 9:00am. Secondly there's the dreaded line everyone talks about. ""How long can it be?"" you think. Believe me, it's long. I had my doubts at first. I questioned could it be worth the wait. After 30 minutes in line, you're in for the long haul. I couldn't wait that long just to leave. As we edged closer an ice cream truck appears almost like a mirage. This definitely made the wait more bearable and gave me a second wind. As you enter, the smell of grilled meats hits your nostrils and the salivation begins. I sampled four dogs that day (two for myself and two for my fiancee). You would think two hot dogs would be a breeze, but you would be wrong my friend. I could barely walk as I was leaving the place. The four I tried were the Kira Knightly (a spicy hot dog that was great), the cognac infused lamb/pork (nice but nothing amazing), the bacon and cheddar elk (very good), and the duck frois gois (I almost pulled a scene from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and shot the cook as it was too good). The duck fat fries taste no different than regular fries, so I suggest getting the tater tots as they're more fun and have more crunch. In the end, the food was so outstanding I completely forgot about the 2.5 hour wait it took to get inside. Maybe it'll be better in the winter..."
1424,"Hot Doug's has the best encased meats I can remember. Try everything here, it's good! I think they only have them Saturday so you have to come at least once on Saturday and try the duck fat fries, yum. Line gets pretty ridiculous, but you can call ahead. This place makes me miss Chicago."
1425,"Me and Amisha S. came here on a Friday afternoon at around 3pm. I was surprised that there was a line wrapped around the building at this time of day. I'd see the lines shown on ""No Reservations"" but figured it was just the lunch time rush. On, the bright side you get to smell the intoxicating duck fat fries wafting from the front door as people slowly get to enter. After waiting a little over an hour, we got to the friendly Doug at the counter who helped us order. I will admit was a bit overwhelmed by all the tube meat choices and didn't want to make a bad choice after all the opportunity cost involved. We ordered the Keira Knightly, The Dog (w/ chili & cheese), an Irish banger special, and the duck fries! I now realize Irish bangers are too bland for my taste, but everything else was yummy. I'd like to come back if I was in town again to try more offerings, but would not be willing to wait 1+ hrs again. Maybe its not as bad on the days duck fries are not available? 3.5 stars for me!"
1426,"Yes, I have fallen prey to the wonder that is Travel Channel. This place is a plethora of meat in intestinal casings! I love duck and I love foie gras so thankfully they had a creation to fulfill my needs. One subway ride + one bus ride later, I arrive to a line about the length and duration of space mountain at Disneyland. I can't wait to see what awaits me inside. After mingling with some of the locals, they told me the duck fat fries is a must try. I take note of the advice and order my duck sausage + foie gras and a side of duck fat fries. I take a seat at the counter facing outside the establishment and wait for my order to come. I waste no time shoveling food into my foodhole, I was waiting in line for 2 hours and time is of the essense. I took a bite of the duck sausage with a good helping of foie gras, my mouth was overwhelmed with fatty flavor... mmmm.... within 3 bites my hot dog was gone.. aw. The size was a little small for a 8 dollar dog. The duck fat fries were ok. The first couple of bites was wow, but the novelty soon wore off. I recommend this place if you're nearby and check out kuma's korner if you're on a foodie run, it's just down the street."
1427,"This was the first stop after our flight, we didn't even stop at our hotel (but then again we did arrive around 11 and check-in wasn't until 3). The line didn't look too bad at first glance and it did move fairly steadily... we were in within 40 minutes of waiting. There were 4 of us, so we ordered the following and shared it all: From the regular menu: The Dog -- Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the trimmings (fried) The Marty Allen -- beef, pork and garlic Duck Fat Fries From the specials menu: Antelope Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Cream Sauce and Chevre du Poitou Cheese Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Black Mountain Garlic-White Wine Cheese I absolutely HATED the antelope. It was gamey and just left a really ""stinky"" after taste in my mouth... and the cheese?! How can you put something so gross on an already disgusting meat, ugh. Thinking about it makes me want to vomit. The duck and foie gras was soooooo good. If I had to choose one to get seconds, I'd totally choose this one. Although a little too abundant on the foie gras (but who can complain?) I totally enjoyed the savory taste of the duck. All the others were just okay... especially the Chicago dog. I was NOT impressed. I will take Nathan's from Coney Island over a Chicago dog anyday, hands down! Hot Doug's is located in a somewhat shady neighborhood, so I wouldn't feel safe walking around here late at night... although that could just be my cautious New Yorker instincts taking over. There is parking and also a bus on the corner that will take you directly to the CTA."
1428,"One more five-star review for the pile. Hot Doug's takes the familiar Vienna Beef store and turns it into an orgy of encased meats. The line is intimidating, but it moves pretty swiftly and is well worth the half hour you'll probably wait in it. If you go with a friend, then you should each order two different dogs and split them. Also, add on a corn dog. They go down smooth."
1429,"My first time in Chicago and my friend recommended this restaurant to me (Because you can't come to Chicago without getting hot dogs, right???). It was an awesome experience. I'm not really a hot dog person, but these were GOOOOOD. I got duck fat fries, 'The Dog' (normal Chicago dog w/all the toppings), and the cognac-infused lamb hot dog. Duck fat fries were fucking AMAZING. They were very crispy, which I LOVE. Their taste was very rich but I couldn't tell any duck taste or anything, haha. They were a bit pricy but so worth it. 'The dog' was good---I love their buns, so soft and delicious. It was okay, but I don't like pickles so that probably negatively influenced my appreciation of the hot dog. The lamb dog was AMAZING. It was slightly sweet, but had a very sharp/salty sort of cheese and the lamb was delicious. Everything balanced out perfectly. We came on a Friday (hence the duck fat fries were available) in the afternoon at about 2:45 or so, and we were in by a little past 3. The wait wasn't bad at all, especially after we got out of the cold and into the warm restaurant. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, everyone here was super nice and we made lots of friends in line that we ended up sitting with to eat! (: It is cash only, which we didn't know (luckily we had plenty of cash on us). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place, it's delicious. I'll for sure come back here if I'm in Chicago again."
1430,"Encased Meats......yummmmm. How have I not reviewed this place yet?! I know I have said this a couple of times before but this place deserves my review! You know those places you used to see on sitcoms? The ones where it is packed and and everyone gets excited about going to it? The ones that are such an iconic institution of the city that it would be a shame not to experience the food? Well, Hot Doug's is definitely that place! If you like meat, and I know you do, then go here for some tasty exotic dishes. Alligator was my last choice of sausage. If you aren't that adventurous, then try one of the many different styles of regular dogs. Whatever your desire, get there and enjoy!"
1431,This place it is insane. $ stars only because the location .and because it is cash only Great selections!
1432,"Yes, yes, greatest hot dog in Chicago, wide variety of encased meats with exotic toppings, etc. If you're reading this review, you know that already. The customer service here is definitely worth Yelping about. Given this place's insane popularity and its hole-in-the-wall location, I expected the owner to be a surly Soup Nazi, whipping people through orders with terse frustration. But Doug greeted every customer with a simple, sincere joy. He was genuinely happy that we showed up. Protip: get there at 10:50 AM. You'll miss the crowds who line up right when it opens (at 10:30) and beat the lunch rush."
1433,"We went here after I flew in on a Friday afternoon. Luckily it must have been a slow Friday afternoon because we waited in line for no more than 30 minutes or so. Luckily there was plenty to look at while waiting in line; from the people driving by asking ""are y'all really waiting in line for dat? Is it dat guud?"" to all the kitschy wiener-related decorations in the place. My favorite had to be the boys/girls bathroom signs. Boys get a hot dog in a bun, girls just get a bun. If you can't figure out with door to go in, that's your own fault. I ordered a standard Chicago Dog and a corn dog, along with the duck fat fries. I wouldn't say the duck fat fries are a reason enough to eat here, but they're pretty good, I guess. I didn't find that there was too much of a difference between them and regular fries. I'm sure some people would disagree but I wasn't terribly impressed. I was however impressed at how delicious and crunchy my corn dog was. The Chicago dog was delightful, the meat was tasty and all the toppings including the blinding-ly bright green relish were perfect. The constant flow of in and out traffic made seats available at all times. You wait in line, you order, you sit, you eat, and you get out. It's very simple. I'm not sure exactly what happened at 4pm, but there were definitely still a handful of people in line and I THINK they went to check who was last in line AT 4pm and once that person was inside the door they put a sign up behind him/her and cut off the rest of the line. They're very strict about their closing time which I think is OK. If you don't get there early enough it's your own fault for missing out. Hot Doug's is a definite must-try when visiting Chicago."
1434,"Be ready for a long wait. Also realize they close at 4:30 (not sure if they have someone that cuts off the line or what). They are also closed on Sunday. It's pretty cool they have duck fat fries, they are good but not the best fries you will every have, and you can only get them on Friday and Sat. Every dog I have had is amazing! Doug is really nice and seems more then happy to help you pick out a dog even after you have been standing by the menu for ten minutes. You have to make a visit, but be ready to spend a couple hours."
1435,"Okay, maybe it is worth waiting 2 hours in the cold for the duck fat fries on a weekend day and the foie gras which was out-of-control deliciousness. Side note: the alligator was not that great."
1436,"Hurray for Hot Doug's! I love that you can buy so many different types of hot dogs and sausages, and they have such great weekly specials! I finally got a chance to get over there and ordered a Wild Rice Chicken Sausage with yellow pepper sauce and some sort of cheese (I forgot which kind, but it was FANCY!). DELICIOUS! And there was a bit of a wait, but the line wasn't as long as I expected it to be when we go there. I think if you go earlier in the day on a weekend you'll get in pretty quickly. My only complaint is that it is so small inside so it's better to just get your dogs to go. But that's part of the charm of it being a little hole in the wall place, I guess! The guy behind the counter is so friendly and really seems to enjoy his job. He chatted with the people in front of us about some of the different choices, and I thought it was great that he didn't try to rush them along. I just don't get those places where it's their ""thing"" to be ultra-rude to you. Give me Hot Doug's anyday!"
1437,"Best hot dog joint in Chicago. I'd even venture to say that it's the best hot dog joint in the nation. I know I haven't been to every single hot dog joint in the nation, but I'd put my money on Hot Doug's. Classic hot dogs, specialty hot dogs, duck fat fries are all amazing. Doug is the owner and he's a nice guy, too. He's the one taking orders all day, at least he's always been the one when I've been there. Pros: A lot Cons: Only thing is the wait. You'll be lucky if you're not standing outside of the building at the end of the line. Even if you go at 11AM, it's likely to be out the door already. I've been here several times and each time I had to wait outside. It does move pretty quickly, though. From the time you reach the door, it takes maybe 10-20 minutes to order."
1438,"This place is perfect in every way. I would like to highlight the cheese fries here since I really haven't seen anyone give them the props they deserve: These fries are a package of melty, cheesy, fried goodness. It really is hard to find the perfect cheese fry in this city and these are absolute perfection. BTW they are fresh cut fries so you can imagine how they have the perfect combo of crunch and softness in every bite. Also, on Friday and Saturday you can do the duck fat fries with cheese... oh my gosh!"
1439,"I appreciate the great pride each staffer and owner takes in this place. Quality, unique products. Extremely tasty. My fave is the chicken/spinach sausage with some sort of sinfully yummy cheese chunks and sauce. Mmmm. Love the fun names of the food. If you don't want a long wait, try to make it there on a weekday, where services is speedy and you'll get a seat. They REALLY should consider rearranging their hours for more weekend business. I cannot take my out of town visitors there for a delightful treat because the lines are just too long on Saturday and they're closed Sunday."
1440,"Finally went to Hot Dougs after months of anticipation and a drive-by a few weeks ago when we decided the line was too long and we were too hungry to wait. Went this past Sat, showed up at 11:30am and the line was twice as long as what we had previously witnessed! Nevertheless, we were determined to stick it out. It was exactly 2 hours from the time we got in line to the time the dogs were in my mouth. 2 HOURS!!! I wouldn't wait that long for anything else (like a burger at Kuma's) but Dougs Dogs are unique, hence worth the wait for this experience. We had the rattlesnake dog (FAVE), foie gras/duck sausage dog (WORST, almost wanted to spit it out!), smoked debreziner (small red sausage that was really tasty with the toppings) and a corndog (best i ever had). Also the much acclaimed duck fat fries which were 100% disappointing! DO NOT waste your time in line on a Fri/Sat just to try these fries, it is NOT worth it! McDonalds has better fries! Seriously, they weren't even salty and had no flavor, they were just maybe a little crispier than other fries. Nothing special at all. However, I didn't want to waste stomach space on fries anyway since we had 4 dogs between 2 people, so I was fine without them!! Hard to choose from all the specialty dogs, wanted to try them all. If I ever go again, will go with a larger group so can sample more dogs. I doubt I'll make it to Hot Dougs more than once a year just cuz of the crazy wait involved, but it is definitely worth going to check it out even just once. PS: they ONLY ACCEPT CASH. i don't know if this is common knowledge, but i surely didn't know...good thing my bf always has cash on hand! There is no ATM around so you'd be screwed after waiting in line for hours if you weren't prepared."
1441,"1) CLOSED ON SUNDAYS 2) DUCK FAT FRIES ONLY SERVED FRI & SAT. Why? Why wasn't this the first thing EVERY yelper said?! Would've saved us so much heartbreak. That said- delicious, get two dogs, prepare to wait outside in the cold at LEAST 30 minutes, Doug is real friendly, sausages come out pretty quick. I HIGHLY recommend the Mushroom and Swiss Cheese; a regular told us to get the elk sausage, the saucisson was delicious but pretty mild. Happy visiting!"
1442,"If I wasnt afraid of gaining a ton of weight I'd drive out of my way three times a day for this place. Seriously, its that impressive. The decor is adorable (I collect hot dog memorabilia so I was in heaven). I visited Doug's for the first time the other day, the line was inside (amazing!) so I had to stop. I ordered the Elk and fries. Best. Fries. Ever. Oh and the dog? Freaking amazing! I'll be back for sure. Thanks Doug!"
1443,"Hot dogs are hot dogs. I am so glad I didn't have to wait in line for their dogs because if I were, I would have been pissed! I mean their signature hot dogs were good, but not something to wait in line for an hour or more for. I have tried it once and that is good enough for me."
1444,"I'll admit that i've waited in line at hot doug's...a few times... and i'll admit that it was worth it...every time.. Being that i am a vegetarian, I ate several veggie corn dogs. Really do not agree with the kangaroo meat...or how excited people got over it. sick. duck fat fries? uuuuuuuuuugh. BUT....doug is a gem, and he is always there to greet you. great service every time, consistant, and fun atmosphere. let's love hot doug's one and all."
1445,"I Traveled from Cleveland, Ohio to come to Hot Doug's I seen this unique place on No reservations. I made mistake. I tried to just up and go to hot dougs thinking that I can just drop in and get me a hot dog and leave. So Cleveland is a Hr behind so I looked at the Chicago clock I realized I should just leave my hotel and GPS.my way there.. Nada.. I didn't know I used my yelp to figure out what time they closed and to my Surprise 4pm!!!! I rushed there I got there and turned down the street and there it was I made a left on West roscoe and to my Surprise there was a line 3:58p Friday mind you. I parked and walked in line I was behind a kid that had a Hot Dougs T on he turned to me and told me the three hurtful words... Sorry were closed..:(... I made it my determination to come back it was labor day weekend so they would be closed on Sunday and Monday I seen this line out the door so it must be worth it. I tried again around opening time 10:00am I made another mistake got there at 10:22. Line out the door again I am staying in this line.!!! I'm going to get the full experience. I was last in line and nobody behind me for 15 mins or so... Then people from everywhere bus, bike, taxi ,walking OMG !! This place must be the truth!! My turn came to enter into this place. For one the smell GRABBED my attention!! I was in the doorway then to my Surprise Mr. Doug himself was taking orders I asked him to give me all the suggestions I went madd and ordered the foie gras n duck sausage wild game sausage which was Alligator,Smoked yak, the K C Carr which was Shrimp, pork, mustard grits, also regular Chicago's own dog two others ate them all by the way...EXTREMELY GOOD!!! I But the ABSOLUTE BEST!! Duck Fat Fries!!!! Dear God!!! Sooo goood!!! Satisfaction I tell you. I frequently come to Chicago but I nnnever been here. But for now on I will put this WORLD land mark on my agenda for now on! Well worth the wait!!!"
1446,PUT IT ON MAH FACE 'nuff said.
1447,"4.5 stars. Not as blown away from these sausages as everyone else is, but I liked the creativity and the variety of options that you can get here. The duck sausages, pork sausages, and the regular hot dogs here are all top notch. Some of the pairings work better than others, but of course, much of the food is based on your own taste. I thought the fries here were very good, and thus, rounding up to 5 stars. Doug is a very friendly guy and usually taking orders at the counter. Cash only folks."
1448,"line gets a minus one. I had the fois gras hot dog and duck fat fries. The hot dog was definitely unique and tasty, but not worth a 2-2.5 hour wait!! I wish I could call in because the hot dog is really good."
1449,"One of the things I miss most about Chicago. I wonder what the game of the day is today. If you haven't been, go. If you are visiting, take a trip out of the Loop to see what makes Chicago special (and fat)."
1450,"Two people can eat here for less than $10. The dogs are the best. The fries are pretty damned awesome. Free refills on the pop. Doug is always cheerful and the waitstaff is quick and courteous. Why else would tons of people wait 45 minutes in line? The latest review I just saw of this place says: ""hot dogs are the worst here. They taste greasy and sour. I got very sick to my stomach. The fries are very greasy also. The pop is flat and way too sweet. Plus they are way overpriced and the service is terrible. I even seen a roach"" LMAO! funniest review ever. I hope you all know it's a joke."
1451,"I went to Hot Doug's a few weeks ago so this is a little late...my friend and I biked from downtown which made us feel a little less bad about our pork filled gluttony. We waited about an hour and a half- it was really nice out and everyone seems to be chatty in the line so the time passed fairly quickly. I went for the bacon cheeseburger hot dog- yes the pork sausage was stuffed with cheese and bacon AND topped with more cheese and coca-cola BBQ sauce, I'm probably missing something but it was very decadent and very tastey. I ate every last bite. We of course opted for the duck fat fries which were delicious, but I'm not sure how they really differ in taste from the others? just more crispy? Either way they're fabulous fries. You can definitely split between 2 people. Oh and we ordered a side of cheese to dip them in. Repulsive I know but sooo good. The only part that is highly annoying are the tourists who want to tell the guy at the counter their life story and how they've come all the way from [fill in the blank] and waiting [insert number of hours] for this and they are so excited and blah blah blah. OK lady you've had 1.5 hours to decide what you're eating order and get on with it. That shit was very annoying, have your order ready so we can eat our meat!"
1452,"There have been so many Saturday afternoons I've driven here, saw the line wrapping around the building, then audibled to the nearby BK since I was too hungry to wait. (I used to be able to hit nearby Kuma's Corner as a 2nd option but you can forget about that plan now) I've basically given up eating here on Saturdays. But if there's any reason during the week I decided not to go to work that day, Hot Doug's is always on my mind. Sometimes if I need to head to the burbs for work, I will plan my day SPECIFICALLY to hit Hot Doug's around lunch. Is there still a line at 1:45 PM on a random Tuesday? Yes, but its manageable. Any place that has over an hour wait out the door on weekends and still makes me fight crowds in the middle of the day - AND STILL I am willing to fight them - gets 5 stars. By the way, a few weeks ago I saw Doug walking around Terminal 3 in O'Hare and wanted to go up to him to let him know how much I love his sausage...but that would've been just plain creepy."
1453,"Can you believe Anthony Bourdain has Hot Doug's on his list of ""13 Places to Eat Before You Die""? I can. Mind you, this list is not made up of places in the U.S., it's places spanning the entire world. This is not just a hot dog place, it is an experience like no other of all kinds of tubular meats: rabbit, duck, lamb, spicy Thai chicken, ribeye steak...the list goes on. They have items that are mainstays and they have daily specials that are updated every day on their website. My all-time favorite is the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. On Fridays and Saturdays, they have french fries that are cooked in rendered duck fat. mmmmmm. The lines get pretty long and could circle the block, but after having one of these delicious dogs, the wait will be well worth it."
1454,"you close at 4, omgwtfbbq!? We made the mistake of waiting until the last minute before we needed to head back to the airport and just called ahead and ordered (which was smart because after we left there was a crazy long line), but only ordered the basic dog in stead of the more exotic items on the menu. we didn't get fries, which after reading these reviews below, was obviously a mistake. I like Murphy's better as of now, but I want to come back and get something more exciting and some fries... Guy at the register, so god damn crazy nice, Chicago kinda weirded us out about how nice everyone was... weird."
1455,"OK, after reading all the reviews and seeing it on the Food Network and Travel Chanel a couple of times I had to visit this when I was in the area. The service was great. The owner is incredibly friendly and kinda funny. Not the kind of place where if your not sure what to order they are going to rush you. I actually tried ordering 2 large sodas and he insisted just to order 2 smalls because its free refills and he was going to rip us off when he totaled the check anyway (he was joking obviously). I'll be honest the regular hot dogs were not that great, I mean they tasted like any other hot dog I've had. But the specialty hot dogs are awesome. I remember ordering an angus steak hot dog which was amazing. The regular fries taste just as good as the duck fat fries. The taste difference is subtle and you notice during the after taste. If you there during a time when you can get it I would recommend it. Just remember one order of fries is good enough 2 hungry people. My girlfriend and I made the mistake of ordering duck fat fries and regular fries. The line kinda sucks, but it moves fast. It is well worth it, just order whatever they have on special. Don't order more than 2 (might be tempted with all the selections) because 2 is way more than enough to fill you up."
1456,"Best hot dog (sausage) you've ever had? Yes, surely! Worth a two hour wait? Nope."
1457,"With its atrociously long lines, I don't think Hot Doug's lives up to the hype. I had the foie gras hot dog along with duck fat fries and a few bites of my sister and her boyfriend's hot dogs. Not worth it; give me a Nathan's hot dog instead."
1458,"On the surface, waiting almost 2 hours for a hot dog sounds like one of the dumbest ideas in the world, and I was hesitant at first to even try Hot Doug's. However, as a man that enjoys his processed meats, I knew I had to try what many have called the finest. The day I went, it was well below freezing. After about an hour, I could not feel my toes, and I was pretty sure that I would lose one by the end of the day. Even with the pain of being freezing cold, it was still one of the best dining experiences ever. To make it worth the wait, I ordered three items, the boar sausage with pesto, the corn dog, and the duck fat fries. Each was absolutely delicious. The duck fat fries take decadence to a new level. Those perfectly seasoned confections melted in my mouth with each bite. The corn dog was perfectly crisp with a nice sweet bite of flavor at the end. Mixed with the boar sausage packed with pesto goodness, I could blend the sensations of sweet and savory to take hot dog dining to a place I never knew existed. Even if I had to wait 4 hours, I would go back again and again. Hot Doug's is an experience that should not be missed by anyone that ever visits Chicago."
1459,"This past weekend, I paid a short visit to Chicago to visit some friends. While there, I checked out a few of the city's best specialties (hot dogs and pizza, of course!). I first started out at Hot Doug's. The foie gras dog was just one of the joint's numerous offerings. Intrigued? Keep reading... Hot Doug's was featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations: Chicago episode, so of course I had to try it out. The first thing I noticed was the line out the door and around the corner. Wind and rain didn't deter these dog enthusiasts! I was here for two things in particular - the first was the Foie Gras and Suaternes Duck Sausage, with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel And the second thing can be summed up in three words: DUCK FAT FRIES. Booyah! Sign me up! I first d(o)ug into the foie gras dog. Now if there's anything I like, it's duck, mousse, truffles, and sausage. This sounded like a sure winner. I took a bite and was in heaven. The foie gras was rich, fatty and creamy. I wanted to slurp up the truffle aioli with a straw (don't judge, you know that sounds good). This dog was rich and luxurious. Some might say, a little too luxurious. The creaminess might just be too much for some. I am not those some. We then tackled the duck fat fries. I've said it once, and I'll say it again - if I had to pick two fats to eat for the rest of my life (just two? A travesty!), I'd pick duck and pork, no question. Fried carbs and duck fat sounds like the perfect combination. Sadly, I didn't really taste as much duck as I had hoped in these fries. They were yummy and hot, but I just hoped they would be duckier. Not to worry though, I still finished them. To round out my Hot Doug's experience, I ordered the ""The Dog"" - I figured it was good to try the standard. I got it with everything - mustard, caramelized onions, relish, tomato, pickle and celery salt. Ta-da! Served on a poppy seed bun, The Dog is a far cry from the NYC style hot dog of plain bun and mustard (plus ketchup if you so desire). While my heart will always belong to NYC, I appreciate Chicago dogs for all their toppings - especially that DayGlo relish! Doug's The Dog was perfectly grilled, and the toppings complemented the dog perfectly without overwhelming it. I was particularly fond of the celery salt - sooooo delish! Of course I couldn't pay a visit to Hot Doug's without a picture with Doug himself! Doug was right up front, taking orders at the counter. He was so friendly and down-to-earth. Even little things such as suggesting getting a small soda (""There are free refills"") show that he's in it for the joy of the hot dog. And he's a NYC transplant - heeeey! While the wait at Hot Doug's can be a little crazy, the food, ambiance and experience make it all worth it. If you're ever in Chicago, give Hot Doug's a try!"
1460,"Doug is such a nice guy! My fiance and I arrived at the Hot Doug's counter fishing out smashed dollar bills from our pockets to see if we had enough to buy two of the speciality dogs. It was the ""Doug"" himself at the counter who told us it would be no problem if we didn't have quite enough. I didn't really think he was serious and proceeded to count out the money. It turned out that we did have enough for the dogs. He then asked us if we wanted fries or drinks and of course we said ""no and no""--since we didn't have the money (either with us or in our bank accounts). Doug then asks us if we would have wanted fries if we had had enough money. We mechanically (and enthusiastically) said yes. At this point, I actually started counting out the remaining two dollars and change to see if we had might just have enough for some fries. I didn't have to. God...I mean, Doug, immediately says that we will be getting fries with our food and then tells us to help ourselves to drinks...for free! He does this without a moment's hesitation! Wha'??? I mean, WHO THE HECK does that these days? WHO!?!?!???? I was really touched at what an amazingly nice guy he was and how disinterestedly generous he was. Judging from the amount of people in there he could probably afford it. But still, it is almost unheard of for people to be that generous these days. Needless to say Hot Doug's is a wonderful place, with great people, very cool atmosphere, and obviously the hot dogs are dee-licious. Thank you Doug for being so nice to us. And by the way, although you didn't know this, it was my fianc's birthday that day...so double thanks! These two broke kids LOVE YOU! b+c"
1461,"I saw this place on Bourdain. I wanted to like it. I heard about the 45 Minute Wait for the Hot Dogs. Sorry Doug, I can't say it's worth the wait. Despite all the Sausages that are at $6-$9 a pop, they are just ""Encased"" meats. Worth it to say you talked to tv star Doug at his spot. Unfortunately... No exactly the religious experience as a Pinks or Sweatman's."
1462,"You might have to wait upwards to an hour, but if you go right before the lunch rush, it's only about 15 min during the week. On the weekends... well good luck. They have the most unique and delicious sausages you can order on a bun. I've tried my share of about half the animal kingdom in sausage form from this place and it's always been good. On Fri+Sat they have fries that have been cooked in rendered duck fat which is delicious, but their regular fries during the week are just as fine. Cash only and long wait. Most people would say the food is worth it. I would have to agree."
1463,"Walked a good mile and a half from the Guinness Oyster Fest...only to stand in line for an hour an a half. And it only took us 20-25 minutes to order, be served, and finish our meal. Go figure. Anyhow, onto the food. The atomic dog was ok. Spicy but I think it could have been spruced up with something extra. The Thai Chicken was alright. I liked the seaweed and sriracha on top...but not so much the dog itself. The foie gras was the best dog we tried! Creamy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth duck liver. Yum! I was unimpressed by the duck fat fries and it surely didn't live up to the hype. It pretty much tasted like regular fries. The service is awesome. Doug takes your order and he is patient and has a smile on his face with each order he takes, even when he knows that there is a line of 100 people outside. If Doug had his own bobble head I would for sure stick it on my car dashboard. I love the cartoon-ish feel of the place. The colors remind me of hot dog on a stick...but Hot Doug's is cooler by 100x's. Tips: Cash Only Duck Fat fries only served on Fridays and Saturdays p.s. people, it should be a crime to make your 3 year old child stand in line with you for an hour and a half out in the cold for hot dogs! that's just mean!"
1464,"Must Order: Duck sausage w/ foie gras, Bacon sausage w/ carmelized onions & brie, Duck Fat Fries! There was already a long line wrapping around the building so we knew we were in the right place! As we got moved up in the line and ended up inside we were in awe over the menu. There were tons to choose from and we had a hard time deciding! We also see fries fried in... duck fat! Oh we definitely wanted those! But turns out it was only served on the weekends and we were there on a weekday and were flying to Maryland the next day! When we finally got over the disappointment of missing duck fat fries, we distracted ourselves with trying to select which of the many hot dog options we were going to have. Since we knew that it may be a long time before we would be back there, we ordered not one, not two but FOUR hot dogs. We got up to the counter to order and spent a few minutes complimenting the guy that owns the place (I wanted to take a picture with him!) then ordered our hot dogs. We had the bacon sausage with carmelized onions and brie, the duck sausage with foie gras, the bratwurst with carmelized onions and the classic Chicago dog. Of course none of them (except the Chicago dog, since I didn't want that one anyway) had any mayo or aioli sauces on it. On the side for my boyfriend. Our dogs arrived and we took turns biting into each of the hot dogs. The duck sausage with foie gras was delicious! You really taste the duck flavor and it's not too terribly overpowered by the foie gras. The bacon sausage with the brie was also delicious but quite heavy! You can almost feel your arteries closing and think ""well... if I die now, I'll die with a belly full of bacon sausage & brie and I'm OK with that"". The bratwurst was probably the least action packed of the three but definitely had flavor. I can't say anything about the classic Chicago because I didn't have that one but I think my boyfriend liked it quite a bit."
1465,"I had been looking forward to my visit to Chicago, mostly because I was promised my first trip to Hot Dougs. It lived up to everything I'd heard, and surpassed my wildest hopes. We got there early, waited outside in the freezing cold and had smiles on our faces the entire time...and not because they were frozen in place. Although the specials change often, here's a suggestion: Duck Fat Fries (only available Friday and Saturday!) Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Pork Sausage with Vodka-Cream Marinara and Burrata Cheese The Mountain Man (a damn tasty combination of Elk, Antelope, Venison and Buffalo) with Blackberry Mustard and Goat Cheese Pork and Duck Confit Sausage with Sweet Garlic Mustard, Duck Rillettes and Balsamic-Truffle Drizzle Swedish Potato Sausage with Dill-Garlic Mustard and Caraway Havarti Cheese Doug will shut the shop when he goes out of town, so call first to make sure he's open. Shop accepts cash only and the hours are 10:30-4; no matter what time you head there, be prepared to wait outside in line. But it's worth it!"
1466,"I've been coming to Hot Doug's for about two years now and I've never been disappointed. Sausages and hot dogs seem to be a pretty consistent item and Doug is almost always at the counter so they run a tight ship. I think this isn't so much a hot dog place as it is a sausage joint and no one else does that here in Chicago. Selling polish sausage as well as hot dogs doesn't count either. They have the standard chicago dog which is pretty good but I've had equally good dogs at Byron's and Portillos. However their thuringer and andouille is a constant staple for me. The thuringer alone is a meal in itself because of its size, flavor and nap-inducing greasiness (I mean that in a good way). I made the bold move once of ordering the standard dog, the thuringer and an order of duck fat fries. If you've ever seen the ""itis"" episode of Boondocks then you'll know what I'm talking about when I say i definitely had the itis after that particular lunch. I struggled to stay awake on the drive home and barely made it to my bed twenty minutes later for a good long nap. I've never had the game of the week sausages because of the price (usually $6-8) but its good to know they're available."
1467,YUM SQUARED (is there such a thing). I absolutely love these kind of french fries the fresh cut ones with skin. I can't even complain that I waited about 25 minutes in a hot Chicago day. Thats how good this is. Along with the fries I got the corn dog...I keep it simple! So good!! The breading wasn't soggy it was nice and crisp and the hot dog was done to perfection. $3.75 for a delicious lunch is how it should be!! Im happy to say this place is only 5 minutes from my job so I'll be a regular!! Oh and for the single ladies this place is a sausage fest (pun intended) 95% of the lunch customers I saw were men! Tip: take a friend to chat with in line so the wait doesn't seem so long!
1468,"I'm not sure what the big deal is. The hot dogs were good and the specials were definitely interesting (I had a smoked crawfish and pork sausage) but I'm not sure it was worth waiting 1+ hours in line. Also, maybe I'm not gourmet enough, but what's up with the duck fat fries? I like duck but I really didn't taste anything special about the fries. Maybe I'll have to try it again, but I just don't know what the big deal is. But the food was good but I probably wouldn't wait in the line again"
1469,"I can't believe I forgot to rate this place. The food is pretty tastey... for your choice of sausage. Kangaroo sausage is damn good.... it reminds me of my time in Australia. 'roos are like deer here, so no biggie to eat one there. I love the crazy combinations, if I worked close to there, I would go once a week for the game of the week. It would be great. But since I don't, I just read it every Tuesday morning on their web-site. Its pretty pathetic, but whatever. There are a few things that I can gripe about though: 1. The hours suck. I wish they were open later. 2. Sometimes $8 for a sausage is too much, but soo good. Yes I know they got the usual hot dog for $2 or so. But there are better places for a plain dog IMO. 3. The line is long, but that means its popular, right? I had to change it to 5 stars... after I wrote the review thats all I can think about.... that means its 5 star good"
1470,"You know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kinds. Came here with a couple of friends which meant it was massive sampling time. Classic Chicago dog, rabbit, boar, duck, and pork. Only one I thought that was sub-par was the rabbit, which had so much goat cheese and mustard on top I couldn't really taste much else. Everything else was awesome, the other patrons were jovial and Doug was a pretty chill dude. Protip: Don't sit at a table until you've ordered. On the way home, my roommate was driving...""Right now I'm feeling like I'm in..."" I snapped my fingers, ""Euphoria!"" I was so right."
1471,I'm sorry I have to take a star off my review. And it's not due to anything that Hot Doug has done. I'm sure it's still great. It's just that I will never be able to eat here again due to the ridiculous wait. I went by here the other day and the line was at least twice as long as I have ever seen it. I couldn't even see the end of the line. My time is too valuable. I really don't want to dedicate an entire day to eating a sausage. So we drove on up to Superdawgs as a consolation prize.
1472,"I can't remember the last time I waited in line for 2 hours to eat, but with prodding from the son, we did it, and no less in the rain. You would think the rain would hold folks back at 2pm on a Friday, but I guess duck fat fries only on Friday and Sat really draws the crowds. Hot Doug's is a novel and tasty sausage experience, but I have to dock a star for the wait, and its impact on an otherwise 5 star experience. The sausages and toppings were unique and tasty. The infamous duck fat fries were good but somewhat disappointing - they were like good, regular fries today. I actually had to check with server if we got the right fries, as I guess I was expecting more fattiness for $3.50 per serving. We tried 6 sausages - veggie sausage (you almost wouldn't notice), bacon and cheddar elk (interesting gamey taste and firm texture), chicken sausage sante fe style (actually best value at $3.50), shrimp/pork sausage with goat cheese (my favorite), mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken and gouda cheese (least favorite, strong on the cheese and mustard), and fois gras and duck sausage (very rich, but very good!). FYI - Since we finally got to order near the closing time of 4pm, I asked Doug (the friendly guy taking your order and cash) how he handles closings - if you're in line at 4pm, you'll get served; they were still lined up outside at 4:40pm when we left."
1473,"I don't remember how I started going to Hot Doug's but I don't really care. This. Place. Is. AWESOME!!! I have been going here for years now. Expect to wait a long time to even get into the place. I drove by it last week and it was open for twenty minutes and the line was already along the side of the building to the alley. For those who frequent the place, you know what I am talking about. When the hubby and I decide that we will wait for hot dogs ( and you will for at least an hour depending on the time of day), we always look on our iPhone to see what the specials are. We read them separately and then discuss what we may possibly get. If anyone listened to our conversation, they would think we would never to able to make up our minds. All the specialty dogs look great and you just never know which one will be THE one. We both tend to get a Chicago Dog, the classic, and a specialty. And of course, DUCK FAT FRIES. Yes, fries fried in rendered duck fat is worth the clogged arteries, the spike in your cholesterol and ultimately, a heart attack. But wouldn't that be a great way to go? They only are served Friday and Saturday so that of course will add additional time to your wait. But trust me when I say that they are worth whatever wait it is. The owner, Doug, takes your order. I love this. This is a guy who takes pride in his dogs and his work. He is always pleasant which can be difficult when you have a line down the street. They are also pretty strict about saving tables. You can't. Only when you order your food can you then sit down at a table or the counter. Every time I go there, it is always the same two people dropping food at the tables. When you order your food with Doug (cash only!!!), there is a tip jar next to him. Drop money in there. It is hard work for the two servers to get the tables cleaned and drop food off when it's busy from open to close. They deserve the tip so don't be cheap! With that said, the food speaks for itself. We always bring people from out of town here after they agree to waiting. No has yet been disappointed. This is a place that is a must stop, must experience if you travel to Chicago. It is that good."
1474,Hot Doug's Rocks! I remember the first couple of times we went to try this place...the line was out the door and down the street...I looked at my wife and said not today. Then one day as we were driving by we saw only a couple of people in line...my wife jumped out of the car and I went to find a parking space. The next thing I knew there were 10 people behind her...this place is like joining a cult for encased meats! The sausage and dogs are so good! The line is worth the wait. I have heard stories that if you are not in the door before closing...you will be locked out...so come early! I do recommend you check the website before going because Doug likes to take time off. A couple of times we went....only to find the door locked. This place makes you work for your food but it is so worth it. The website also has the current menu.
1475,"Pretty much exactly what I wanted out of it. We arrived at 1045 with a line that went down the block, and didn't leave until 1245, so keep in mind that the wait really is that long. I had two hot dogs, and an order of duck fat fries. The foie gras dog was very good, but I wasn't a fan of the way the foie gras was prepared. However, the duck sausage and the truffle aioli was unbelievable. I definitely don't regret ordering it. My second dog was the Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Maple-Smoked Cheddar Cheese. I honestly cannot think of anything that I've eaten in recent memory that tasted better than this hot dog, and I am not exaggerating at all. The duck fat fries were very good as well, and 1 order is large enough to share with 1 or maybe even 2 other people. I will definitely go back, but will wear a warmer coat during the winter to make sure I don't catch a cold while waiting in line."
1476,"OMG this place is absolutely ridiculous. It took us 2 hours to walk/bus/metro it here, then we waited 50 minutes in line, but it was ACTUALLY worth it to eat these sausages. We got the Uber Garlic Pork Sausage (chipotle dijonnaise, vintage cheddar cheese and roasted garlic cloves) and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris). Obviously not the most healthy choices for mid-afternoon meal, but hey. The flavors were perfect. The textures were wonderful. Doug was a sweet happy man. It was a ridiculously decadent and flavorful meal, except it was not a duck fat fries day.... PS they have really weird hours. But they can do whatever they want, they're Hot Doug's."
1477,"I feel like I should give this place 5 stars just because everyone else does...but I would NEVER do the a little over an hour wait again. It's totally worth doing it once, but any other time I'll go on a weekday and skip the duck fat fries. I had 2 sausages as well as bites of 3 more of friends. My favorite hands down was the chicken sausage with mozzarella and spinach and bacon mayo and something else delicious. All of them were good and very unique. Hot Doug should really think of expanding to cut down on the wait time and speed up the seating process. My friends and I finally got people to leave a table (stared them down) after they sat there and just chatted over their sodas with a ton of people waiting...rude."
1478,"Yum yum yum! Oh how I wished this place was open later than 4pm on weekdays! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and waited in line for about an hour. I would definitely tTry to bring a book, magazine, IPhone or interesting company. No matter how fast you think the line is moving, when you finally get to the register, it will be at least an hour wait. I had the apple chicken sausage with cubes of madeira cheese topped with some type of chutney and my bf had the ""Keira Knightly"" (like a regular Chicago hot dog but spicy). The hot dogs were a little smaller than I expected especially since mine was around $7 (the ""Keira Knightly"" was only $2.50) but once I took that first bite I didn't care - I was in hot dog heaven. Every ingredient had such a distinct flavor but all went so well together and I was surprisingly full by the last bite. The ""Keira Knightly"" was also good but nothing that you can't find at any other hot dog joint. If you're going to wait that long, I would definitely go for one of the specialty hot dogs. We also got the duck fat fries (only available on Fridays/Saturdays) which was definitely the highlight of our meal! They came out hot and crisp but then melted deliciously in your mouth. Didn't even really need salt, pepper or ketchup. Unbelievably good! Definitely want to try the duck + foie gras dog next time and get my own order of duck fat fries :D TIP: CASH ONLY + get the small soda if you dine in (free refills)!"
1479,"Could've done without the horribly long line after traveling nearly an hour to get there, but the dogs were good. Gotta love Vienna beef! Had a Chicago dog and split a Polish with my boyfriend. Fries were good. Don't know if it was worth the wait, but it was certainly one of the best dogs in town (and believe me...we ate a ton in the week we were there) Would definitely visit again, but would try to get there just before they open to avoid the lunch rush. Tips: Bring cash, don't go during peak lunch hours/weekends"
1480,"That is the longest I've ever waited and the most I've ever paid for a hot dog, but it was well worth it. The elk and cheddar was nothing really special, besides the novelty of eating elk. Foie Gras Duck Dog (sounds like a science experiment gone wrong) was better. While the crayfish and pork sausage w/ cajun remoulade and creamy goat cheese was phenomenal!!!! It has to be the best dog I've ever eaten in my life! Food was amazing, just hate the long lines and short business hours."
1481,"I took my fiance here today. We thought that maybe around 2pm on a holiday wouldn't be too crowded. We were wrong, but that's ok. I don't know what else I can say - Hot Doug's lives up to the hype, Doug is awesome, the food is amazing, the line is long. Special shout out to the cheese fries - underrated food item that were really freaking good here."
1482,"The hours suck (only 10-4pm M-Sat). The location sucks. The perpetual long-ass-line on Saturdays sucks. Paying cash sucks. But there is nowhere else in this world where I can get a Cognac and Cranberry Smoked Chicken Sausage with Blackberry Butter and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey. or a Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Green Apple Creme Fraiche & Smoked Almonds. They might be the most inventive, tastiest ""encased meats"" I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Thank you Doug."
1483,"Ok, I guess Doug doesn't really need another review for this place. He knows it's great, and if you look at how many reviews and the star rating... you know it's great too. I worked across the street at Midway Games for two years and this was the default lunch spot for most of the company. They serve up brats the Wisconsin which is the only real way you should eat it. Meanwhile the hot dogs are all Chicago, you can even spice it up with the fire dog. If you're the adventurous type Doug is more than willing to assault you with the sausage of the week. Who knows what kind of animal it used to be, I just know I've had rattlesnake, elk, and probably a couple endangered animals. All are tasty with his custom condiments. Doug is super friendly and so are his staff. Despite having a line wrapping around the building they'll remember your name if a regular. Speaking of the line... I know it's daunting at first but it moves quickly and it's worth it. I only wish they were open a little longer because where I work now is way far."
1484,"We must've hit this place on the most random of random Fridays, as the wait today was only about 10 minutes. Awesome. Good start. Charming Doug at the counter, also as foretold. But maybe I just read too many reviews, and heard too much about this place. While it was good, I didn't feel like I was eating food blessed by an angel or anything. The duck fat fries were tasty, and bizarrely addictive. We couldn't figure it out, they didn't taste much different than any other fry, except they were less greasy, but still - we cleaned the bottom of the cardboard. I had to try a regular hot dog, pretty poor and it fell apart. We also had the spinach & feta - meh. Too many olives, not too much taste. The standout was the rattlesnake sausage. That was top notch. I'm sure we'll be back, it's a kitchy place to take out of towners, but I'm not rushing to get there. Unless I figure out there's a sausage I like better than the spinach/feta, and then this whole review will be up for review."
1485,"At long last, I finally managed a pilgrimage to Hot Doug's -- my only request when visiting my girl and her man on a cooooold Chi-town winter (the coldest in *years*, apparently) ... (well, actually, Alinea would have been nice but that wasn't possible on such short notice...). We arrived around 11:30, saw no line outside, and immediately parked. Praising our luck and yes, the cold weather, we nearly ran in our eagerness. By the time we reached the doors, there was a bit of a queue leaving us standing outside in ~18-degree cold for about 1 minute. Patrons left and we were indoors. Once inside -- ah, how to choose? We immediately gravitated towards the specials, ordering 1 dog for each of us, 1 dog to share, and the duck fat fries (served only on Fridays and Saturdays). One in particular screamed my name: Calvados-infused duck sausage with sauce moutarde, Grand Marnier pork pate and truffle-infused balsamic cream. Ultimately I think I prefered the flavors in the sausages of my companions -- there was just a tad too much moutarde that overwhelemed the more delicate flavors of the pate and the duck sausage which tried valiantly to combat the mustardy spicy-sourness with sweet undertones...also, I didn't get any truffle taste at all... Nora M. chose Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Citrus Mojo mayo and Mad River Aged Goat Cheese - the jerk was smoky and perfectly paired with the brie-like slabs of goat cheese; Kevin ordered Portuguese Chourico with a Saffron Rouille and Iberico cheese - also a beautiful, perfectly balanced mouthful... the duck fat fries were the best fries I had ever tasted and were delicious even though they seemed a little undersalted. To share we had the Game of the Week: Rattlesnake sausage with Pomegranate mayo and cheese-stuffed hot peppers -- very delicious and flavorful, spice from the peppers was cut nicely by the soft cream cheese. Doug was at his usual spot at the cash register and, upon learning that I was visiting from the left coast, comped us our sodas. The specials run around $7-8; the standard dogs $1.75-4... cash only; closed on Sundays. The concept is simply amazing and makes me long for a branch out in SF... By the time we left, the line was just beginning to curl out the door and around the building..."
1486,"Don't order a Chicago dog, nothing wrong with it, in fact it is pretty darn tasty. You must eat the specialty dogs. Dougs is not a hot dog joint. It is the mecca of encased meats."
1487,"After dropping some friends off at the airport and realizing I had the rest of the day to kill, I decided to give Hot Doug's a try. Having visitors during the week was my excuse to try all the places I'd read about on Yelp/heard good things about elsewhere that sounded as though they'd be madhouses on the weekends. Hot Doug's was great. I was there around 2 on a Wednesday and there was a line but it moved quickly. Once I ordered, I was really surprised by how quickly my order was ready - it was probably like 5 minutes. I was ready to wait longer. Also, Doug was super nice. It's obvious that he's doing what he loves. Anyone else behind that register would be bored/annoyed by 2 p.m., but he was cheery and kind. I'm sure not much else needs to be said about this place. I love the creative daily specials, which I'm sure will keep me from ever ordering a regular hot dog here. Sometimes (usually when I'm hungry), I just visit the website to see what they're doing on a given day, it's that interesting to me. I tried two of the specials and felt like an adventurous sausage connoisseur, which is obviously something I've always aspired to. The sausages were totally delicious, btw. The only sour note - and it was no fault of Hot Doug's - was the dude in line behind me. He was with his girlfriend, who got maybe 2 words out the entire time. In the 15 minutes (possibly less) for which he stood behind me, he managed to insult his girlfriend's religion to her face, call the city a ""hellhole"" and berate her for living here while extolling the virtues of the suburb he lives in, and go over each and every bicycle available that sucks. Bad attitude doesn't even capture it. It's maybe the one time in my life I've actually been tempted to pull the old, ""If you don't like this city GET THE (expletive) OUT!"" Standing in front of a self-important gasbag like that was not fun, but it was worth it for the sausage."
1488,"I know there are hundreds of review on this place, but it deserves this much hype. The hot dogs are really original and tasty Go if you don't mind a line (the line was very long, but it moved) I waited 30 minutes but I brought a DS to play against my friends and there was neat stuff on the wall to look at. Also thinking over the savory combinations on the menu posted on the wall passes the time. Some may raise an eyebrow at $8 hot dogs, or may not be adventurous enough to stomach the cranberries brie or whatever, but the more normal chicago style dog is $1.75 and was one of my favorite dogs. We ordered 5 dogs to split between us, each had very different flavors. I missed out on the duck fat fries tho...."
1489,"Some of us can go hot dog crazy, but my friend Sonia ordered 3 dogs from this place! And she took pics of it! I'm pretty sure it was because of their names"" ""The Elvis, The Paul Kelly, and The Dog"". She was from out of town, so I let it go. I got the ""Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris"". With the name like that, I would have ordered another two or three - but I couldn't - one was enough. The cheese fries were crunchy and spectac. I had to eat these because my friend was too full from the dog's that she has eaten. I didn't mind at all. If only I came on a Friday or Saturday, then I would have eaten the duck fat fries. I can't believe it took me this long to finally eat here. After seeing it on the Hungry Detective and No Reservations, reading about it in the Chicagoist, seeing it on Yelp's Most talked about and their top list, and seeing Doug Sohn himself at a lecture he did at my school - I was sure to visit soon, but I could not find anyone to go with. Thank God Sonia shares my love of sausage..errr...the edible kind. Next time, I'm going to hope that this special is around, ""Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy White Peach Mayonnaise, Creme de Brie Cheese and Roasted Plantains "". That's like word porn."
1490,"It was a Three Dog Night! Super delicious, great experience, but brutally long wait on a Saturday. Most of the people seemed to be tourists eager to check out the legendary encased meats. By the time we were at the register, I felt like we summited Everest. The food gets served surprisingly fast once you get through the line, through. We had the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade"", ""Veal, Pork and Chive Bockwurst"" and ""Rosemary and Garlic Smoked Chicken Sausage"". All were equally delicious and perfectly complimented the duck fat fries. I'll be back, but during the week when the line will hopefully be shorter. Cheers to Doug for such a great place!"
1491,"I've been wanting hot dougs since I landed in chicago! Unfortunately I didn't get to go here till my last day in the city. I woke up still full from my dinner (read my giardino's review) 12 hrs prior and not even thinking about food and actually feeling quite ill. Also I don't normally eat hot dogs or really meat at 1030 in the morning but an exception had to be made! But nothing would of stopped me from trying this famous hot dog spot anyways. We hopped on the metra to get there...we got off and was totally lost and ended up grabbing a cab.. I don't think we would have found the place without it... We got there 30 min prior to them opening so we were hanging out like crazy hot dog fiends at 10am...along with the others that were already in line. I ordered the selma hayak and waited patiently for my ""mighty mighty hot"" andoullie sausage dog. Normally I am rather impatient when it comes to food and often wish food comes out quicker than it does..but being that I wasn't hungry I hoped it would take while. Unfortunately for me it came out in less than 5 minutes.... What should I have expected? It wasn't like I ordered a pizza.... The hot dog was pretty tasty. Not spicy enough for me but it was still scumptious. Natalie T.'s bf liked it so much he ordered another. I would definately have to say this was my favorite spot we hit upon our visit to the windy city. It was well worth it and totally was everything I anticipated. The only thing I wish was that I wasn't not hungry because then I know I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more! But again, still delicious! Ah I don't think ill look at a hot dog or polish sausage the same way again.... Damn you Hot Dougs!"
1492,"Never been impressed.... Duck fat fries are forgettable, like floppy greasy limp dinner fries. I always buckle when trying to pick my meal, so many amazing choices on paper -- unfortunately nothing yet to delivery that hot awesomeness to my mouth. Also, I've got to wonder about Anthony Bourdain. I had that same duck foie gras. I found the too rich and muddle it really lost that great delicate flavor. I'll keep going back trying to find something worth the long lines and horrible business hours. Until then 2 stars it is!"
1493,"Doug's has great sausages and a wide selection of exotic meats. The very friendly Doug himself takes the orders and works the register every day. The workers are always very good and courteous. My tips: If you want a hot dog, get it ""steamed"" and not ""charred"". If you want something more exotic and they have it available, I can't recommend the Alligator enough; it's my favorite. The Andouille sausage is great, it's one of the more underrated sausages they have. Expect to wait in line for a while. The line is regularly stretched outside and down the block."
1494,This place rocks! The line suks but the food is soooo worth it! Duck fat fries are awesome! Duck sausage rocks!
1495,"I found out about this place from a friend and laughed at the name. It just sounded funny. Well, I don't laugh any more. These are, by far, my absolute favorite hot dogs besides Gene & Judes in River Grove. I dare you to try Hot Doug's. You'll never think of hot dogs again without also thinking of returning to Hot Doug's some day. They have great polish and italian sausage too."
1496,"Yeah, you have to wait... but anticipation is half the fun because the pay-off is so worth it. I had a tasty chicken sausage with all the fixins and shared a big heap of french fries. Everyone who works there is happy and the sausages can't be beat. The. Stuff. Dreams. Are. Made. Of. Hot Damn, Hot Dougs!"
1497,I guess I don't have anything new to add that hasn't already been said but I couldn't not add my name to the list of people who love/crave Hot Doug's. Went there again a few days ago and again left completely satisfied. I had the following: - Spicy Beef Hot Link with Coca-Cola BBQ Sauce and Applewood-Smoked Cheddar Cheese - The Teuben - The Dog (Chicago Style) I know...lots of food but too great to pass up. The Spicy Beef Hot Link is now my favorite sausage available at Hot Doug's. It is seriously unbelievable and I am most likely going back on Saturday to get a few more (with some duck fat fries of course).
1498,"Clearly I'm not writing anything new here with so many reviews. Hot Doug's serves the best hot dogs ever. Period. I don't know what more I can tell you. There's a wide array of hot dogs to get and I suggest getting several and the ""duck fat fries,"" if they're available on the day you're there. You gotta get the classic Chicago dog, all toppings, no catchup, with a poppyseed bun. I also got the daily special, which was a bacon and chicken hot dog with a delicious mess of toppings. Unbelievable. Doug, the owner (and hot dog connoisseur), personally takes each of the orders himself. He told me ""I don't care if there's a boot on the menu. If it's fried in duck fat, you order it."""
1499,"I probably should have had more than just a coffee for the day, when I lined up for lunch at 2pm, since I'd end up waiting 90 minutes for the encased meats. You get hungrier and hungrier as you inch your way out of the piercing cold shadows of Hot Doug's and emerge to the sunlight of N. California Ave and eventually cram yourself into the three layers of doors inside. When you get to the front, Doug is super nice and doesn't try to rush you - he understands that you waited forever and you might want to take some time ordering the right stuff. You can't say much besides that the hot dogs are very delicious, and for having that much of a menu, it's impressive that the quality's good from the basics to the fancy ones. For the three of us, we had 10+ hot dogs, so I forgot what we got. In the encasement, we had: chicken, pigs, cows, bison, lamb. They were all tasty animals. I was disappointed with the duck fat fries - nothing special or memorable. Another disappointing thing is the buns - you gotta toast the buns. Despite that, as a tourist, it was fun to wait the wait and live to tell the tale."
1500,"Yes, Yes, YES! I currently live in NYC and everytime I come back home, I gotta get my fix and gorge on Chicago gems that I just can't get anywhere else. We just avoided the long line at around 11 AM on a Thursday. The Chicago-style hot dog is, of course, a classic. The Veal and Parmesan was aight but the Spicy Cajun was surprisingly addictive! Pure culinary genius, I tell you!! The fries were also yummy. And to boot, the guy behind the counter instantly gets you in a good mood. I guess you would be as hype as him too if you had access to Hot Doug's all day."
1501,"Ok, giving Hot Doug's a great review at this point is like making public note of the fact that Scarlet Johansson has a nice body. But I love them both so. And here goes. To make myself feel better during another of my fun ""Furlough Friday's"" this summer, I made the short pilgrimage. Longest line I've seen yet since I've been going there: 1 hour 15 minutes standing outside watching My Name is Earl episodes on my tiny iPod. But so worth it. Got a spicy Thai sausage with peanut sauce and shaved coconut and an Irish banger with Honkers Ale mustard and Irish cheddar. And, of course, duck fries (since it is Friday and, well why wouldn't I?) Or more simply, Holy Jebus. If you haven't gone, just go."
1502,"Since this place has to many reviews I will keep it short n sweet. Go on Friday, the lines arent as bad as saturday. Especially in winter. Get the duckfat fries and some delicious encased meet that will blow your mind. Cash only!! I just wish it was closer to the el, its a bit hard to get to...then again I cant imagine what the lines would be like if it was."
1503,"We were fortunate to find parking close to the place but at the same time turned off by the long line of hot dog enthusiasts that extended almost to the next block. The first thought was to come back on a slower day but then it was Wednesday afternoon at 2pm. It could not be slower than that. So we lined up. The line moved quite quickly and soon reached the owner who was taking the order. My gut was telling me to order one of each dogs but I restrained myself to order a Keira Knightley and my wife ordered a Selma Hayek. We each ordered duck fat fries. We absolutely loved the dogs but I was not able to taste the difference between normal fries and the duck fat fries. I am not a big fan of hot dogs normally but I really liked the dogs here. Selma Hayek, as suggested by the menu was not as hot as Keira Knightley though."
1504,"It's a good place for hotdog once in awhile. It's quite expensive ($4 for regular hotdogs and $7.50 for specials) We had the Chicago, Italian, King Dave, Smoked duck and Atomic bomb. Note: Atomic bomb is very spicy. All hotdogs taste the same!"
1505,"Just to add kindle to the fire... great encased meats, done right. Even though they're now nationally respected, Doug's still keeps prices low. This is the best thing about the location, and probably the reason they're so busy. They exemplify quality + value. Great regular-style dog. I've enjoyed alligator and other unusual encased meals before; for those who haven't been here my advice is just order the one that looks most intriguing and keep an open mind. It's a fun food experience. Someday I'll have to try those duck fat fries, though 2 hours waiting outside on the weekend for french fries cooked in poultry lard seems pretty absurd. It's definitely time, Doug. Open locations downtown and in the north burbs. You're gonna be rich. For gosh sakes at least extend the hours to bar time."
1506,Crap Howdy I love this place!!!!! Classic dog a must but the specialty sausages and such are KILLER!! Stop by for a great lunch but don't linger after you finish. Make room the next guy!
1507,"You usually don't have to travel more than a three block radius in any part of the fine city of Chicago to find a handful of hot dog joints. As wonderful as they are, Hot Doug's is simply on another level. Don't let the line intimidate you. Think of it more as waiting for your favorite Rollercoaster at Six Flags. No matter how long the line, you know what you get out of it will leave you satisfied for hours, if not days. And if this is your first ride, expect to be come away glowing. Hot Doug's is a total gem. It manages to keep the traditional Chicago style Hot Dog mantra, whilst offering unique and enticingly new alternatives. WELL worth the wait."
1508,"Let's face it. The world would be a better place if Zombies craved hot dogs instead of brains. Hot Doug's was my last stop on a 6 stand 'hotdog tour' of Chicago, straight out of one of those Travel CNN articles about Chicago's best hotdog stands. I was looking for the best overall hotdog experience, not just the best dog, or the best price. I'm glad I held it together and made it to this place, it was easily the best stand we visited that weekend. 9.75 out of 10, lost .25 since it wasn't the cheapest place we visited. I ordered the brat, with everything. My buddy ordered the Thurminger. They were so good, we went back and ordered more. Fries were right on. This place got points for price, taste, cleanliness, service (he'll tell you how you should top it if you ask him), and ambiance. If Elvis is alive, he eats here at Hot Doug's. So if you are a zombie, drop the medula oblongata and go to Hot Doug's. Ymmmm, more Doug's!"
1509,"I really, really, really miss this place, especially now that I live in a city almost completely devoid of a decent dog. I used to live not 5 minutes away from here and I really took it for granted - not just for the classic Chicago dog or firedog, but also for the more exotic menu items. Last one I got was some sort of venison sausage dressed with blue cheese - I forget exactly, but point being it was delicious. And those duck fat fries are a thing to dream of. Doug's the man. He'll recognize the regulars but is super friendly to everyone. Lines can get long, but it's really a minor issue that I never complained about. Now that I'm 2,000 miles away I find myself visiting the website frequently just to read the specials."
1510,"Made my first visit to Hot Doug's this week. Couldn't believe the line. Unfortunately, I came unprepared, the joint is a cash only establishment and I was not able to order a specialty hot dog because I couldn't afford one with the little cash I had with me (they run $7 -$8 and yes I had less than that). I was able to purchase the Keira Knightley, a spicy hot dog and it was pretty good. I'll have to come back some other time and try something exotic. What's cool is the Doug himself takes your order; he's patient and helps you figure out what you want."
1511,"When I was here, it's really cold that day. I was in a long long line.... But, you got try this place no excuse! Foie gras dog?? You have to be there 10:30 am open time If you want Foie gras dog cuz sometime sold out. It's really good... Also, duck fat fries is really tasty. Service is really quick and kindness as well. I love love this place!"
1512,"I am at ease that I FINALLY got to try Hot Doug's. In fact, I think I might mark it on my calendar. Over the years, I have heard so many wonderful things about this place, but for reasons (mostly because they close at 4, and I work on Saturdays), I haven't been able to make it there. So today was the day! Natalie M. and I went today, a Thursday afternoon at about 1:30pm. We thought that were were going to miss the lunch rush, but there was a wait. After about 10 minutes or so (not bad at all) it was finally our turn. Doug was very nice and very patient in taking our order. Natalie M. recognized him right away from all the exposure he's had on TV., however I recognized him from his BIG poster at Kendall College. The guy is a Chicago Culinary icon! You could tell that he loves his job and appreciates all the business. A lot of hot dog joints are extremely fast paced and you really have to be prepared to order, and you better order fast and NOT pause or else you might get chewed out. But not here. The whole experience is very pleasant and it's pretty calm. So, we get our drinks and sit down at a table to wait for our food. Our two Pete Shelly's and fries come out in about 3 minutes. The buns were fresh and the dogs were big and flavorful! I loved the fresh, snappy pickle that was COLD (not flimsy and hot) that came on my dog. The relish was just about the best relish ever and complimented the dog very well. The only criticism I found was that the fries were a little too well done for me...idk to me, they were pretty dark. I had a great lunch at Hot Doug's. I recommend that everyone go there to have a great dog and a great time. The prices are great, the food is delicious and it is definitely worth the wait! Hot Doug's seems to feed ALL types of people from all types of backgrounds, who belong to all social statuses. There were younger people, older people, businessmen and women and families. To me, if you can lure that many types of people to your food, then you must be good! Great Job, Hot Doug's!"
1513,"Sometimes waiting in line is rewarded with a reassuring meal that validates the wait. And sometimes you realize it was like waiting 20 minutes for the women's bathroom at a club; you got what you waited for, but you left feeling empty and with a little toilet paper stuck to your new heels. Happy to say that Hot Doug's was the former, and that their bathroom had no wait and was relatively clean. In our case, we waited around 40 minutes, but the weather was nice, and the other people in line were fun to watch (mostly people in their 20s and 30s, many with children, since it was a Saturday). After waiting in line, the man at the counter was so friendly that you almost forgot there were three hundred people behind you. After you order, you can eat inside or outside (really an alleyway by the restaurant, but it's clean, and the servers will bring your food to you). They have a case by the counter with local and mainstream sodas. We ordered the spicy Thai chicken sausage with sriracha mustard and seaweed-sesame salad, the cranberry and shiraz wild boar sausage with sweet curry mustard and grand canaria cheese, and the duck fat fries. I think the Thai chicken sausage was the superior of the two, but it was nice to share both to alternate the spicy with the sweet. In case you were curious, having the seaweed-sesame condiment is absolute genius. Both sausages were cooked nicely and retained juices inside while having a little of the grill on the outside (if you know what I mean). The duck fat fries were quite nummy but not very crispy. Still, I had to tell myself to stop eating them. We shared one order of the fries between the two of us. If you have the time to wait, the experience is fun and gives you a story to tell your friends."
1514,"Wow. Friday afternoon at 1:30. We get to Hot Doug's and hope that the line isn't too long. We were greeted with an hour long wait for our growling stomachs. But the wait was totally worth it! The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage is hands down the tastiest sausage I've ever had. So rich and buttery... mmm mmm mmmmm! I also had the Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage. It was also delicious but was not as delicious as the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage. The irish whiskey cheese really went well with the sausage, but was only ok on its own (granted I'm not a huge cheese guy). I also had the fries cooked in duck fat while my friend had regular fries. After doing a comparison, the flavor was very slightly different but not really enough for me to say something like ""man! these duck fat fries are the best!"" Their fries are good though, but not sure if the duck fat ones are worth the extra money. On the sheer awesomeness of the foie gras dog alone, this place gets 5 stars. From a guy who practically has 5 stomachs, I can say that I was pleasantly stuffed after having the two dogs and fries! I had high expectations coming in and left satisfied. Well done, Doug! Remember, cash only!"
1515,"When I was planning my trip to Chicago last this month, I was told... emphatically... by 2 different people to try Hot Doug's. They said that regardless of the line, I absolutely HAD to have a dog from there. So, my last day in town we decide on Hot Doug's for breakfast. Would you believe that at 11am on a Tuesday we had to wait 45 min JUST to get in the door of the restaurant?! I'm telling ya'll... it's THAT good. I gorged myself on the Mountain Man dog - an amazing combination of Elk, Venison, Bison, and Antelope (?) meats encased together to create the best sausage/dog of my LIFE. The meaty masterpiece was topped with a ton of goat cheese (yes!) and a cherry-vodka sauce. Other members of our group had the spicy Salma Hayek, a traditional Chicago dog, an alligator dog topped with gouda & a shrimp remoulade, and the extremely spicy Sonoran dog. Ladies & gentleman... there was not a disappointed stomach in the house. Hot dawgs indeeeeeeed."
1516,Holy guacamole this place is amazing. The fois gras sausage literally rocked my world
1517,"There is so much wrong here... For one I got there about 3 minutes before their posted closing time, walked in, and then was asked to leave although I was in line and there was no one behind me because they simply said they were closed. I also think it's pretty arrogant to only be open at certain times slinging gourmet encased meats. It's all hype... nothing there is worth going out of your way for... and yeah duck fat fries... they may be ok, but what a disgusting concept. I would rather give a business that cares to be open for it's customers the money. Not a business that tries to create popularity by limiting its availability."
1518,"Foie gras and duck sausage in a bun, if that's not worth 5 stars I don't know what is. The long waits are with it, even in the winter."
1519,"I visited this popular establishment shortly after the city banned Foie Gras from Chicago restaurants. And what was on the menu that day but a hot dog featuring the very contraband itself. It sounded like it couldn't possibly be good, so of course I ordered it. I wouldn't recommend it -- it tasted like fat. Melt-in-your-mouth, top grade buttery tastelessness. Though the foie gras didn't do it for me, the hot dog itself was rabbit and was delicious. I appreciate being able to choose unusual and exotic selections from a menu, even if my choices don't work out in my favor. The other day, my nearest comedor was offering banana soup. Who would have thought to boil chicken in blended banana? Delicious! Hot Doug's is a place for people who appreciate fine food in a fast food setting. Or, gourmets wishing to spend a lazy Saturday in sweatpants. Or, seekers of unusual foods in a cheap and unpretentious atmosphere. Caramba, I almost forgot about the duck fat fries! What toothsome morsels!"
1520,"Just go.... A lot of people are deterred because lines can get very long. I regularly wait 2 hours. A good way to get around this is to call ahead Monday through Wednesday and pick up your food. They don;t have duck fat fries, but everything else is spectacular."
1521,"This is NOT just another run-of-the-mill Chicago hot dog joint. Take a look at the web site and menu, and you'll see why. Add to that the friendly fun atmosphere, and you have yourself a truly unique establishment. I work nearby, and frequent Doug's for lunch - especially when having a bad day at the office, it always cheers me up. Be prepared to wait in long lines outside anytime on the weekends, and sometimes during peak lunch hours during the week, but it's well worth it. Vegetarians, never fear - veggie friends of mine have touted the veggie dog as one of the best they've ever head. Go now!"
1522,"I simply cannot put into words what a fine institution and emporium of encased meats this modest restaurant has become. I've stood outside when it's -5F and when it's 100F, in lines that wrapped halfway down the block. I've taken every one of my friends from out of town and I will continue to do so. Doug is a culinary genius and a hell of a nice guy to boot. Hint for vegetarians: order the Pete Shelley / Steve Diggle / Howard Devoto / Buzzcocks-themed veggie dog with any of the toppings off the specialty dogs. Doug wholeheartedly approves anytime my special lady or any of our vegetarian friends order in this manner. For carnivores, you can't go wrong with the weekly specials or game and go for the duck fat fries (Pommes de terre frites au gras de canard, Je pense ... Mon francais est tres mauvais). That plus a bottle of the spicy ginger ale (in winter) or a Green River (in summer) and you've got a fine meal. A few things to consider: this establishment takes cash and cash only, there is only one high chair for young whelps - only one by design, you will get stuck behind some jackass hipster who thinks he's funnier than Doug that holds up the line for half an hour & seating can be awfully tight at times. Don't panic - there are a billion ATMs nearby, rarely are there more than 2 kids at most inside, Doug's banter helps regulate the flow into/out of the restaurant and the food is always, always worth it. Turns out there aren't any finer words in the English language than ""encased meats"", my friends."
1523,"The alligator sausage with shrimp remoulade (sp?) and white cheese was SINCERELY not only the best sausage I have EVER tasted, but best combo of flavors I have ever tasted on a bun. Always amazing service by all the hard workers there, Doug is always patient and friendly and funny, EVERYTHING tastes great- I never have any fear of trying something new, and the atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Just know you might have to wait in line a long while, but its SO. TOTALLY. WORTH IT. If you havent gone yet, GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO."
1524,"I was visiting Chicago and needed something to eat that Minnesota didn't offer so a friend of mine who lived there recommended Hot Doug's. He told me it was shown on the food channel once, but I didn't realize that would also mean waiting in line for an hour and a half. If you're not in a rush to be somewhere I recommend giving this place a try, at least once in your life. It truly is different and a gem. I have tried the Chicago Style Dog, The Salma Hayek, The Sally Vega, The Charlie Sheen and James Sohn, a polished sausage with some swiss cheese on it (forgot the name), and duck fat fries. Out of all of those my favorite was the polished sausage w/some swiss cheese and my least favorite would be The Charlie Sheen and James Sohn. It was my least favorite because it was mini bagel dogs and I found the bagel part make everything dry. I also didn't find anything extra special about the duck fat fries as everyone is claiming...they honestly taste just like regular fries to me! Pros: -inexpensive -lots and lots of varieties to choose from -Friendly and helpful customer service Cons: -long line -restaurant set up is kind've crowded + all of the people there too -street parking which gets hard to find b/c of all of the people there trying out hot doug's too. -they cut you off from waiting in line at 4pm daily -closed all day sundays I definitely would come back to try the other dogs that I haven't tried out yet!"
1525,"There's really only one way to put this... Hot Doug's rocks. And that's an understatement. So much so that they can close down for several consecutive weeks, probably without noticing a dent in income (yes, they do this occasionally, so make sure they're open before making a special trip). The place is super small, and weekend lines are known to stretch all the way down Roscoe (and then some). Get there early, and you still may have to wait. Check it out during the week - lines can still be long, but instead of waiting three hours, you may only have to wait one. And the duck fat fries - unique and good, but save all the room in your stomach for the sausage. The best idea is to get a couple sausages each and share, thus experiencing more of what Hot Doug's has to offer. Last time we were here, we tried the classic Chicago dog, the Rib Eye, Alligator with Shrimp Remoulade, and Sonoran dog (very spicy). They were all amazing and I will never forget the phenomenal taste from the Sonoran dog."
1526,"The more I look at my reviews, the more I feel like an old, angst-filled hater of all things that people love. I just don't get it. First of all, I don't feel like I should have to build my schedule around eating a hot dog. It's rarely open, and every time I've tried to pop in it's got a line out the door. The dogs are pretty good, but the fries are grease-soaked and usually limp. Drink refills aren't free. The place is fine, just annoying. Every time someone from out of town brings a lonely planet or AAA traveler's guide, I have to go again. Two Stars"
1527,"The foie gras with duck sausage dog RULED. So did the Elvis Dog (although Portillos still has the best Chicago Dog). The venison and cherry dog with smoked cheese was too sweet for my girlfriend, but I thought it was ""interesting"" but it needed an acid to cut through the richness. Doug waited on us his own damn self and couldn't have been nicer. It was a sausage fest in the best sense of the word. Encased meats? Don't mind if I do."
1528,"What can I say................. THE BEST MOST CREATIVE dogs around!!!!!! Great, speedy service. Almost always a long line, but DEFINITELY worth the wait!"
1529,"What a quirky, kitschy place to grab a dog. Beware-the lines get LONG. I usually order off the daily specials listing. Sure you can get a regular old dog, but that is not why you come here! Doug is always manning the cash register and is very friendly. Fries are freaking delicious as well. I love the decor of this place oh so much. I recommend eating your dogs there! It's just one of the places I miss so much. Can't he come to Denver, PLEASE??"
1530,"So I never really know what to make of those places that get featured in one of those Food Network shows like ""Best of...[insert city name here]."" But I saw ""Hot Doug's"" featured on one of those types of shows and it stuck with me because they had crazy things like Ostrich sausages, etc. Maybe I made that up. Anyway, I just knew that I had to try it. Along with everyone else and their mothers, of course. The line was about 2hrs long. But strangely, it wasn't all tourists. There were definitely a good number of locals in that line. I guess in my mind, Hot Doug's line was sort of analogous to the Shake Shack line. And I am very glad we waited in that line. We ordered the celebrity sausage of the day which was a knackwurst with cheese on the inside and outside, a ""Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Beer-Washed Truckle Cheese,"" and of course, a large order of their fresh-cut fries. It was my first elk experience. It was delicious. You could definitely taste the smokiness of the knackwurst which I thought was a very nice touch given that both sausages were char-grilled. The table next to us ordered maybe about 3 different types of sausages/hot dogs per person, which we should've done and will do the next time I am in Chi. Finding a table/seating was also NOT difficult at all despite the huge crowd. I also thoroughly enjoyed all the kitchsy hot dog products and paraphenalia. Definitely worth the line."
1531,"Oh yeah baby, got the sausage topped with foie gras w/ truffle aioli. Yum. Loved the foie gras so much I just couldn't focus much on the sausage. Hubby had the garlic sausage topped with roasted, moist, soft garlic and havarti cheese chunks. That was REALLY delicious too. Of course, duck fat fries which are so yummy without condiments. Since the wait's so long (2.5 @#$#@ hours on a Saturday), most people end up ordering multiple hot dogs per person to justify the wait. Very nice owner. No seating until you've ordered your food. If you get a regular dog, why bother? Go somewhere else. There are other places that do basic Chicago-style char-dogs better."
1532,"After watching Anthony Bourdain rave about Hot Doug's, I booke a flight and flew to Chicago to see what all the hype was about....It was good, but not great. I gave it a fair chance though. I tried 5 different hot dogs & the duck fat fries: The Chicago Style Hot Dog The Keira Knightly - fire dog Paul Kelly - bratwurst soaked in beer The Dave Kingman - chicken sausage sante fe style The Elvis - polish sausage The BEST was by far the Paul Kelly & Keira Knightly....full of flavor! The others just tasted like boring Oscar Meyer weiners you could buy at your local grocery store. The duck fat fries were delicious though. Then again anything fried in fat & has the ability to clog your arteries is always happy on the taste buds. The line is super long ( I waited 45min), but it should be expected. Overall it was good, but not great."
1533,"After a year of reading rave reviews about Hot Doug's, I finally had a moment and I checked it out today. It was 10 degrees. Pretty cold if you ask me. My toes are still frozen! I waited in line with an unemployed lawyer and a culinary school student - very delightful people who helped me figure things out before we got to the register. I believe I waited about 20 or 30 minutes but the line was short so most of it was in the vestibule and inside the joint. Doug was very courteous as were all of his employees. He runs a tight shift. Very organized. I ordered a grilled dog with everything and sport peppers, fries and the gourmet sausage: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris ($9.00 - pretty pricey but I really wanted to try Foie Gras). Now, I really love liver, I understand Foie Gras is very different than you everyday, run of the mill fried liver, but this, really wasn't good. I think I hurried into the extreme and I should of taken it slow and tried a fire dog or something on the regular menu before moving to such advanced culinary delights. Totally un-delightful for me. Didn't care for the sausage at all. There was something off about it. Not sure. I can't really compare to any other times since this was a first for me. The Dog though was great! The sport peppers were so perfect and the fries were really good too. I like the ketchup bottles at the table so that I can pour as much as possible on my fries. Yum! Why 3 stars? Although the hot dog was great and the fries were good, had I stopped at that, I may bump it up to 4 stars but being that the sausage was $9 and tasted like a greasy mess, 3 stars is being generous. I'll definitely go back, and try something else. I should of tried the Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy White Peach Mayonnaise, Creme de Brie Cheese and Roasted Plantains, oh well. No biggie. A 3 is pretty good score. You don't need to have a 4 and 5 all the time to be perfectly good."
1534,"God bless America. And Hot Dogs and Hot Doug's. So to start off be prepared to wait. I figured by going after the lunch crowd we could get our order in 20 minutes or less. Boy was i wrong. Total time was 2 hours: 45 minutes of waiting outside in the cold, 5-10min on the order, and the rest of the time enjoying the wonderful goodness of the specialty dogs/sausage. Don't forget your cash and if it's winter wear a warm jacket, a hat and some gloves. I saw a lot of undressed people who were popsicles by the time they got inside."
1535,"PERFECTION. I never thought I could enjoy hot dogs in such a way. I am not even that big of a hot dog eating fan. Coming here, has made me want to try some hot dog spots in NYC that I never thought about going to. It was by far my favorite meal for the entire 4 day trip I took to Chicago early March. To this day, I find myself craving these bad boys. And those cheese fries...yum. They weren't even the much talked about duck fat fries yet still - amazing. We went on a Thursday afternoon - so no huge line and we had no problem scoring a seat. Service was super friendly. When we changed our mind and went back up to ask for cheese on the fries - there was no extra charge. Since we never been before - and we don't live in Chicago we decided to get 4 hot dogs so we could sample as much as possible. My favorite...not sure of the name but it had green olives, goat cheese and some tasty sauce. The combination was delicious. Anyway - there's tons of reviews all saying the same thing -- so just go :)"
1536,"The first stop of my ""Back from Hawaii"" Food Tour is, no doubt about it, Hot Doug's! As soon as I landed at O'Hare Airport after a 9-hour flight, I was starving! With over 1,000 reviews I'll keep it sweet and simple. Got there as soon as the place opened at 10:30am on a Friday, and there was already a line forming! I ordered the Chicago Hot Dog and fries fried in duck fat (served Friday and Saturday ONLY)! Delish- reason why I love Chicago so much! I've also tried The Salma Hayek and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli. Be adventurous try'em all! Remember to check the website or call in to see if they are open. I've learned my lesson."
1537,"I've been to doug's a couple times. I've had the Chicago Dog, a couple of celeb specials, and the thai sausage one. I'm sad to say... I am not that impressed. They are good hot dogs, but I don't find them amazing. Actually, I think I like the Chicago dog best, maybe i'm just a chicago dog type chick. However, note to others, I went on a monday at 1:30 pm and was out of there by 2, including line and eating. What up!!!!!!!!"
1538,"What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said in 1,200+ reviews? Hmm, I could say that I wasn't very impressed with the andouille sausage that I split with my wife. I thought it tasted like dirty water; she just didn't like it, period. It also wasn't spicy at all, despite the warnings. The owner was very helpful, though, in telling me the best toppings to go with it. I also got a polish (with mustard and sauerkraut) for myself and enjoyed it thoroughly; my wife got a hot dog with all the toppings (except tomato) and loved it too. Their fries are also very good. I didn't go on one of the days that they serve duck fat fries, though, which is a shame. I would have liked to try them. So, despite the lackluster andouille, I liked this place a lot. And the price for everything is fantastic, too."
1539,"I've been wanting to try Hot Dougs for a while now, and carefully made plans to do so when I had an open (friday or saturday) afternoon that I didn't mind spending 2 hours waiting for dogs with a good friend to catch up with. So yesterday I made the hour long walk to Avondale (""the place where people like to wait"" my new avondale slogan) and met up with Mal N. We waited about an hour and a half, which was fine, it wasn't too hot out, and when we-at last- made it to the front I ordered the foie gras duck sausage dog, a corn dog and split an order of duck fat fries with Mal. The wait to get out food wasn't long, and I dug into my much anticipated duck dog. The first bite was great. A melody of flavors. The second bite was still good, but I was starting to get weighed down with the richness. And half way through the third bite I didn't even want to swallow. It was so rich, and the techtures started to really freak me out...too mushy, the sausage too bouncy(?). So I only ate half of it. My corn dog was good, but with me corndogs are pass/fail, so not too special, the special comes in the specialty dogs, which I wish I would have picked something else (although I know this was my ""gotta try"" so I'm glad it's outta the way). On to the duck fat fries. They were....fine. Not at all bad, but I like good regular fries better. I will never be back to Dougs on a fri or a sat simply because the fries make the wait at least 45 mins longer, and they aren't worth it...in fact if I was offered a choice between duck fat fries and regular, with no wait, right here on my couch, I will always choose the regular. So Dougs gets 3 stars. I do not regret my experience (although I did feel like vomiting a bit on my way home-too much!) but I won't repeat it. I will be back though, on a weekday, and I won't get the foie gras. Maybe that'll bumb it up to 4 stars...cause that's what I think it probably derserves, but based on my experience I really can't do more. I mean, I didn't finish my special $9 dog and the fries we meh and I waited an hour and a half. Gimme a break! oh avondale, I don't understand you very well."
1540,Any type of hotdog imaginable is available. This is place has it all. Menu changes periodically so give whatever catchs your eye a try. There is line because it is so damn good but well worth the wait. Lomo Dog is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
1541,"This place is awesome, but not really worth coming to town and waiting in line an hour for. All the regular menu items that I had would make me come here again and again if this place weren't so freaking busy, but I can't say so much of the more unique items here. When I first heard of duck fat fries, I imagined french fries that tasted like... duck! (think taking a bit of crispy duck skin.... auuuughhh....) Alas, my initial impressions were dashed as we tried both the duck fat fries and the regular fries together and though we could tell a difference, we all agreed that the difference wasn't enough for us to consider this a must-have. Onto the specialty sausages... after having tried a crayfish sausage and mushroom/pork sausage, I was pretty unimpressed. The crayfish tasted like an andouille sausage to me, cept more expensive. I expected to see chunks of shrooms in my shroom/pork sausage, but, to my dismay, none was to be found. What most impressed, however, was how the people serving the food and the guy taking the order were really chill. Any request I had, despite the insane business, was handled amazingly well. If I lived near here I'd probably come here right when it opens or something. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to wait until all the hype dies down before coming here again"
1542,"It is like an orgasm in your mouth! - Quote from a guy in line...What the hell?!? I finally took the plunge and waited in line one early winter Saturday morning with my buddy. He was telling me how good the Duck Dog was (aka Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel). I was sold, but then this dude in front of us overhears the Duck Dog comment and says, ""It is like an orgasm in your mouth!"" No joke. I think he realized what he just said, and then it got really awkward and quiet. Even with that weird comment at my first Hot Doug's experience, I was hooked. The Duck Dog is my favorite food in the city! I have to balance it with another specialty dog...any of them will do, they are all fantastic. Eating just the Duck is so rich and delicious, you just have to have another dog. Doug is great, sometimes a little too chatty when you're freezing outside and waiting to step through the doors. But I thank him for this great place. I crave Doug's once a month, and have gone at least a dozen times since that first awkward experience! If I could only fix the waiting in line part! The best time to go is on a Tuesday/Wednesday around 11 AM. No line, just bliss."
1543,"What is left to say that hasn't already been said? Here are the highlights: - $9 duck sausage topped with foie gras and sauternes sauce. Quite frankly, the best sausage I've ever had. - Insanely delicious french fries, duck fat or regular. - A timeline of encased meat ""history"" on the wall. A true work of art. I planned for a year to get to this place on our recent cross-country road trip and I was not disappointed. We stood on line for 45 minutes and it was worth every second. If you're in Chicago, pay Doug a visit."
1544,"Visited Doug today. It's been over 3-4 years since the last time I had a hot dog from here. Due to all the yelp craziness over this place, I decided to give it a go since I couldn't remember what I thought of it the first time. We made sure we got there when they opened so we could avoid the crowds. It took about 15 minutes :) We tried the regular brat, foie gras duck sausage and the selma hayk which is the andouille sausage with fries. I was so excited to try the foie gras duck and sadly i was very disappointed. First i couldnt believe I was dropping $9 for a ""hot dog"". Second, it didnt even taste that great. If I had to wait over 15 minutes and since the food wasn't that great, I would have been pretty upset. I honestly do not think this was worth all the calories... sorry hot dougs."
1545,"The food is amazing. I live in NJ now, but everytime I'm in Chicago, I try to visit Hot Dougs. I have tried many of the hot dogs, but I now exclusively order the Duck and Foie Gras with cheese fries. The rich combination makes me so incredibly happy and I salivate just thinking about it. I would give this place 5 stars except that going there is always a big ""to do."" Hours are short and lines are long."
1546,"I had a half day off work for Good Friday, so I had what I believed to be a brilliant idea... why not run over to Hot Doug's for lunch? Tragically: 1 - None of my friends were able to join 2 - I didn't have a book or magazine with me 3 - I was wearing open-toed shoes and it was quite windy and freezing cold 4 - Everyone in the greater Chicagoland area had the same idea as I did, so the line ended up being almost 2 hours start to finish... Once I got inside, of course, all of the anger and frustration went away, and I regained the ability to wiggle my fingers and toes. I went with a traditional Chicago dog, duck fat fries, and a Spicy Jerk Sausage that had fried plantains, brie, and a passion fruit mayonnaise. I couldn't actually distinguish the taste of the mayo but the plantains were a GREAT touch. Hot Doug's has a great classic dog - it's got the ""snap"" and is super cheap...less than $2. The duck fries are delicious and all, but honestly, I think it's better to go to Hot Doug's during the week (non-duck days) because the line's a bit more manageable. Whatever day you decide to go, be ready to devote a good chunk of your afternoon to the anticipation and consumption of sausages. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does require advance planning."
1547,"Hot Doug's is a legit five-star encased meat establishment. I have been wanting to visit Hot Doug's since moving to Chicago at the beginning of 2010. I finally had the opportunity to visit, and I am so glad that I did. First off, expect a line! I chose to visit Hot Doug's on a Friday for lunch to ensure that I could splurge on the duck fat fries (yes...fries cooked in duck fat are available on Fri and Sat only). Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed them and likely shaved at least a few minutes off of my life expectancy. Now for the ""encased meats..."" My wife and I ordered 4 different items so we could try a wide array. We tried two regular menu items: The Salma Hayek (andouille sausage) was delicious, but a bit greasy. The Keira Knightley (red hot) was excellent. We also tried two specials: An antelope sausage and a crawfish sausage. I really wish I could remember all of the ingredients and the official names. In the end, they were all very tasty. Hot Doug's rocks! Again...expect a line, be adventurous when ordering, and bring cash (no CCs accepted). I look forward to my next visit to Hot Doug's."
1548,"If there was a six star rating, I would have given it. My husband and I ordered two hot dogs each (please don't judge us), and the duck fat fries....I had not one ounce of eaters remorse, only regret that I didn't order three...:-D I'm just sayin!!! I've been here twice now, I'd come more often but I live in the burbs. I did especially love the Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage, I had it both times I went. Who new hot dogs could be so classy. Expect to wait in line 30-40 minutes, it's not hype, it's edible art and Doug is a master."
1549,"Doug is a culinary genius. He manages to find an excellent flavor combination for even the most exotic meats. It's refreshing to see someone who understands the subtleties of a particular meat or cheese, and who finds new and interesting ways to bring those subtleties out. I can gush and gush for pages, but there's really no way to accurately describe it, you simply must go there and taste for yourself. The menu on the website is ALWAYS up to date, which is something that I really, really, really appreciate. They take several vacations a year, which are always posted well ahead of time. It's an extra step that most eateries don't take, and it really shows that he's in it for the love of encased meats, and not just for money. BYOB, which would be even more awesome if they were open for dinner. Smallish, purposefully kitschy building with a small outdoor patio. Huge crowds from the nearby offices at lunchtime (so get there before noon!). It's the ultimate Chicago sausage experience. Get thee to Doug's!"
1550,"If you're from NYC and love Crif Dogs or from California and love Top Dog in Berkeley then you'll love Hot Doug's. We waited in line for nearly an hour out in the freeeeezing cold. Despite having two pairs of ski socks on, my toes were frozen and numb by the time we got inside. The wait was definitely worth it though. They have a really extensive and innovative menu of sausages that all sounded great. I ended up getting the mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken sausage, which was delish. We also shared an order of the duck fat fries (only served on the weekends) which were heavenly. Also, apparently the restaurant's eponym, Doug, was the person taking orders at the register. He was really friendly and it's great to see that he's working upfront and interacting with the patrons."
1551,"Yeah, pointless to write a review of this place, I know. Seriously, I've had better hot dogs elsewhere. I'm not the sausage adventure type so I got a regular dog (after waiting eons in line of course). If you can't make a regular dog the schnizzle, I can't say I'm all that motivated to go back to try anything else. And their fries weren't even all that stellar. It seems just because it's so popular, everyone thinks they have to love it. Hm, over-rated. You have to devote a whole day to getting food from there since it takes forever to get in. Not worth the line. The hot dogs & fries at Tore's at Diversey and Western are far better."
1552,"My fianc and I used to go to Hot Doug's when it was on the other side of the river on Roscoe and Western. We would go 3X a week for lunch when we were in high school. After the fire, we were incredibly disappointed because Hot Doug's seriously has some amazing dogs! A few years ago however, I was back on break and randomly driving down California when I had discovered that Hot Doug's had risen from the ashes! Whenever i'm in the area I always try to stop in, especially for the duck fat fries--YUM! The only bummer: be prepared to wait in uber-long lines. Hot Doug's has become quite the celebrity among chicago hot dog places. Not entirely worth the wait if you're just getting a chicago dog, but definitely worth it if you're going to try one of the specialty sausages and meats."
1553,The King of Hot Dogs and everyone knows it. Creative and imaginative hot dogs with a captivated audience of devoted followers flock here daily. Exceptional fries cooked to perfection. Awesome totally!
1554,"Dont ever try this. It has been 6 months since Ive been to Hot Dougs and now Im craving it so bad that Im coming up with schemes on how to beat the system. Look, Ive eaten here before. I know the drill. I know how awesome it is and I know how long it fu**ing takes. That being said I tried to get sneaky. Knowing full well that they close at 4pm. I showed up at 4 thinking I could get in quick. The line was still half way down the block so I decided to wait and come back at 5 (1 hour after they were closed). When I showed up the line was almost gone. I was so fired up. I parked and walked up and got in line. Thats when I got bitched slapped. Hot Dougs must have an employee that waits at the end of the line once they are closed because he stopped me and informed me that they were closed. What a drag. I thought I was onto something. Now I am craving this place like hell and I just dont want to wait 2 hours."
1555,"I'll take the specials. Which one he asks? I'll take all of them. Our journey began at 11:20am on Friday. We went from discussing 1 dog each to an hour and half later ending up with 3 dogs each (12 total) and a couple of orders of duck fat fries. If you don't want to binge, absolutely don't talk about what you should eat during the long wait. The mindset becomes we waited this long and when are we going to be back - order it all. My highlights were the following: - The Fois Gras hot dog but wish the fois gras was prepared hot. - The smoked shrimp and pork was good. Word of advice; remove some (not all) of the blue cheese; you'll feel better about yourself because you saved about 300 calories. Your going to be full the entire day unless your my friend, who managed to put away a quarter pound value meal and a pastrami sandwich in a span of 15 minutes in the wee hours of the morning. He must have been talking to himself while waiting for us to get post partying food - he definitely has a tendency to binge :)."
1556,"I'm with Vincent - Doug deserves it - but I can't match Vincent on the length of review. Hot Doug's deserves all of the praise and all of the long lines on Saturdays. No matter what, it's a fun time out for a bit of fun food. I agree with all of the raves on the specialty encased meats, but for me, I love Hot Doug's because it's a classic full-blown Chicago hot dog done perfectly. Give me one with everything, and don't forget the celery salt."
1557,"People complain about the line. People complain about the prices. I'm not going to. Sure if you're in a hurry, go to Al's beef or something. There's a line because the guy taking your order actually takes the time to be a little personable with customers. He seemed to remember regulars and was an ace at small talk. Go with friends. It makes the wait in line seem shorter. I had a blue cheese polish w/ almonds and some apple-sauce type stuff. Sounds weird, but it was totally delicious..and HUGE. I almost didn't have room for for my Elvis dog. Almost. Those two dogs and a small fountain drink....""Eh $10 should cover it"" is what the man charged me. I could barely walk out the door because I was so full, so I don't feel like it was that expensive. If you get the small fries, there's enough to share w/ 2 or 3 people. I think the pacing of the line also allows enough turnover time to get a table inside. They have cool bubble-like mirrors. Woulda been five stars but w/ their hours only time I can go is on Saturdays. I'm bitter because I want more. 7/52"
1558,"I like my sausages--you know bratwurst, polish, the occasional hot dog during a nice hot summer day bbq...but Hot Doug's really bring sausage...aka encased meat....to a new level. I was told that you wait in line outside. Hmmm...waiting outside on a 25 degree day in Chicago in December? All I could think was, this better be worth it. So, you wait in line, you get inside and peruse the menu. I kinda felt like I was in the circus with all the bright colors, and wondered if the normal looking picture of Britney Spears meant that she had been there pre-baby/craziness? BUT---on the menu---all different kinds of sausage that you never could imagine. I had the pork cheddarwurst--which was a special sausage of the day. It was so good, it had cheddar oozing out of it, white cheddar on top of it and some sort of delicious sauce/mayo on top. Also split the duck-fat fries--yes that's right--duck fat. They only have them on Fridays and Saturdays, but they are good. Pretty much you shouldn't eat anything the rest of the day because a sausage and fries complete your daily allotment of fat and calories...haha Three people could definitly split an order of fries. The staff was friendly. I know I appreciated the fact that there was a place to sit when the food came out. There was one guy who quickly wiped off tables and directed waiting people where they could sit."
1559,"Doug's is the best!!! The meats are tasty and varied, and the toppings really bring out the flavor. There are like 5 or 6 specialty sausages I love the most - can't pick just one. Duck fat fry-days are a can't miss! Doug and staff are real cool and down to earth. If I had to mention a downside, it's the popularity of the place. You'll have to wait 45mins-1hr to get in on Saturdays, or at peak lunch time. The place is real small, so not too many people can fit at once. I try to get there at 10:45 or 11 on weekdays, to avoid the rush. You can actually hang out and talk to Doug at these times. But if you put it in perspective, all the top Chicago places have long lines. Frontera Grill and Cafe Iberico come to mind - and you have to wait 1-2hrs for these places!"
1560,"There are no two finer words in the English language than encased meats,"" my friend."" This was the last place in Chicago I hit up before heading east again on my road trip. Boy, am I glad I took the time to stop by! We got there at about one on a Wednesday, but by the look at the line coming out the door, you would think we hit lunch rush on a Friday. I heard a rumor that they had a foie gras hot dog, which I had to try. It took almost a half hour before we got to order, so it gave us plenty of time to decide which hot dogs we would order. Because it was a Wednesday, I was not able to try the fries fried in duck fat, but they were serving the foie gras dog, $9. That was the only hot dog I ordered, but I was fortunate enough that my sisters both ordered two different dogs each and we shared an order of the crinkle cut cheese fries. All our hot dogs were amazing! The foie gras dog was actually a duck sausage served with a mousse and foie gras sprinkled on top with sel gris on top of that. The bun was special too! It was the most amazing hot dog I've ever had in my life! I'm bummed that I can't treat myself to one anytime I've had a bad day. I also got to try the Chicago dog-hot dog, pickle spear, neon green relish, mustard, tomato and celery salt-which was fantastic! There are some pretty awesome hot dog places in Portland, but none of them compares to Hot Doug's!"
1561,"In a city overflowing with a wide range of culinary choices, Hot Doug's is the one place I make an effort to visit every time I'm in the Windy City. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's very affordable, the staff is really personable and for a place that basically just sells hot dogs and fries, the flavor combinations that this place produces always brings a big old smile to my face. There is a thoughtfulness that goes into designing these dogs that brings what is often thought as street food to a gourmet level. I'm the adventurous type of diner, so I'm always leaning towards the fancier dogs, although I had a corn dog there once and that was a decidedly wise $1.50 spent. Because they have so many choices that I find appealing I use the strategy of going with a friend, ordering 2 dogs each and then splitting them up, so that we can each taste 4 different sausages. I always go for the wild game dog too and it has yet to disappoint me. There is always a line going out the door at this place, but regardless it seems to move pretty quickly. From my experience I suggest limiting yourself to two dogs per person. Anything beyond that will take it's toll."
1562,"Hot Doug's is a delicious cased-meat emporium. Even his hot dogs are considerably better than most other places. But the real beauty of the place is the unusual and mostly delicious concoctions Doug creates. The staff is very friendly, and Doug himself is always there. Friendly and personable, he often suggests getting the small drink with free refills if you're dining in. Some of the selections can be a bit pricey, but I think they're worth every penny. Doug's is a great establishment with great people working there. What more can you ask for?"
1563,"Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I tried the wrong thing. Either way, I'm not in a hurry to return and give Hot Doug's a chance to change my middling first impression. I went on a Tuesday around 3 p.m., so the line wasn't too bad (and may even have been longer than usual because it was Election Day). I took note of the punk rock blasting over the speakers and the kitschy, irreverent decor without particular enjoyment or dislike, although I did appreciate the giant faux-Magritte painting of Hot Doug's signature sausage captioned ""ceci n'est pas une hot-dog"" hanging in the men's bathroom. Determined to forgo the standard offerings for a more exotic special, I initially settled on the beef Landjaeger with chili-garlic mustard and smoked Gouda. As much as I hate to admit it, though, the $5.00 price tag, low in comparison with the other specials, made me think I'd be missing out if I didn't upgrade to something more luxurious. I switched to the Portuguese Linguia with smoked paprika dijonnaise and Castelinhos cheese for $7.50. I skipped the fries, which many of you may consider an insane, inexcusable offense. Maybe I will try them at some point. The sausage harmonized well with the dijonnaise and the white, sharpish cheese, which half-melted into a slightly coarse, spreadable goo. The bun was probably the best I've had with anything hot dog related. The thing is, it didn't transcend, didn't become something greater than the sum of its parts as my mouth chomped it all together. It didn't have nearly the same effect for me as something like a burger at Kuma's, which is practically right around the corner and shares both a subculture aesthetic and a fixation on meat. The sausage was solid, good, but by no means excellent. One of my strongest beliefs about food is that you should be able to make something that's more than just good when you're throwing fat around like Pollock used paint. I will admit that I'm not a huge sausage or encased meat person in general, but I don't think the onus of my disappointment lies in the fact that I don't go apeshit for hot dogs. I suppose I owe Hot Doug's at least a sample of one of its more bread-and-butter offerings, but I'm just not that motivated to after my first experience; the thing that's most likely to influence me to return is the Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda they keep in the cooler."
1564,A.D.I.D.A.H.D. All day i dream about hot dougs.
1565,"I ordered the Smoked Gouda, Apple-Chicken-Sausage, and a side of Chili Cheese Fries. All that and a soda for only $10! Super awesome choices for hot dogs. They have a special odd meet up each week like Rattle Snake and fry items in duck fat on some days. You gotta love this place. it's an excellent landmark that everyone should visit when they come to Chicago. The only downside is the line to get in is always no less than a city block long. :)"
1566,"It's undeniable. Hot Doug's cannot be beat in the game of encased meats. The epic lines make that obvious. If at all possible, try to go early on a weekday. The line is more bearable then. But even if you have to wait forever, the dogs are worth it. Suck it up, you won't be sorry. The specials are a thing of beauty. I ordered the smoked shrimp and pork sausage topped with a Cajun remoulade and huge chunks of blue cheese. Spicy, creamy, out of this world. And the foie-topped duck sausage is probably the most insanely decadent thing you could ever put in your body. And if that's not enough for you, the people who work here are the friendliest damn people I have ever encountered in the food industry. That's it. I'm moving to Chicago."
1567,"I will be completely honest in this posting. This is a fantastic find - except the lines are typically out the door (can you say 'New Location' please?). Their specialty dogs are the best - and they always have something new up their sleeve. On top of all this, the guy taking your money (cash only!) is Doug himself. And to show you the dedication that he has to the quality of service, he shut down the store when he broke his leg a few months back. This place is great, but I end up in the bathroom for an hour every time I eat here. Why doug? Why? Im not blaming you, Im blaming my celiac family. Damn wheat."
1568,Loooong lines and its more then worth it. The king of cased meats! The Polish - Amazing The Kielbasa - Amazinger The Char dog and caramelized onions - Amazingest! Every time I have been there Doug has been there and he greats the long lines with a smile. I wish I lived nearer or they would open a Hot Doug's in Wriggly!
1569,"I was in Chicago a few weeks ago. My husband went for work, I tagged along. So on the day he had a work event, I had nothing planned. Sometimes I just love to wander around a city by myself. I had offers from my mother in law to go shopping but something that day just said ""Go on a solo mission"". I google mapped Hot Doug's after hearing so much about them and got myself to the Blue Line (was staying in a hotel downtown). Got on the bus and got off at Hot Doug's. There was a long ass line around the corner of the building. I went to the back of the line. Wow this place must be really good. So I stood in line for about 25 minutes while chit chatting with my neighbours in line. I finally got towards the menu and I wanted 2 hot dogs but I knew I wouldn't be able to have both since it was Saturday and I intended on having the duck fat fries. I ended up choosing the Kobe Cincy Dog with the fries and a drink. I even got a picture with Doug while in line. The hot dog was amazing. I usually feel ill after eating dogs but this time did not give me the ill feeling. I wish I could have tried the Jerk hot dog. I love Caribbean flavours. All of the specials sounded great. And I spent $11 with tip. Amazing! I love how Chicagoans takes food to the next level even when it's something as simple as a hot dog. Oh and if you aren't usually in that neighbourhood, I suggest calling them to see if they are open. I think they take holidays off, etc. I think if Doug is not there, the place is closed. They are only open till 4pm on the days they are open."
1570,"What a great place. If I lived in Chicago, I would go to Hot Doug's every week to try out everything on the menu! After reading about possible LONG lines, my friend and I arrived at Hot Doug's on Thursday around 11:15. The good thing was that we only had to wait for 10 min. to place our order and the obvious bad thing was that no duck fat fries were served on Thursday. Two dogs and fries, plus sodas for less than $15. The regular fries were okay, but both sausages (pork with garlic / chicken with rosemary) were heavenly. Wow... I may actually like Hot Doug's more than Rosamunde in SF. Hmmmm... Definitely going back when I return to Chicago, hopefully in May."
1571,"First off, the prices are great and the owner is incredibly friendly. We tried the Chicago Dog and a fancier sausage. The Chicago Dog was tasty, and only $1.75, but the toppings were a little light compared to other places I've been. The fancier sausage we had was good, but it was hard to taste anything listed in the description except sausage. We went on a Monday, so no duck fat fries. The cheese fries were ok, nothing to write home about."
1572,"There is no finer establishment in the entire city of Chicago than Hot Doug's. I would eat here every day, if I could ... it's really that simple."
1573,"I love Hot Doug. I think hot dogs are gross ( I found a bone in an Oscar Mayer once) but I still love this place. One of my friends used to work for Doug and I know for a fact that he treats his employees really well, so I completely support his establishment--even if I do stick to the meatless dogs (which are, for real, the best around). I'd love to see him back over in his old hood, though. His place was such a nice fit."
1574,"I have been a fan of the Hot Dog for quite some time now. I stop in little loints all the time looking for the perfect dog. Many have come close, but I seem to have finally found what I have been looking for. Simply put, Hot Doug's has the best Chicago Style red hots in the city -- period. I have been there six times now and the place never disappoints. Poppyseed buns, a wide array of topping options (including kraut!), and you can get your dogs charred, steamed, or fried. And be warned, a large order of fries is more than enough for two people to share. If you go there during prime lunch hour, be prepared to wait in a line that might stretch out the door and up the block. Don't worry, it's worth the wait! Better yet, go in after 2pm and the line will be much easier to manage. Doug also has some other great sausages as well, including some fantastic daily specials that you won't find anywhere else. (Rabbit or Wild Boar sausage anyone?) On top of the great food, the way the place is decorated is a hoot. Doug has a sense of humor and it shows. I love this place and I think every hot dog lover should try it. Just remember, it's all about hot dogs and other sausages, so don't go there expecting a beef stand menu with burgers, beef sandwiches, and salads. It's all about the encased meats here. I think Doug makes a vegetarian friendly sausage, but it's a pretty much all meat menu. Thanks for the best hot dogs in Chicago, my friend!"
1575,"If you are a first timer to Hot Doug's, go on a Saturday so you can suckle on the teet of Duck Fat Fries. The BEST fries you will ever taste (and i love to get a side of cheese as well). I have been to Hot Doug's over a dozen times and have never ordered the same thing. I haven't even had anything on the regular menu because the specials are impossible to turn down. If you live in the city, put this on your list of ""musts."" Its surely a place you'll take all your out of town visitors. Do not be discouraged by the line. It moves pretty quickly and is absolutely worth it."
1576,Plain and simple this place rocks. Be ready to wait in line but it is well worth it. Bacon is meat candy.
1577,"Hot Doug's is pretty good, although it's super annoying that they're not open more. If I had such a successful business, though, I'd probably not want to work often either. It's also not really in an area that'd get much nightly passer's by. I really appreciated the cognac infused pheasant dog. Wow. I can't go without snagging one of the Italian sausages (Luca Brasi, I think it's called). This place is a must for chubby visitors. :)"
1578,"Don't kill me for not giving it five stars... So I took my dad here in February, he had no idea what it was and we waited in line for over an hour. I swore after that I would never go back because it was just OK.... But when a avid foodie friend came to visit he insisted that we needed to go. You would have thought I learned my ""line"" lesson the first time but no, we ended up waiting almost two hours. I don't know if it was the excitement of my guest, my grumbling stomach or the fact that it was really great but the second time was AMAZING. Almost well worth the wait. The duck fat fries are wonderful and the dogs are original and delish. The line maybe the only downfall but it can be avoided if you get there early!"
1579,"Hot Doug's is consistently one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The reason why this place is so good is because the specials (and when you go, you'll want to order at least two sausages off the specials menu) are some of the most inspired dishes I've ever seen in my life. Don't waste your time on the hot dogs and regular sausages. I'm sure they're all good, but they're nothing like the specials. As of July 2, 2010, here are just a few things on the menu at Hot Doug's: Rosemary and Garlic Smoked Chicken Sausage with Sweet Chili-Garlic Mustard and Cheese-Stuffed Marinated Hot Peppers Spinach, Mozzarella and Pepperoni Pork Sausage with Pesto Genovese, Roma Tomatoes and Gran Cascina Pecorino Cheese Hot Doug's BLT: Bacon Sausage with Avocado Mayonnaise, Iceberg Lettuce, Cherry Tomatoes and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese Once in a while, you'll get a special that seems somewhat lacking - either the flavors promised in the sauce will not jump out all that much, or the sauce will seem flat, or something. But even then the food will seem pretty good. And then it's great, as it was for example when they were selling the Teuben (a Reuben sandwich as a sausage), it'll blow your mind. Hot Doug's is cash-only, so keep that in mind when you go. I honestly think the ideal thing to get is two specials per person, and then if it's Friday or Saturday, split some of the duck fat-fried french fries. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to drive up to the northwest side of Chicago."
1580,"It took me four years to try Hot Doug's. Why? There was something about gourmet encased meats that didn't appeal to me. Well, I was SO wrong! This place was absolutely delicious. My mouth is still watering just writing about it. My cousin was visiting from Pennsylvania and numerous friends suggested that I take him to Hot Doug's. We drove over on a Saturday at noon (surprisingly, street parking was easy) and the line was around the block -- a good sign that this place was something special. Once we got to the front of the line, about 45 minutes later, we were greeted by Doug himself. He couldn't have been nicer; greeted everyone coming in and thanked everyone leaving. We noticed that Hot Doug's was cash only and so we only had enough for two dogs. We chose the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut and the Hot Sauce Chicken Sausage with ""Buffalo"" Mustard and Smoked Moody Blue Cheese. Doug asked us if we wanted anything else. We told him we were satisfied with the two dogs and then he said if cash wasn't an issue, would we like to have fries and drinks? We were shocked (and a little embarrassed) but he happily gave us their famous Duck Fat Fries and two drinks free of charge! What a guy! After we placed our order, we sat down at one of the tables inside and chowed down. This was one of the best lunches I have ever had. So much flavor. Just the right size. Fresh ingredients. Great hospitality. I can't wait to go back and try another dog! Thanks Doug!"
1581,Man oh man! Talk about duck on duck on duck action! The Foie Gras and Sauternes duck sausage hot dog was totally worth the hour and a half wait. The duck fat fries were okay...I was expecting something more flavorful but was left a little underwhelmed. Service was friendly and not rushed. People move out pretty quickly considering the capacity of the joint. Definitely something to have on your Chicago to-do list!
1582,"My boyfriend swore up and down that this was the place to go to get hotdogs. He warned me that we would probably have to wait in line for a while.....we waited about an hour. Anyone that know me, knows that I am the most impatient person in the world, so I was not excited. But I can honestly say it was worth the wait! These aren't your traditional processed wiener on a bun with some chili and cheese hot dogs. They have multiple types of sausages and toppings most people wouldn't think to put on a hot dog. There will surely be something on the menu for you! Anyone visiting Chicago looking for a gourmet hot dog needs to try Hot Doug's!"
1583,"- outrageously delicious sausage - friendly and helpful staff - short line on rainy days - free refills on fountain soda - not inexpensive I finally made it to Hot Doug's. It definitely lived up to the hype and since it was rainy, the line wasn't long. I had the Saucisson Alsacienne and duck fat fries. Loved the sausage, liked the fries (too much hype?). Also, go with a friend if you want fries, there are way too many for one person and it will cut the price."
1584,"There is nothing i can say that hasn't been said about Hot Doug's already - it's pretty much AMAZING The wait at first may turn you off, but please, it is soooo WORTH IT I would recommend definitely trying any of the specials. The regular hot dogs are also delicious, but when you've been waiting in line for almost two hours, the specials will hit the spot! The staff is also VERY friendly. Doug is always there, and always attentive to your order. The wait staff will always help you find a table for your group. also make sure you try their duck fat fries on Fridays and Saturdays!"
1585,"Duck fat fries....Check Best Dogs in Chicago... Check BYOB... Check Nothing else needs to be said. Line up, bring a beverage for the wait. And Cash."
1586,"Hot Doug's is amazing. It has just enough kitsch on the walls coupled with absolutely great weiners. Gourmet weiners. On my first visit it was probably 102 degrees heat index and Hot Doug's was not cool inside. It was freaking warm, i was definitely really sweaty. My duck and jalapeno sausage was great but it was just too hot outside to enjoy a heavy weiner. On my way home I felt nauseated and disgusted. I'm not a quitter though. I knew the deliciousness of Hot Doug's and vowed to return and I must say, when the weather dips below 70, that is the time to go for a crazy sausage. I had the pork sausage last weekend with blue cheese and it was amazing. The duck fat fries were a bit of a letdown as they imparted little duck taste, but were still delicious. I don't think they serve beer there but I wonder if I could bring one. A brat and a beer sounds pretty great right now."
1587,"This is top top hot dog place in the city. Even calling it a hot dog place is being unfair--Doug cranks out some seriously gourmet creations. The usual fare (hot dogs, polish dogs, brats) is great, but where this place really shines is the specials. The game of the week ranges from ostrich to alligator to rattlesnake and everything in between. The best part is that Hot Doug's doesn't use exotic meat for the weirdness factor: the dogs themselves are incredibly delicious. Doug's $8.00 game specials have ingredients that wouldn't be out of place in a michelin-rated restaurant. If I have one complaint, it's that the sauces he uses on the special dogs are often a little rich with butter, which can drown out the taste of the sausage. That is just quibbling, though. The bottom line is that Hot Doug's is the most innovate hot dog place I've ever seen. There is a reason people wait in line for an hour for these dogs."
1588,"Outstanding! My first experience at Hot Doug's was nearly 3 years ago, on a cold (45-degree), rainy November day. And the line stretched all the way around to the back of the building! Standing in line was an experience unto itself as groups of complete strangers would huddle under umbrellas. Myself and two friends somehow shared my gold umbrella with about 4 other people. Once inside the sights and smells were incredible. The Specials Board was just so overwhelming, and so incredible that it took well over a year before I ever touched anything on the regular menu. The duck fat fries alone are worth giving Hot Doug's 5 stars. That first day I tried to order a large drink but Doug (and Yes that is Doug) told me and my friends to get small drinks because there are free refills. That alone would have made me come back again, even if the food had been sub par. I could go on and on about this place, but there aren't enough 1's and 0's in cyberspace to hold all the data. Go for yourself and decide for yourself. Oh yeah, you can check out the specials in advance at his websie, http://www.hotdougs.com. And finally, if you like spicey, the Andouille Sausage is probably the best thing you will ever have at Hot Dougs. In fact, I rate it as the best hot dog/sausage that I have ever had."
1589,"I should preface my review by saying that I am a vegetarian, so I've only ever had the normal fries and vegetarian hot dogs here (I know, I know.) Also I have absolutely NO patience, especially when I'm hungry. However, I am totally willing to wait in line which says a lot about how amazing Hot Dougs is. I've waited anywhere from maybe 30 minutes, up to a recent almost 2 HOURS. Yes, it was about an hour and 55 minutes from the time we got in line to the time I had hot dogs in front of me. The line was brutal but as usual my rage subsided the moment I made it through the doors and knew it was almost my time. I learned my lesson about going over there on days everyone has off work (went on Good Friday) and also a lesson about not dressing warmly enough (it was FREEEZING.) The vegetarian hot dogs are the best I've ever had, and I always lust after the amazing things my meat-eating companions order. I wish they were open later and/or also open on Sundays. I also wish they would deliver to my desk right now because after typing this all I can think about is some delicious hot dogs loaded up with everything...yummm"
1590,"Holy F this place is amazing. Whatever you need to do to get there GO. Don't b*tch about waiting in line, it's annoying and I'd gladly take your place...I've waited in blizzards, sub-0 weather and blistering hot summer days with drunk Cubs fans and you don't see me complaining. I recommend the red hots and whatever Doug has on special, preferably alligator. And don't forget your CASH."
1591,"I've been here a few times, with waits ranging from 1 hr 40 min to as little as 20 min. Today, we had the: Antelope Sausage with Roasted Red Pepper-Roasted Garlic Mayonnaise and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Baby Belletoile Cheese Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel Duck fat fries The duck sausage is always the best choice (I always order it), and the duck fat fries are flavorful and have a great texture. We usually try some of the specials to experiment with new flavors. The bacon sausage wasn't very bacon-y (sad face) and the antelope sausage was pretty good. My vegetarian boyfriend really likes the Pete Shelley (vegetarian dog). I usually order it with carmelized onions and tomatoes. Recommended if you don't mind waiting in line. =]"
1592,"A tiny slice of Heaven on Earth. Doug's has some of the most fantastic food I've had anywhere, and I don't think I've ever ordered the same thing from the man himself more than once. If you manage to make it out to this little paradise and survive the line (be prepared to wait 45 min - an hour) make sure not to short change yourself and order something off the specials menu. Doug comes up with some interesting recipes, but he knows what he's doing, and I say you should trust his judgement."
1593,"There's a reason why people will wait in line for an hour in the rain/snow to eat at Hot Dougs. This place is the Mecca of hot dog joints. Where to begin? Doug greets every single one of his customers at the front counter. He clearly understands that his customers willingly sacrifice their time and patience to eat at his restaurant and he shows his appreciation to each and every one of his customers. The wait staff is also very cheerful. The atmosphere is fun and inviting. It was almost like being inside of a comic book with hot dog themed pictures and art deco on the wall. Despite the long line, there was plenty of room to sit and the place never felt crowded. 80s music plays while you dine and it helps to enhance the fun atmosphere. This isn't just another Chicago dog place. At Hot Dougs, you are privy to a weekly list of specialty encased meats that include anything from ostrich, rattlesnake, and fois gras. I ordered the Pineapple and Jalapeno Pork Sausage and split an Atomic Bomb Sausage with my brother. Both were memorable. The taste is good enough to justify spending almost 10 dollars on a hot dog. Some people might be turned away by the wait, the short hours of operation, and the cash only rule. What they need to understand is that Doug delivers in terms of taste and quality on every single facet of his business and that's what entitles him to set these rules. If you're traveling from out of town, I would put Hot Dougs high on the priority list. If you live in the Chicagoland area and haven't visited yet, you owe it to yourself to come here."
1594,"Yes, Hot Doug's has vegi hot dogs. Yes, they were the most amazing vegi dogs I've ever had. Yes, Hot Doug's is really as good as they say. Just go and wait in line. It will be worth it, I promise."
1595,"Brought a Crossword puzzle to do in line with my wife and our friend Maggie. Had the Alligator Hot Dog, Foie Gras Hot Dog and the Cranberry & Cognac Smoked Chicken Sausage. SO AWESOME! Had 2 orders of the Duck Fries with Cheese as well. Worth it. Check the Hot Dougs website so you know what you want before you go and so you know what the weekly specials are. Don't sweat the line and enjoy!"
1596,"Nom nom nom nom nom........ Worth the 45 min wait and lives up to the hype. Spectacularly delicious! I had the jerk pork sausage with mango mayo and crunchy and sweet papayas on top. Ohhhh my. The bf had the apple pork sausage with Gouda and mustard. Both were fabulous. I was happy with my choice, but probably changed my mind 4 times while waiting in line. Will definitely be back to try other sausages. I was very impressed with how much seating was available, and how fast the line moved, even though it seemed not many people left while we were waiting in line. Staff were very friendly as well. CASH ONLY though! We even waited in line for a good 10 minutes, asked someone if it was cash only (as most places in Chicago are), got out of line, drove to the nearest BOA I knew of, drove back, and got back to a much bigger line. Still worth it!!!"
1597,"nom nom nom Weekly sausages with exotic meats and duck fat fries. Drool... I've only gone on Saturday's since they close fairly early on weekdays. The line to get in usually wraps around the building and it is pretty packed once you get in, but totally worth it. I've tried pheasant, alligator, elk, rabbit, to name a few and are paired with a perfect sauce/cheese, such as foie gras or goat cheese. I haven't tried the standard Chicago hot dog yet, but I hear they are really good. Doug is always at the counter to take your order and is a super nice guy. I actually ordered a large drink and he recommended i order a small since there are free refills! Known as the encased meat emporium, they were even featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. Haven't been there in a while, but my stomach's grumbling just thinking about it now."
1598,"I'm not a big hot dog person but I gotta admit..I like this place :) I had the Salma Hayek, too bad it's not as spicy as I hoped. My friends had The Dog & The Keira Knightley and they loved it. It can get pretty expensive...$8 for a hot dog? :O"
1599,"Seriously how could you not give this place 5 stars? I was traveling on business and co-worker (based in Seattle) told me to check this place out. Well on my way to O'Hare I decided to check it out. I was not disappointed one bit. There was a small line but nothing that would turn me away. The staff was extremely friendly. I simply ordered two hot dogs and a small coke. The price was like $4.75! I almost could not believe how cheep that was! I went with everything on the dogs (except tomatoes) and loved it. I think the thing that pushes it over the edge of good to great is celery salt. The place is clean, unique and goooooooood. I would most certainly make this a must visit when in Chicago and would recommend it to others."
1600,"After waiting almost 1.5 hour on a chilly May morning, my friend and I finally got to make our order. We split the chipotle buffalo dog, spicy beef link, alligator dog, foie gras duck sausage, chicago dog, corn dog and of course the duck fat fries. Holy Crap the foie gras dog was the MOST juicy, flavorful, melt-in-your mouth delicious dog I've ever put in my mouth. That dog alone was worth the wait. The duck fat fries were good, but I seriously can't say they were that much better than other good fries. The corn dog is sweet, crunchy and delicious. The chicago dog was very standard, nothing special. The foie gras dog is 5 star plus but beyond the strangeness of the other dogs, I can't say I think they really warrant the wait."
1601,"Walking into Hot Doug's, I had pretty high expectations from all the hype. And this place definitely lived up to the hype. The foie gras with the duck sausage was incredible. To me, it was the sausage that made it great. They do put quite a bit of foie gras on there, so it makes it worth the price. This is one of the few places where I actually feel that it is worth buying a hot dog. Although the wait might be quite long, it's definitely worth the wait"
1602,"Hot diggity dog! Chicago has a few claims that no one can deny. Among them... ...crooked politicians ...cold weather ...a flippin' big lake ...damn good dogs Even New Yorkers can agree (http://leisureblogs.chic) that our dogs are the Rolls Royce of the encased meat world and while you can find a proper red hot on nearly any corner in the city, there's really only one place to complete the sausage tour d'force in a single seat. Hot Doug's. I'll leave the background to other more knowledgeable Yelpers (many of whom consider sausage a religion), but just let it be known that Doug has been making award-winning red hots since your pappy was dipping cocktail wienies. He does the classics. He does head-scratchingly bizarre. But just like grammar, you have to know the rules before you can break them. Doug does. So here's my recommendation to all visitors, whether old timers or newbies: get it all. God knows you're going to be spending an hour plus waiting in line to get in, most likely in sub-freezing temperatures (see things Chicago does well, above), so you might as well make it worth it. What I mean is (especially for newbies), you have to get Doug's take on the classic Chicago dog. You have to try an Italian sausage or Polish. Have to. From there on out, you decide how weird you want it to get. With unique takes on foreign cuisines (on my last visit I had a Thai chicken sausage with seaweed relish) and more exotic animals than you can find on an African safari (buffalo, ostrich, alligator, snake all come to mind), you're only limited to your own boundaries... or the size of your stomach. The good news is that's it's all good. From A to Z and everything in between. And if you ever find yourself lost and confused, just ask what Doug suggests. Yup, that's him right there at the register, day in and day out, preaching the gospel of the sausage who anyone willing to listen. And believe me, there are plenty."
1603,"Fast service,excellent dogs'n'sausages, and the BEST French fries, ever. Not to mention some pretty fun decor and signage. Long line, short wait, loved the heck out of it. DO NOT MISS IT."
1604,"Uhm, foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with foie gras mouse, truffle aioli and sel gris? Who has ever heard of this before? No one, really, but man, Doug was smart and brave enough to provide this, and it is good! I mean, really, any foie gras duck is treated better than the best treated battery farmed chicken which many americans eat multiple times a week. As before, coming on a weekday (well Monday-Thursday) outside of prime lunch hours will be wise, but it is very delicious!"
1605,"There are no two finer words in the English language than encased meats, my friend What can be said that hasn't been said already???? I HEART HOT DOUGS!!!! Don't be dissuaded by the long line, it's worth the wait!!! Duck Fat Fries Duck Fat Fries Duck Fat Fries Duck Fat Fries Sounds awful, but is what kept me in line outside in 99 degrees!"
1606,"There is parking. The wait is one hour (and a half). The encased meats are worth it. Bring a chair, a flask and a book. It takes me exactly 1 month to forget the wait and want to make my way back to this fantastic establishment. The uber garlic dog is my personal favorite, but my friend was just as happy w/ her chili cheese hot dog. Whatever your tastes, you'll be back in that damned line. Guaranteed."
1607,"One of my friends told me that he pretends to be sick at work so he can leave early and come to Hot Doug's for lunch. True story. This was only my second visit to Hot Doug's (since I live about a 2 hour flight away), and this time I had the blue cheese pork sausage with creamy green apple sauce and crushed smoked almonds. You can't call this sort of genius a mere hot dog. This is molecular gastronomy on a bun. I also had the corndog. And and and.. the duck fat fries.. so heart-stoppingly delicious. One order is plenty for 2-3 people, but I recommend that everybody order their own and stuff themselves into a painful, painful delirium. Bonus points for high-larious decor, including a history of sausage, complete with cave paintings. O, happiness, how you have come to us encased in membranes, sweet, sweet membranes..."
1608,"After reading several reviews of Hot Doug's i decided on a recent trip to Chicago to visit a friend that i had to check it out, no matter what the cost or how long i had to wait. We got there around 1pm on a saturday and had to wait about 45 minutes but boy was it worth it. I got the foie gras hot dog with truffle butter and foie gras mousse, and a jalapeno chardonnay rattlesnake dog with smoked gouda and chipotle mayo. Both were out of this world, leave you drooling and staring off into space good. The GF ordered a traditional brat and our friend got a polish sausage. I had bites of both, and while they were certainly more traditional dogs, both were perfectly executed. We also got an order of regular fries and an order of duck fries (served on friday and saturday ONLY) for the sake of comparison. The duck fries are cut thinner, a little crispier, and have a bit of a more complex flavor, but both options are ridiculously tasty. This place is truly and gem and makes me jealous of all you folks that get to live in Chicago (until the winter, when you guys get to envy all of us in the Bay Area). This might just have to be one of those places i hit every time i return to Chicago. Its THAT good."
1609,"Oh "" Keira Knightley"" (formerly the Jennifer Garner and the Britney Spears) the unspeakable things I would love to do to you right now... Hot Doug's is probably the best Hot Dog joint I have ever ate at. I first heard about this place on the Food Network and decided to check it out while I was in Chicago. I read horror stories of 2 hour waits, so I decided to get there by 10:30 am. To my surprise, there was still a 45 minute wait in the cold, winter day of Chicago, but it was worth it. My fianc and I ordered 3 different hot dogs between the 2 of use and shared an order of the duck fat fries with the other couple we were with. I forget what we ordered, but the dogs were delicious. They serve the standard Chicago-style hot dog or for the more adventurous they have exotic hot dogs made of other animals and fancy cheeses. I also like how the owner has a sense of humor of naming his creations after celebrities. This is a definitely a hot spot of newbies in Chicago. Highly recommend! A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures."
1610,"Pretty darn good. Not sure if it was worth the 30 minute wait, but I'm glad I stayed in line. Not sure if I'd do it again, though. It is, after all, just a hot dog. Had the Marty Allen grilled w/ mustard on the side (husband hates mustard) and he had the Keira Knightly. Husband wished he ordered the spicy ribeye sausage since the KK wasn't hot enough. Also calorie-splurged on the duck fat fried fries. Good cheap eats if you're willing to wait. Line does move ""quickly"" though and you are likely to get a table. (Tables turn pretty quickly.) People are super friendly. Good menu; something for everyone. They even have special dogs and weekly game dogs, which I think they were out of since I didn't see it on the board (went on a Saturday)."
1611,"This place is unique. It has unique sausages, and as a chef Doug has taken the encased meat to the next level, which I applaud. What I don't applaud is him doing foie gras and that whole song and dance, especially after the ban, for his little piece of fame, which is why I vow never to go back and stand in line for this goofy sausage stand, which doesn't even have the best Chicago hot dog in the city -- there are a lot better around, where you don't have and wait in line for hours to get it, and it actually tastes better. Now if you simply can't live without your John Graham Mellor or a Salma Hayek, go, away with you, get thee to the line full of conformity and take solace in the fact that you are there because you truly are a sausage fan, and not a poseur. And don't get me started on the duck fat fries. Unique, yes, and interesting to try once, but besides being hand cut, I could find nothing amazing to the palatte about these fried tubers, just a different medium for cooking the starch which requires numerous dead ducks. I might be a bit harsh here, but honestly, if you have anything better to do it isn't worth the pilgrimage and wait through the cult following that Hot Doug's has spawned. Sausage, good. Hot dogs, eh. Fries, just good plain cut fries."
1612,What to say about Hot Doug's that hasn't already been said? I had a brat and duck sausage. It was awesome. That's really about it.
1613,"You gotta love Hot Doug's! The duck fat frites (served only on Fridays and Saturdays) are so fabulous, they're worth a trip in themselves. Be prepared to stand in line for quite some time and then fight for a table, but I promise you, it's worth it. The food is inventive...think reindeer dogs at Christmas time, and other exotic ""encased meats"" like buffalo on a weekly basis. Of course, they have the standards as well. Doug himself takes the orders most of the time and is super bad ass for becoming the first restauranteur to be slapped with a fine for serving foie gras after the ban. Imagine...foie gras at a hot dog stand! Last time we were there, we ended up standing next to the old Tribune food critic and a recognized travel author who ended up sharing a table with us. Everyone comes here because it's the best! A few words of warning: be careful of the strange hours Doug's keeps. I guess when you're the best, you can be open as you please. Also, bring cash."
1614,"I've always heard about this place but I finally FINALLY got the chance to go. This was my first time here and lemme just say. It was WELL worth the wait. Just go with a couple of friends and chat while waiting. It makes it feel like the wait is nothing. And by the time you get to the front, you're hungry and ready to eat! When you get inside... Doug? takes your order and lemme just say. For some guy thats only spending about 1-5 minutes taking your order... he's the friendliest person you'll meet. The hot dogs are about $7-8 and can get pretty crazy. Since this is my first time, I felt like I had to try some crazies. So I went with the crazy thai chicken thing. It had seaweed salad on top of a chicken sausage and spicy mayo. Strangely enough, it takes like a giant sushi roll... but it was good enough to make me want to go again."
1615,"I wish that Hot Doug's had a larger location, because it really is tough to stand outside smelling the grill and watching other people eat for a half-hour. The line on weekends is rough on a hangover, but the greasy food can cure that hangover right up. The combinations of meat, cheeses, and sauces isn't rivaled anywhere else in the city. The rotation of sausages makes it impossible to have a favorite, although I do try and order any cherry-pork sausages I see rotated onto the menu. I can't think of anything new to contribute to the other great reviews. The service is excellent, and this place is a real Chicago staple. The duck fat fries kind of go through your system like White Castle sliders, but the taste is something that needs to be experienced!"
1616,"I booked a last minute business trip to Chicago this week and already knew I was going to try this place before I bought the flight. I tried deep dish pizza and an italian beef sandwich both for the first time, but Hot Doug's was my favorite. I was going to order some fries and a Chicago-style dog for sure, but couldn't decide on what 'Special Dog' to get. I landed on the duck sausage w/ foie gras, but when I asked Doug for a recommendation, he said the portuguese smoked sausage with aged cheese was good, so I went with that. He said he wasn't good at recommendations, which I can understand because everything looked great! He was spot on with the rec though because I loved that hot dog. It had such a unique flavor between the smokiness, cheese, and creme topping that melded the 2 together. Chicago dog was good as well as the hand cut fries. Sadly it was Thursday, so I couldn't try the duck fat fries. I saw a sign that said they would be closed for the next 4 days, so I feel lucky to have stopped in when I did. I will most definately stop by Hot Doug's again if/when I come back to CHI town."
1617,"I had my doubts. What could possibly be so great about a hot dog place!? Well, I ate a goddamn rattlesnake sausage thats what! There's not much else that needs to be said about Hot Dougs. Just try it!"
1618,"So this is how it went down: DOUG: So do you want fries with that? ME: Oh no that's cool--I'm gonna' have some of his. (Points to boyfriend at pop machine) DOUG: Well if he doesn't share let me know caus' I'll drop him like a 6th grader in French class! (end scene) Thanks for looking out for me, Doug! Your cheese fries are immortalized in all their splendor on my best friends face book graffiti wall. BTW all of your food/dogs are kick ass and you also have browns pop, which is totally awesome. Yeah I said pop. If I ever thought about moving away from chicago, your joint would be on the ""reasons to stay"" side of my comparision list...right above ""cheese fries sharing boyfriend"". Thanks again, and I'll be back soon!"
1619,"I heart Hot Doug's and if I could I would marry it. While visiting Chicago, my friend took me here on a Friday to sample the hot dogs and duck fat fries. Although he claims Portillo's is a better hot dog (I disagree), we can both agree that it's clear Doug has a passion for great sausage and really cares about his customers. We ordered: Jalapeno and bacon duck sausage with blood orange mustard - duck sausage was out of this world, although the blue cheese was a bit overpowering Corned beef sausage with chicken liver mousse and horseradish mustard topped with shredded swiss - the chicken liver mousse really made the corned beef hot dog amazing The Dog grilled with everything on it - very tasty version of the classic Chicago style dog Duck fries (only Fri/Sat) - crispy, savory, and perfectly salty. duck fat fries will not taste like duck, but being fried in duck fat seems to make the fries crispy without being soggy or mealy (I really love well fried fries) The wait will be out the door, the line will move (relatively) quickly, and you will not be disappointed. Next time I'll try to catch the infamous Foie gras hot dog!"
1620,"After hearing so many good things and seeing it on the Food Network, I figured it was time I try Hot Doug's. I guess 100 other people had that same thought that Saturday afternoon. We had to wait in line for 1 hour and 45 minutes for these friggin hot dogs! And just our luck it was about 18 degrees that day! We trekked our booties all the way to Avondale just for these hot dogs so we had no choice but to wait in this ridiculously long line. My toes were frozen and I really, really, really do not think I'll ever do something that dumb again. When we finally made it through the double doors, I was so delerious, I didn't even know where to start. There were so many different hot dogs to choose from and the menu had all kinds of celebrity specialites. But ok seriously . . . about the dogs. They do mean serious business when it comes to their encased meats. The hot dogs are creative, gourmet, and delicious. They come in all kinds of different flavors with all different kinds of combinations of spices, cheeses, and various ingredients. If I were to just rate the hot dogs, I would definitely give them a 5. However, my overall experience waiting in the freezing cold- birngs it down a couple notches. Come on I'm a California girl and I do not like standing outside in freezing temps. . .no matter how good the hot dogs really are."
1621,"Choosing the right time to go is important if you want to soak in the atmosphere of this great place. I have gone around 10:45 to 11:15 and have enjoyed a no line wait. In order to compare HD's to other hot dog stands, you need to get the regular chicago dog. However, there is nothing wrong in getting one of the specials. I recently tried the Jack Daniel's dog which had pork and anchovy sauce. The dog was cooked perfectly, a tender meat inside surrounded by a crisp skin. It is covered in smoked swiss cheese, so it was a bit much. I would recommend the cheese fries if you don't mind feeling heavy afterwords. Skip the fountain soda's and get a Dr. Brown's Cream Soda. Remember to tip."
1622,"I had been here once before on a Saturday & waited for over an hour for the delicious dogs. This time I went on a Monday afternoon thinking I could avoid the line...WRONG!!! Still waited about 35mins but hey, the wait is worth it! I had the Teuben: corned beef sausage with Russian dressing, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese) and the Turducken sausage with smokey bacon sauce , venison pate and mustard seed Gouda cheese. The Turducken seemed to be a popular choice. I kept hearing people order it. The sausage alone was tasty, but throw the sauce, cheese AND venison on top of that...OMG...amazing! I did, however, enjoy the Teuben a bit more. I love sauerkraut and I think it went perfect with the dressing & swiss. Get that TEUBEN!!! The cheese fries on the side was ""frosting on the cake!!!"" Doug was working the counter like the last time I was there. The guy is so nice. His employees are friendly as they walk around with smiles, greeting hungry patrons & asking everyone how it was at the end of the meal. They can even read your mind & ask you if you want to pack up what you can't finish before you can ask them. Are you patient? Can you bear the wait? If so, definitely hit up Hot Doug's ASAP!!! P.S. Not sure if it's true, but I heard if you head there around 345ish on weekdays, you won't wait."
1623,"The BEST joint for unique, gourmet hot dogs! Our hotel was in downtown so it was about a 45 minute bus ride (with 1 transfer) to Hot Doug's. Goodness gracious, the line was already wrapped around the building. We ended up waiting 2 1/2 hours until we reached the counter. And lo and behold, it was Doug himself! He was a really nice guy and kinda took his time taking our order - no wonder the line was moving so slow. C'mon Doug, you need to think of a more efficient system so your customers aren't wasting their entire afternoon to grab a few hot dogs. The Uber Garlic Pork Sausage and Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage are to die for - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! I also tried The Atomic Bomb, which was only ok. Everyone raved about the duck fat fries, the reason why we went on a Friday - sorry to disappoint, but it's totally overrated. I mean it's good, but I think I'd rather go on a weekday for shorter lines. For all you tourists, a visit to Hot Doug's is a must, but make sure you arrive at least 30 min. before opening to avoid a long wait."
1624,"It has great atmosphere, great service, good clientele, cleanliness, and tasty dogs and fries with a great selection. I think it is slightly overrated. I don't think it's worth a 30minute wait. I did try the duck fat fries- in my professional french fry opinion, these duck fat fries are not really ""fries"". They're more like potato sticks or even potato crisps. Crispy on the outside, dry and mushy in the inside. But they are delicious! I wonder if their regular fries are more like real (in true Belgian definition) fries."
1625,"The long lines and anticipation of a great meal are worth it. This place has great staples and out of this world specials. While you are there definitely get an order of the duck fat fries, they're really good. On an additional note, Doug and his crew provide excellent customer service. My only gripe is that the place is pretty small and this definitely isn't on the top of my list for ambience. Still, it's eclectic and you may not notice because you'll be enjoying your food too much."
1626,"Thanks Yelp. Another good call. My aunt lives in the Roscoe Village neighborhood and I had to hit this spot being probably the top-reviewed restaurant in the neighborhood. Waited from 1pm-1:45pm in a line going out the door and around the corner but I hear the friday lunch crowd is a little bigger. Time went slowly because of the anxiety, but I quickly forgot the wait after my meal. I ordered the smoked shrimp and pork sausage with remoulade sauce and gouda cheese. It was easily the best sausage-on-a-bun experience I've ever had. My only regret is that I got the duck-fat fries. They're no huge thrill really, they seem like ordinary fries to me. Next time I'd probably order two sausages (I was also hoping to try the duck in truffle butter sausage) or share that second one with whoever I'm dining with. Man was that good. I'll overlook the fries issue because the menu is ala carte and they're optional anyway, and the sausage was just too good for this place to get under a full five stars."
1627,"Doug's takes the dog to a new level. Thank God I'm back to eating meat again! I had the Ribeye dog with Chimichurri sauce. Dude. How can you not love a STEAK HOT DOG??? The only thing that would have made it better would be to wrap it in bacon (are you listening, Doug????). The line is hellishly long, but moves quickly and there is somehow always a place to sit (since people scarf down those encased meats like candy). Free refills on drinks -- my new favorite is 1/2 7-Up, 1/4 Cherry Coke, 1/4 Fanta Orange. It kicks ass. Seriously. Doug could not be nicer if he tried. Adorable and bespectacled and willing to explain any of the meats on the menu if you're uncertain about their ingredients. My ribeye dog was incredible. The chimichurri sauce is basically like a parsley pesto. Excellent, but extremely garlicky. Bring breath mints. While I hear the standards (named after famous celebs and members of Doug's familia) are excellent, I would recommend the Special encased meats...gourmet concoctions with interesting relishes (i.e. cranberry-pear relish or goat cheese or the aforementioned chimichurri). I'm craving a ribeye dog right now, honestly. Mmmm....encased meat...."
1628,You ruined our Chicago trip by not being open on Sundays and closing at 4pm. Your hours suck.
1629,"Hot Doug's is hands down, the BEST hot dog that money can buy! There's something about that neon green relish, pickle spear, mustard, and poppy seed bun, that make this perfectly cooked dog, well, perfect! Even my sister who doesn't like red meat (or dogs of any kind,) really enjoyed her dog! If you've never tried one, then you need to get an original Hot Doug hot dog, but if you're feeling adventurous, Hot Doug's is also known for having a revolving inventory of unique meets in tube form, such as the Cherry Pork sausage, Wild Boar, Foi Gras, Cricket, Elk, Blue Cheese, etc. Their fries are pretty bomb, as well. Just don't ask for Ketchup, it's frowned upon in this establishment! You should expect to wait in line, as this is a very popular joint, as well as a very small one as well. The line does move fairly quickly however, and you will be greeted by Doug himself at the cash register. *note - this establishment is CASH ONLY.* Doug is awesome. Even with the large volume of customers that he sees in a day, he remembered me when I came back again later in the day. Whenever I'm in Chicago, I HAVE to make my way to Doug's!"
1630,"Yeah, everyone already read the 30,000 reviews on OMG ITS A HOT DOG WITH A BUFFALO IN IT. Well, yeah that's great but I am not really impressed. I heard gossip about this place when I lived in Boston 5 years ago, so I eventually went, and waited and waited and eventually got to eat some stupid 9 dollar hot dog. Now, I don't want to be a stick in the mud, nor a sheep in the field so I'm going with 2. If this place had you in and out in 20 minutes, I'd give it 5 damn stars. But, it's a god damn hot dog. A HOT DOG. It'd probably be quicker to fly to NYC and get one off a street vendor that would have just as many mystery meats in it. NahI'msayin? I had some kind of thing with Havartia cheese and some other stuff on it. It was good, but uh, whatever. So is pasta and sauce and I""m not going to wait in line for 2 hours for this. Oh yeah, and the hours are fukken bogus. ALSO Someone started a downtown delivery service of Hot Doug's and it got shut down within a week or two by the owner. MAYBE if your place was EVER open.... oh wait, suckers everywhere love to feel like waiting somehow gets you better food. peace."
1631,"Finally made it out here on a Saturday morning 25 mins to open. There was already a line of 20-30 people, but 5 minutes later the same number of people had lined up behind us. Street parking was ample, though I imagine it got worse for the people 20 behind us. At 10:30 sharp, the doors opened and the line slowly started moving. Got to the front of the line at 11:00 and ordered: 1. The Game of the Week: Brown Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese 2. The Smoky Joe Wood (Today's Celebrity Sausage): Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mustard and Sesame-Seaweed Salad 3. Garlic-Rosemary Smoked Chicken Sausage with Rosemary-Garlic Mustard and Smoked Cumin Gouda Cheese 4. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris Managed to snag a seat indoors and the food came quickly (less than 5 mins). Thoughts: 1. Good though the cheddar wasn't melted and didn't pack any horseradish taste. 2. Delightfully spicy. Who knew seaweed salad would go well on a hot dog? 3. Mustard was a bit overpowering. Couldn't really taste the dog or the garlic. There must be another garlic dog that other yelpers refer to. 4. AMAZING. I would eat nothing but this for a week if Hot Doug's was open that many days of the week. The sausage itself was already tastier than the other sauges and then the foie gras was just the amazing delicious cherry on top. Do yourself a favor and order one. Gets 5 stars based on this alone. On the way out, the line was even longer than the longest it had been earlier, so looks like there's no avoiding the wait on Saturdays."
1632,"I'm not the first to write a review on Hot Dougs and I definitely will not be the last but this place makes a mean dog. I went with a friend to check it out and he thought it would be a good idea to share food. I am not normally into sharing even with my girlfriend but I am glad we decided to share. We got the duck fat french fries along with four hot dogs. My favorite dog we tried was the buffalo dog. The meat was fantastic and every bite was delicious. Next, we moved to the Foie Gras dog. I enjoyed it but would actually prefer it for desert. The next two dogs were not worth discussing becasue the first two were so spectacular. The bottom line is that Hot Dougs changed the way I look at hot dogs. This man Doug is truly a meat visionary. It is worth the wait."
1633,"Everything I have to say has been said by the 1073 previous reviews. Just want to say kudos to Doug for giving a sincere ""Hello how are you?"" to every single customer. Since there is always a line, he is always busy but he takes the time to say hi and gives individual attention to everyone. One more thing- yum."
1634,"The only possible reason for marking Hot Doug's down is that now every other sausage, hot dog, or french fry that I eat tastes just a little bit worse in comparison. Hot Doug is doing god's work and there's no two ways about it. The wait can be close to two hours, bring a friend, a book, a phone, a video game this is the 21st century, if you can't entertain yourself for that long then you need to up your ritalin dosage. Duck fat frites prove the existence of a loving force for good in the universe. The foie gras duck sausage is transcendent, but so is everything else. If you even care the slightest about sausage, then you must eat here before you die; it's a revelatory experience about the glory of meat in tube form."
1635,Simply the best. Worth the wait.. Doug is the man and runs a tight ship and caters to you the customer. Keria Knightly fire dog is awesome added some sport peppers for even more heat. Wife had a veggie dog and liked it. Fries with cheese sauce are worth the inevitable heart attack! I vow to go there on every trip I make to Chicago! CASH ONLY
1636,"It's rare that I give a place a 5-star rating. It's even rarer that I'll wait in line for an hour and a half for a darn hot dog and fries. Lucky for me, it wasn't freezing outside that November morning and I got what I was waiting for...encased meat at its finest. Owner Doug Sohn is funny as he is genius. How can you possibly serve all of those people waiting outside when the dining room can barely seat 30? Timing, it's all about timing and Doug is the Man when it comes to hauling loads of people into his shop. What to order: Duck Fries and a Foie Gras Dog. Period. Hot Doug's has made encased meats a necessity. Doug, we salute you!"
1637,"I went to Chicago on a mini-food tour back in May. After seeing this place featured on the Travel Channel's Hot Dog Paradise, I had to make a stop. Went here with a couple friends and waited 2 hours in line on Friday morning of the Memorial Day weekend. Wow. Once we got in, Doug took our order and when one of the bussers saw that we were a group of 3, he cleared and saved a table for us. How nice! I went with one of the specials - bacon sausage with creme fraiche caramelized onions and triple cream Brie cheese - and the dog with everything. We also shared an order of duck fat fries, which were yummy but not more special than any other kind of fries. Except that we waited 2 hours for them. Everything was delicious, although the bacon sausage dog I had was pretty rich....in a good way. The next time I come to Chicago, the long wait in line would make me think twice about taking another trip to Hot Doug's. I would try more of the specialty dogs and come wayyyy earlier."
1638,"It's hard for me to write this review, because just thinking about my trip to Hot Doug's makes me hungry! Oh, I'm sorry, are you still there? I just spent 5 minutes dreaming of the Cheddar and Jalapeo Duck Sausage with Smoked Gouda and the duck fat fries. My friends loved their Chicago-style Polish sausage and Ribeye sausage with Brie. None of us could stop eating the duck fries, even once we were full. This place is worth the hype. And the wait. Though, honestly, if I'd had to wait much longer, I might have been too hungry to really enjoy it. I think that's probably why the ice cream man parked his truck right by the line!"
1639,It is the equivalent to Artichoke's Pizza in NYC: Great gourmet version of a fast-food with a long line. The dogs are great... but that line is obnoxious. I love the duck fried fries... but that line!!! The service would be good... except that line!!!!!!!!!! Artichoke's and Hot Dougs both would be better if they opened more locations.
1640,"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE, I SUGGEST NEVER GOING THERE!!!! (I was just doing my part to shorten the line) I will always wait for you Hot Dougs, one of your sausages in my mouth makes me feel complete. I think this relationship is getting serious. I just wish I could have your sausages late into the night! Yours truly, until next week...."
1641,"I tend to avoid establishment reviewed as ""if you don't like it here, I hate u!! lmao!! zzz"" But, said reviewer might be on to something here, because Hot Doug's is delicious. Just come on a weekday to avoid the line. I waited about ten minutes on a Tuesday afternoon. Why would you ever go to Alinea when you can get interesting, delicious flavor combinations at eight bucks a pop?"
1642,"I cannot give a well-rounded review of Hot Doug's because I only tried one hot dog, the Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage w/ Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. http://bit.ly/doFHN9 After hearing and reading so much about this infamous dog, not gonna lie I had high expectations of it. But to be brutally honest, the dog deserves 2 stars because indeed, it is ""meh"" and ""I've (definitely) experienced better."" --the sausage itself was okay/mediocre/nothing special --hated ""havin to pick the skin of the sausage out of my mouth"" http://bit.ly/dyVvNZ every couple of bites --the truffle aioli condiment was perhaps the tastiest thing about this hot dog --the foie gras mousse was ""velvety & feta cheese-y in texture... yet a tad funky, taste-wise"" http://bit.ly/dyVvNZ --the sprinkle of fleur de sel on top does nothing to complement the already very complex flavours in the dog --since all the ingredients in this dog are quite soft, another reason I didn't enjoy it very much is that it lacked contrast in textures (i.e. crunchiness with tenderness, etc.) --eating this hot dog felt like eating pure mushiness Overall, I'm glad I went the adventurous route (as per usual) by trying the Foie Gras dog. Certainly can't wait to try many of the other hot dogs at Hot Doug's... like the Keira Knightley or the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage."
1643,"Yes, the line can get out of control. Yes, it's cash only. Yes, the hours are limited. Yes, it's gotten tons of, maybe too much exposure. But you knew all that going in. All that really matters is the food. And Doug Sohn delivers. Whether it's one of the pricey but superb specialty sausages, one of the more standard numbers, or just a dog with everything, with peppers, Doug Sohn delivers. If you don't like the food at Hot Doug's, then I hate you."
1644,"Everything you have heard is true. Go!....after checking their website to see if they are open, of course. 3 out of the 4 times I made the trek out there (twice with out-of-town guests), HD was closed. Personally, I love that he gives his employees so much time off, so consider this a friendly service announcement and not a complaint per se. Hot Doug's is best experienced with a group of friends as there are way too many interesting dogs to try. I would say 2-3 per person is enough and that a serving of the justly famous duck fat fries will keep 4 people happy. Besides the Foie Gras dog (which is an absolute must), my only other advice is to steer clear of the hotter dogs: they pack some serious heat and may detract from the other items waiting patiently to be devoured."
1645,"Wow! So good! Really great food, cheap prices, overall great experience. I had the chicken sausage SW style and it was amazing. If you haven't been, please-- just go. :)"
1646,"For my boyfriend's birthday we decided to come to Chicago on a hot dog pilgrimage. Of course, Hot Doug's was the feature stop. We got there at about 10:00 AM on Saturday, the line wasn't too long. But we waited, and it was cold. We inched closer and closer, and before we knew it, we were in. Boy ordered the Duck & Foie Gras, plus a Chicago Dog, and I ordered the Black & Blue. I really didn't like mine at all. His on the other hand was fantastic. The duck fat fries were inexplicably delicious and addictive. Overall, it was a fun experience, but I think the hype is a little out of control. My local hot dog favorite back in Minneapolis has dogs that are just as good, if not better, without the inflated prices and long line. But those fries...now those I could go back for."
1647,"By definition ... as good as it gets. Worth driving out of your way for ... $6-12 sausages (encased meats) ... unique and flavorful ... PERFECT Plus, Doug is a cool dude."
1648,"This place has traditionally tracked as one of the greatest hot dog places in Chicago and the world. Enough people have written reviews but I'm going to throw my two cents in and please don't be offended: If you want a delicious meal be ready to spend a little bit more money. If you can't afford $10 (hahahaha) to $20.00 on an awesome meal and experience don't waste your time coming here. Don't wast your time in line. Just don't go. If you are in a big hurry to get somewhere or do something don't come here. They sell a $2.00 hot dog when I was last here two weeks ago. Don't stand in line for a $2.00 hot dog (and then complain that its just a hot dog)!!!! Its just a goddamn hot dog, what did you expect? If you want hot dogs go to Gene N Judes or parky's or buona or something. This place is not for regular wieners. If you're going to stand in line and its just you order a couple of things you've never tried before off their specials: Duck Foie Gras (I always get one), rattlesnake, crayfish, rabbit, elk etc. If you're with people who can spend money ($10-$20) or are worth spending money on ($10-$20 per person) : share several different items off their specials. Theyre totally delicious. If you're here on Friday or Saturday then get the duck fat fries. They're delicious. Don't waste time. Don't waste money. Do it right."
1649,"You've seen it on the Travel Channel. You've read about it in the Redeye and the Chicago Reader. You've heard about it from co-workers, but you still haven't gone. Why not? Hot Doug's is a quality place to get some good eats. Sure you have to wait in line, but trust me it really isn't all THAT bad, it moves quickly and you make friends with the people who are just as eager as you to try the duck fat fries and foie gras topped sausages. If you go during the week, the duck fat fries aren't an option, but the wait is considerably less. If you do end up venturing to this mecca of meaty goodness, take caution and check the website before you leave. Hot Doug's is owned by, you guessed it, Doug and he does take vacations from time (who can blame him? he works all week, every week) and so the shop can be closed certain holidays. Also, it is CASH ONLY so be sure to hit up an ATM. This isn't your average hot dog joint and they specialize in exotic sausages, not hot dogs. So if you are looking for you classic Chicago style dog, your best bet is your local hot dog stand (Hot Doug's certainly sells Chi style dogs, but they are made with caramelized onions, which in my opinion makes them too soggy). The only reason I give Hot Doug's four stars instead of five is that it isn't the most accessible place to get to, but its worth the trek. So take your taste buds on an epic journey and try the game of the week (especially if its the mountain man sausage) with some duck fat fries. Its worth standing in line for an hour and your mouth will be glad you did (even if you cholesterol levels aren't)."
1650,Doug. Is. Goud. er...God. Doug is god.
1651,"I don't know what else to add to all the great things that have been said about Hot Dougs. So Instead I'll list some of my favorite encased meats that Doug offers. -Pork and blue Cheese sausage. The cheese and sauce differ from time to time but I make sure that the sausage includes smoked almonds. The almonds are the key. If they aren't included, I look at the alternatives offered. -Atomic Ribeye sausage. This is my favorite of the bunch. I don't see it that often but when it's on the menu, I get in my car and go go gooooo! Beefy and spicy! Well worth the $8 sticker price! -Boar sausages. The kind of sausage sometimes differs but the boar taste comes through. It's meaty but diiferent than the beef sausages. Excellent! If you are just looking for a chicago-style hot dog, go someplace else. Not that Hot Dougs doesn't do a great version, because it does but you can get chicago dog without having to wait over an hour anyplace else. I haven't been back in a couple months because I just can't wait in line the reported 2 hours+ that people seems to be writing about. I'm glad that Doug is getting the praise because it is well deserved. I just wish it didn't interfere with my encased meat consumption."
1652,"Visiting Hot Doug's provided the best culinary experience I had during my recent trip to Chicago. I was standing in (an arguably short by some NYC standards) line with hungry anticipation and saw the ""cash only"" sign. I dug through my pockets to see what I had: 15 dollars to feed both myself and a friend. ""Not a problem,"" I thought. Technically it wasn't: I got up to the counter and order a grilled Portuguese Linguica accompanied with a saffron rouille and 12-yearManchego cheese. My friend ordered a The Dog and a small fountain soda. We had some money left so I asked the gentleman behind the counter (Doug?) for a recommendation. ""The Thuringer,"" he said. Heaven. The linguica in particular was one of the best things I have ever eaten...and my round belly can attest to many things consumed. My only regret was that we didn't have any more money to try anything else on the menu and that it wasn't Friday or Saturday so I could get fries cooked in duck fat. Writing this I can't help but think, ""Can they ship one to me right now?"""
1653,"My first Yelp review. I felt the need to review Hot Doug's as my first review. What more can I say about this place?? I've been coming here since I was in the tiny high school just up California ave. (06!!) For years now I have enjoyed duck fat fries on Fridays along with the classic Chicago Dog. (NO KETCHUP EVER!!!) Also, buffalo sausage, ostrich sausage, thuringer, The Teuben (my favorite specialty, tastes like I'm at Manny's!) and a b.l.t. sausage believe it or not! (bacon as a sausage?? Believe it!) This is simply my favorite place for a red hot. I've been to MANY shacks and stands and while many are very tasty, Hot Doug's will always be on my standard."
1654,"I ordered the foie gras duck sausage per fellow yelper's recommendations and it was delicious, of course. But my foie gras came out all crumbly instead of being in the nice thick slices I see from other Yelper's pictures. I felt kind of cheated for what I had to pay for that duck sausage hence the loss of stars. However, I don't think that instance alone will hinder me from trying Hot Doug's again. I am sure it has a 4.5 star average with 1200+ reviews for good reason. Hopefully I will leave a happier camper the next time around."
1655,Believe the hype. More than a meal. An experience every single time.
1656,"Its Chicago's hot dog cult hit, that you should experience at least once if you haven't been yet. Be aware that this is an event, as much as it is a restaurant, so the line is similar to a roller coaster park. Try to make it on Fri or Sat for the duck fat fries. They're worth it. Also, skies the limit on potential dog offerings. Too many to describe, so just go and discover."
1657,"Where else can you get spicy peanut sauce on a hot dog? For those who like to plan ahead, Doug updates the site daily: http://www.hotdougs.com"
1658,"I am a hot dog connoisseur, and hot dougs is a holy grail of encased meats. I got a standard chicago dog ($1.75) and an ostrich dog with venison pate ($8). Both were frigging awesome!"
1659,5 stars 'nuff said. FRIES Turkey/Chicken/Veggie options! The owner is awesome and I trust anything Anthony Bourdain loves.
1660,"I waited two hours in line for the hot dogs and fries here. And you know what? I'd easily have waited two more. This was, bar none, the best tubed meat I've ever eaten. I went here thinking this was just a place for a good Chicago-style hot dog. No no! It's so much more. To give you and idea: after whipping out my iPhone to see the menu (yes, it's online complete with the daily specials), I had to make the hardest decision of my life. Alligator sausage or hot dog with foie gras? I chose the latter. It was probably the richest, most extravagant hot dog I'd ever eaten. Sausage with foie gras on it with truffle aoili on it. Dear gods, it was amazing. And the fries! The FRIES! Duck fat french fries. This, my dear Benjamin Franklin, is proof that god loves us. Right there. And how much did all this artery clogging goodness cost? Not even $15 for 2 dogs (the fancy and a non-fancy one), splitting the fries, and a drink. Have I found heaven? I think I may have. I will be going to this place every time I go to Chicago. It's worth it."
1661,"Bring some patience and bug spray as the line is usually long and there are biting bugs that like to wait with you in the summer. Cash only, and check ahead because the hours are short and they like to take weeks off around the holidays. Aside from all that, the people we waited with were friendly, as was Doug. The decor was hot dog 50's kitsch and clean. We ordered several specials so we could sample and share. There was a raspberry smelly cheese number, jalapeno, a regular dog, and some duck fat fries of course! Pretty delicious homemade encased meats and a good time."
1662,"Wow, what diversity in a hot dog place!!! A little over the edge for my standards and I eat just about anything. This place is always packed, and there's a good reason for it. Get there early before noon or after 1:30 unless you enjoy waiting in line for about a half hour. Well worth the wait though if your in the mood for a hot dog, polish, or brat with a twist of whatever Doug's got on his ever changing menu. Thank God (and Doug) for encased meat!!"
1663,"Waiting builds character. You will build a lot of character here. When you are done building said character, you are in for a full-on kicking screaming sausage assault of the second-best kind (let's be realistic here). I had the rosemary chicken sausage with garlic-rosemary mustard and camembert cheese. At that point I had gotten mildly freaked out from being in an enclosed space with a lot of people, so I was a little upset/frazzled and just wanted to sit down and have my food without being stared at by people in line as I ate (I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT STOP PLEASE JUST LOOK AT THE MENU BLANKLY), but I'm not letting my own psychotic hangups get in the way of expressing how good that mother effing sausage was. My partner in meat crime got the Alsacienne (bacon sausage with creme fraiche and triple creme brie, pile some more dairy on this death machine please), and I almost bit the tips of my fingers off in excitement when nom nom nomming on his culinary choice (I am doing my best to avoid further 4th grade innuendos and it's not that easy, throw me a bone...er cut me some slack?). He loved his meat choice and was thoroughly satisfied. Brilliant marketing with the ""cash-only-open-till-4"" thing. You can afford to do shit like this when you've got amazing food to back it up. Smart, smart, smart. I will be back."
1664,"These hot dogs owned me. The specialty dogs are so rich and full of flavor I almost couldn't handle it. I ate two bites, and had to take a break. Even the regular dogs are yum. -1 for the long wait (2 hours on a Saturday). +1 for Doug manning the counter (awww you care!) Dang. I just had it yesterday, but I'm already craving it again..."
1665,"The first thing that struck me about Hot Doug's is that it is an incredible business model. Have your clientele wait in anticipation, poring over your menu, for hours before they get to the counter, and I guarantee they'll order 4 times what they'd intended. This was the first stop on my summer project with my fiance, the Great Summer Sandwich Adventure. Hot dogs and hamburgers, we have arbitrarily decided, count as sandwiches, but burritos don't. We feel like we've already discovered many excellent taquerias, and do not require structure to further this quest. Hot Doug's has always abstractly been on our list of Things To Do Before Leaving Chicago, but we ended up actually going because we had family in town who were interested. On a rainy Saturday morning, the line was an hour and a half to two hours long. By the time we got to the front, we were veterans. The people behind us, hoping for a tasty, greasy hangover cure, found the wait too uncomfortable, and the guys in front of us just plain got bored. We ended up ordering the fois gras dog (of course), the smoked crayfish and pork and the classic Chicago dog, supplemented by an order of duck fat fries. Everything was completely delicious. Honestly, you should absolutely get the Chicago dog, even if it looks boring, because it's a sublime combination of flavors and textures. You should also order two orders of fries - the regular and the duck fat - just to contrast flavors. In the end, I probably won't go back to Hot Doug's unless someone else really wants to - it's a little out of the way, and a pretty major time commitment even on weekdays - but I'm hugely glad we went, and that we did it right. This is a Great Summer Sandwich Adventure victory - legendary, inexpensive meat wedged between pieces of bread."
1666,"I'm not waiting in line for a HOT DOG. That's just ridiculous!! Oh...sorry, but who made you Jesus? The fact is you CAN wait in line for a stinkin' hot dog like all the other common folk who are just as hungry as you. Boo hoo, you have to stand, converse with your friend(s), listen to your iPod for a mere 20 minutes at the most...poor you! Once you stop whining and realize that these cheap eats are completely worth it, you'll thank me. The Chicago Hot Dog is a staple to this city and if you're going to eat one, this is where you need to go. Plus, the service is great! This is just one of those mandatory experiences that you need to stick in your back pocket, regardless if you are a local or not. Sidenote: definitely get the fries."
1667,"They are definitely an A+ on creativity and their execution is really good ( although the famed foie gras dog was not that great) However, there are hardly any instances where I can think of, that the wait would be worth it. There is no dog worth an hour wait. Plus the duck fat fries are just really good. Frying them in duck fat does make them THAT much better."
1668,"After about 50 minutes on public transit and another 50 minutes waiting in line, we were finally standing in front of Doug, himself, ordering: - 2 ""Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel"" - 1 ""Red Wine and Demi-Glace Venison Sausage with Fig Goat's Butter and Raclette Cheese"" - 1 ""Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Tomme de Savoie Cheese"" - order of DUCK FAT FRIES One word: AMAZING."
1669,"The foie gras dog changed my life. I could think of many ways I'd rather spend a Saturday morning in December other than standing in a 2-hour line outside.... Writing a thesis perhaps? Or maybe sitting in front of a small child on an airplane? But, let me tell you, that wait for those morsels of encased meaty goodness were worth every blistering cold moment. Doug is a trip, and even after dealing with hoards of people for hours, was still really funny and patient as we tried to ramble off the 9 dogs we had chosen. The only thing that didn't fulfill my needs completely were the duckfat fries. I was expecting something that would dazzle my tastebuds, but they were just fries. Good ones, but nothing spectacular. So if you're looking for a foodgasm, Hot Dougs will make you come again and again."
1670,"Everyone knows Hot Doug's is the greatest thing in the world. Pretty much ever. So it's not like I can really expand on the love here. But I will add to it. Hot Doug's: SAUSAGE CHAMPION! EATING THERE MAKES YOU HANDSOME. AND FRAGRANT. Also, I love me some Doug Sohn. What a swell dude. Yes, I will wait an hour just to see his smiling face. And hot hot sausage."
1671,"Ah, awesome. Heaven on a bun. I'll be back for more, you can bet your buns I will."
1672,"This place is spectacular. Don't be intimidated by the long line or the moronic one-star ratings complaining about the wait -- it's worth it! This place is best experienced by those who have adventurous palates. If you want a boring, traditional hot-dog-and-fries combo, go somewhere else. The many people in line will thank you for cutting down their wait for truly unique food. On my second visit, I had a bacon and cheddar elk sausage with bacon-garlic mayonnaise and black mountain garlic white wine cheese. The only reason I know that is because I took a picture of the menu selection with my iPhone. I tried to get the sausage fried. Doug stopped me and said, ""No. You can get it fried if you really want, but that sausage is best if it's grilled."" Doug knows more than me. The line out the door says so. I took Doug's advice. I made the mistake of ordering ONLY the elk sausage and some great, well-seasoned fries. It leads me to my second piece of advice: order something simple along with your gourmet plate! I say this because you'll want to scarf down food that should truly be enjoyed deliberately. I was starving when my girlfriend and I arrived. After ordering and taking a bite of the elk sausage, I'd wished I'd ordered a hot dog to go along with it. That way, you can scarf down the hot dog before or while enjoying the main event on the tray in front of you. I loved the elk sausage, but I had to exercise restraint from scarfing it down because I was so hungry! Visit Hot Doug's and behold its awesome culinary nature. BEHOLD IT. DO IT."
1673,"OH SNAP! Damn these dogs are good. Gourmet encased meats really hits the nail on the head. If you are looking for something ridiculously exotic between your buns I'd go with the ""Brown Ale Buffalo Sausage with Three Floyd's Alpha King Mustard and Horseradish-Cheddar Cheese"" or you could always try a rattlesnake sausage creation. We asked Doug how he came up with these ideas, ""Doug were you high when you invented your flavors?"" he said no, because if he was everything would just be covered in cheese and funyuns, lot's of funyuns. Eat at Hot Doug's, but be prepared to wait a bit on the weekend. Well worth it though. Say hi to Doug when you see him."
1674,"I visited Chicago for the first time and this place was a requirement for me to check out. The first thing I did when I woke up in the morning was hop on the L and head straight to Hot Doug's. I arrived 30min before opening and there were at least 30 people in front of me already. The wait didn't seem long since I was playing ""Angry Birds"" on my phone. Got to the line and I ordered the foie gras dog, Chicago-style dog, the ""Salma Hayek"" (A spicy andouille sausage) with grilled onions, and the duck fat fries. First off the chicago-style. I got it fully loaded and was good. Everything I asked for. Second, the Salma Hayek. I eyed that thing like it was her and I was a horny adolescent ready to bust for the first time. It was good. Third, the duck fat fries. nom nom nom nom nom. And last the coveted foie gras dog. Words can't describe the sensation that I felt when I bit into that combination of chewy bun, succulent duck sausage, three fat pieces of creamy velvet called foie gras, and some creamy sauce that had a slight bite to it. My heart rate jumped a few beats, my pupils dilated and glazed over, and the perspiration started to dot all over my nose and drip down my forehead. Hallelujer!! I ate all of that and didn't eat till dinner. Luckily the hostel was pretty empty when my bowels ruptured. They were saved. I can't forget Doug. This man is paragon. He made my trip from great to unforgettable. It's people like these and the little things they do for you that make you believe there is a God. Thank you for your wonderful establishment, your generosity and kindness, and giving me the opportunity to taste Salma Hayek. Thanks Doug."
1675,If you're looking for good ole' smoked and grilled hot dogs this is your place.
1676,I actually came here in a winter day..but ofcourse came early...and waited a bit in line...Doug took our order just like on TV...lol...haha I must admit I was somewhat excited lol...the hotdogs where good...but I was expecting more...I tasted the duck fat fries and I didn't like them that much..I love fries and I know their greasy but these fries I could actually taste alllll the grease...I will come again just for the thrill of standinbg in line for a hotdog lol...I know sounds silly...but I just love hotdogs!
1677,"I was told by my friend that we were going here, and I really had little choice as I was staying with him. I was not prepared for the line. Or at least a line that moved so slowly, when it was cold. I truly blame my friend as he didn't tell me this otherwise I would have brought my jacket. 1 hour and 40 minutes after getting on the line, the hot dogs arrive with the duck fat fries. I had a steamed regular dog with everything, which made for quite a busy hot dog. I also had the Celebrity, which was a steak dog with cheese and fried onions. That was phenomenal. The duck fat fries were good. I didn't really get that they were the best fries I'd ever had, but they were tasty. So I enjoyed this place. The line was really long, which means if I lived here I'd probably come here not as often as I'd like. But Doug was so nice. Far more nice than I would be if I had to see hundreds of people. Good stuff. Glad I went. Wish I brought my jacket."
1678,What an amazing collection of jaw dropping hot dogs. I have never tasted anything like them. The foie gras dog is out of this world good. Duck fat fries? Incredible. Every dog was completely over the top. What a brilliant place. Doug was super cool too! You must visit and I must go back - soon
1679,"All (hot) dogs go to heaven because these are simply well...divine! The line is always out the door but it's cool because your iPhone will keep you busy. Doug actually has worked there every time I have been and he's a pretty interesting character. Try the foie gras dog and while you are at it, get the duck fat fries (drooling over the memory of that absolutely sinful treat) but they are only available on Friday and Saturday. There is absolutely nothing like a Chicago hot dog and these are the best. The skin breaks as you bite in making that gentle snapping sound that warns you of the meaty, juicy, warm flavors about to assault your taste buds. You will need to take a moment after your first bite and just be in the moment - you literally won't be able to talk because you are so overwhelmed and happy. When I come back to Chicago, it's definitely a place that I make every effort to eat at and die of happiness for a little while."
1680,"Came on a Saturday thinking to grab lunch. Lunch ended up as early dinner as the line took 2.5 hrs!! By the time we got to the counter, I was starving and wanted to order everything on the menu to make sure I didn't miss out. I couldn't even finish 2 dogs. I love duck. Foie gras over duck sausage is amazing $9. Might be the most expensive encased meat out there. Other specialty encased meat is around $7.50 a pop and regular hot dogs are around 2.75. Alligator one was superb. Atomic bomb was pretty high up there on my list. Nice kick that wont burn ur mouth. Remember to get the duck fat fries offered Fridays and Saturdays!"
1681,"When you hit Bourdain's top 10 places to eat before you die, your doing something right. Hot Doug gives me a culinary erection! I apologize for the disturbing relation, but its true. Long wait, but all god things come to those that do wait. Canfield's 50/50 soda, need I say more? Genius combinations to make up his menu, you truly cant go wrong. Do yourself a favor, dont doubt and get your ass into Hot Doug's."
1682,"Foie gras duck sausage hot dog??? Yes please! We came on a Monday afternoon and there was a line peeking out the door. I guess it's true, there's always a line. While we were in line, the people in front of us started talking and we got involved in a conversation with them, and our 30 minute wait went by a lot quicker. The outside is kind of boring looking, very unassuming, but the inside is kitschy and bright and fun. Lots of primary colors. Lots of hot dog options, and I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of them. We ordered: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel: Woah. So tasty, so decadent, so fatty, so bad for my arteries, but SO GOOD. The sausage itself reminded me of the Taiwanese style pork sausages (for those familiar with longanisa, the Filipino sausage, it's kind of similar). Slightly sweet, very rich. A must try. Crayfish and pork sausage with shrimp remoulade and creme fraiche: Yummy but the creme fraiche had a very goat cheese-y taste to it. We had another 2 hot dogs that were a Jack Daniels fennel pork sausage with something and then the other one had something with smoked gouda. I can't quite recall and the website and menu seems to change daily, but I remember them being very tasty as well. They were a little pricey but you are getting gourmet hot dogs. We had to take the train to the California stop and then hail a tax because it would've been a 1.5 mile walk to Hot Doug's, so just as an FYI, it's not super easy to get to without a car or taxi."
1683,"I absolutely love this place! It is well worth the wait it takes to get in. Doug is incredibly inventive with such a normally mundane food. I had the foi gras dog and the duck fat french fries. The foi gras dog is incredibly rich, but also very flavorful. I couldn't really tell the difference with the duck fat french fries, but they were very good fries."
1684,"Who doesn't love encased meat dressed with minimal veggies, slathered in condiments, and wrapped in a warm bun? Hot Doug's, you always hit the spot. Skip the weekend lines, my friends, and try to come during the week! Best time to come is usually before the lunch rush. Key to success: come before 11 and you will find minimal lines! So skip school or play hookie from work. Hot Doug's is definitely worth it! I enjoy the Marty Allen and so should you!"
1685,"You've heard of it. You've read about it. Now go eat it! I won't bother trying to talk it up any more. It's worth the wait in line. The foie gras hot dog is pretty good and the duck fat fries are even better. They change the menu around, so recommendations are kind of hard, but you won't be disappointed. Don't forget, CASH ONLY!"
1686,"Be ready for a little bit of wait, usually a line out the door around the corner. very nice and helpful staff regardless of the line behind you, which was a big plus for me. Also, this is the place to try the different types of links you wont find elsewhere. Awesome place overall."
1687,"If you're looking for a great place to take visitors, this is it. If you're looking for a unique and gourmet sausage emporium, this is it. If you love hot dogs and hot dog memorabilia, this is it. Don't let the line scare you. It doesn't really take too long to get through. I always order two and usually feel a little sick after from stuffing myself, but I think my family and my boyfriend would eat here every day if they could. Definitely a different and fun slice of Chicago that everyone should experience at least once. Also, Doug is a super nice guy and the rest of the service is always fast, courteous and great! Um, also, the tater tots are the best I've ever had, so get those along with your duck fat fries."
1688,"My Lordy, I still DREAM about Hot Doug's and wish I could transport myself there every day! Went to visit a friend in Chicago and knew I must go to Hot Doug's and only Hot Doug's for a Chicago dog. I'm an avid fan of Anthony Bourdain so I knew the situation upon arrival. When I told my friend I had to eat there she said ""OMG that's the best dog in the city! How did YOU know about it?"" Thank you, Mr Bourdain. Anyway, we waited in line for 2 hours on a Saturday like suckas but boy was it worth it! The inside of the place is amusing and entertaining [some wonderful quote about encased meats...] and it's fun chatting with the people in line and in the restaurant. Everyone is just, excited, to be there and you can feel it! My dogs (that's right, I got 2! I worked up an appetite in line!) were s.u.p.e.r.b. Think I just got the original but they had all kinds of cool variations to choose from. We also were crazy enough to go on a Saturday for the fois gras (duck fat) fries...pretty dang good as well, but I preferred the regular fries. I will be back any and every time I'm in Chicago.....natives of Chicago, I envy you, indeed."
1689,"If you go there, it is of course for having a hot dog. But a very special hot Dog ! This place is a place to go especially on Friday. Fries are cooked in duck fat ! Amazingly good (Do not eat on a regular basis :-) ) Even if you are not a Hot dog person, i recommend to go at least once. The owner is a really nice guy. Cash only"
1690,"You know, when things are so hyped and something has such a reputation I feel like expectations are never met in reality. However, this is one of those times when the hype was true, the expectations were met and the wait well worth it. For some odd reason it's taken me 2 years to come here from when I first heard about Hot Doug's. I had to come on a Friday or Saturday to get the duck fat fries and the foie gras sausage. I driven past a million times when they were open during the weekday but it just didn't feel right. My fiancee and I had some time to kill, it was a warm day with a few raindrops and we were in the neighborhood, so luckily she mentioned Hot Doug's and it just felt right. The line was, as usual, long and to the alley around the corner. We waited in line for about an hour and the the feeling of anticipation definitely came over us, especially when we actually set foot in HDs. We figured out what we wanted and got to the front where Doug (I presume that's the owner's name, lol) graciously took our order. We got the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and fleur de sel, the cognac-infused pheasant sausage with chive-dijon goat's butter and duck rillettes and an order of duck fat fries (an order is def big enough for two). The foie gras and duck sausage was one of the tastiest things I have ever had in my entire life. Bar none. I've said this in the past but I thoroughly enjoyed this and could have had two. The foie gras mousse was creamy and a perfect topping for the juicy and delicious encased sausage. The truffle aioli was a great touch and whatever fleur de sel is I know I liked it cuz it was somewhere in the tasty thing. A encased meat like this needs a good bun and the bun HDs used was perfect. The cognac-infused sausage was just as good. Different than the foie gras but so tasty. The chive-dijon butter was perfect and the moist duck rillettes sitting on top of the sausage was a fantastic touch. The duck fat fries were pretty good. You could taste a bit of the duck fat but it wasn't like the fries really stood out from regular fresh cut fries. Very good fries but I was expecting to be blown away. HDs really is like having a four-star meal in an encased meat. The specials are well worth the price. I like the fact that they have regular dogs that you can fry, grill, steam or char along with different kinds of sausages (andoille, thuringer, etc), corn dogs, a veggie dog, etc. There are so many specials that change each week along with the celebrity sausage (named after a celebrity of course) and the game sausage of the week (today was yak sausage with bacon-garlic aioli). I'm already planning my next trip - I'll not have a problem waiting in line again."
1691,"I guess this review is more for my benefit than for Yelp's...704 reviews holy crap! I was driving ""through"" Chicago (Naperville to Milwaukee--slight detour) and figured this was my last chance to go to Hot Doug's since I'm quitting my travel-heavy job next month. So I went, it was chilly and raining and the line really wasn't too bad. It was about 1:30 and the end of the line was maybe 5 or 6 people outside the door. I had been expecting worse and I had an umbrella, so happy day. Unfortunately I was alone, so I couldn't split a bunch of dogs with a bunch of friends and just ordered one of the specials: whiskey and fennel sausage with a red pepper mayo and burning nettles cheese (whatever that is). It wasn't a life-changing experience but it was damn good and definitely worth $8. I wouldn't order it again if only because there are so many other dogs I want to try! I think what impressed me most about this place was that when I got to the front of the line, the guy (Doug himself, I presume?) was totally friendly and patient. Back east the guy at the front of that line would be an angry, condescending asshole and people would love him for his arrogance, but at Hot Doug's I got service with a smile. Just one of the many reasons I really, really, really like Chicago. Thanks, Doug."
1692,"For the past, oh, 5 years I have wanted to come to Hot Doug's, but those ridiculous lines have always scared me away. But not today!! It was 3PM on a Wednesday and we were in the area...on a whim we decided to hit up Hot Doug's - and there was no line...woo hoo! Best split decision ever. Since there was no line there wasn't much time to decide on anything fancy, so we stuck to the basics - we each got a Chicago dog, he also got a Polish, and we split a large cheese fries and Doug himself even convinced us to save some change and share a small drink instead of a large...""There's free refills! No line! Gotta take advantage!"" Our entire lunch was $10. Whoa. The food was awesome, but next time I think I need to splurge on some fancy sausage. Now that I know the secret of avoiding the long lines, I'll definitely be back."
1693,"HOT DOUG'S never fails me! As a Chicagoan, it's hard for me to NOT order Chicago Dogs. Every time I visit, I always make a stop at Hot Doug's and order at least three different types of sausages and one dog. The wait is a part of the experience and every experience has been amazing. Quick tip for foodies: Don't eat Hot Doug's before going to Alinea. I learned the hard way. LOL!"
1694,"This place is awesome and totally worth the wait. We stood in line for about 45 minutes (luckily I think this is a shorter wait than usual) and got it just in time before the close. We ordered up two dogs duck fat fries, and drinks. Heavenly! The foie gras and duck sausage dog was totally worth the $8 or whatever it cost. Great texture. The duck fat fries were nice and crispy with a lot of flavor. Reminds me a bit of In-n-Out fries in terms of 'freshness' but the crispy part really takes it to the next level. If we ever make it back out to Chicago, we'll definitely have to make time to stop by Hot Doug's again. There's a reason why this place is listed as the number one hot dog joint in the nation. I'd have to agree with that sentiment."
1695,"My expectations for this place was at about an 11 However, the food was only a 9. I guess I put a lot of pressure on this place. Sorry Hot Doug's. hint: They had a foie gras with truffle oil hot dog!!"
1696,"What can I say that hasn't already been said... I love my sausages on a bun.. some without a bun, but none the less.. LUV EM LUV EM LUV EM I am not a huge fan of duck, BUT the duck fat fries are a wonder I can not resist.. YUM!"
1697,"Gotta love Doug. He is the nicest cashier ever. One would never know that this guy runs a place that has become world renowned, is featured on tv shows, magazines, newspapers, etc. This guy is down to earth and just plain happy. Regardless of the awesomeness of the dogs and sausages, he makes the place what it is. So on to the food.....we had the saucisse toulouse with anchovy butter, which was salty (as it should be) and savory. Then on to the atomic dog. Whoa that baby is hot but then combined with the cheese and raspberry mustard, it is just a genius combo. Because we got there at 10:00 on a Tuesday we were in and out in short order and I cannot wait to make the trip out again."
1698,"Are you all out of your minds? It's a flippin hot dog stand!!! I've tried most of the regular dogs and a few specialty sausages and they are good but certainly not worth waiting in line for more than 10 minutes let alone an hour. And yes I've had the duck fat fries(a few years ago early and only waited 10 minutes). Are the fries good? I guess but it's a flippin french fry. Don't get me wrong, I like the place and Doug is really nice but something is going on in Avondale. I think it's something in the water making you fools wait in line for an hour for sausages and burgers from Kuma's."
1699,"I am sure, when (yes, when) I go here again, I'll give it another star. I found the exact right time to go where there were only two people (TWO!) in front of us in line. And I'm not telling ya'll what day or time that is. I had the Elvis (polish sausage) with sauerkraut and a cheese fry. It was quite tasty - the sourkrauty is a little...pickley tasting - more sour than sweet, but I really liked it. And the fries are pretty high quality. My dining companion had a Bratwurst and she was quite thrilled with it. Yum."
1700,"My wife isn't a strict vegetarian, but doesn't eat beef or pork. Since moving back to Chicago she's seen me eat a good share of hot dogs and confessed the other day that she kind of wished she could have one with all the fixin's. Hot Doug's veggie dog finally gave me a reason to stand in line and check the place out first hand and score some points with the wife. She, of course, went with the veggie dog and was happy to get her fix without crossing the beef/pork line, while I decided to sample the special - ostrich with strawberry dijonaise and some fancy smoked Spanish cheese that I couldn't pronounce. I like trying new things, so they can earn five starts for that alone. Good stuff. I also talked her into splitting the duck fat fries - I didn't notice anything special as far as the taste, but I did polish off the entire basket whereas I usually get bored about halfway through a bag of fries from a regular fast food joint. Sure it seems silly to wait almost an hour for hot dog and I wouldn't do it every weekend, but I'll definitely be back to sample more of the menu and support someone running a quality local business."
1701,"Ooof. This is place will make your afternoon. It's famous for its exotic tube steak and duck fries, but I've never been blown away by that stuff. Most of their specials have some kind of fine cheese and fancy mayo, not a great treatment for sausage in my opinion. I think you're better off sticking with the classic Chicago dog. They do it better than anyone. Charred and deep fried is the way to go. Of course, the line is an ordeal, especially since they showed this place on Bourdain. Stick with it. Typically they close the line down at 4, but stay open until everyone who was in line at 4 gets served -- disregard the Chads and Brosefs who might try to get you to leave the line by telling you otherwise. Oh, and if you're lucky enough to see the elusive Frankenwurst on special, you best man up... to whale cancer. F'yeah."
1702,"What an establishment with true Chi-town character! Be ready for a 2 hour wait on the weekend, especially if you want to sink your teeth into those infamous duck fat fries (may I have some ketchup and a side of Lipitor please?)! The andouille sausage, thuringer, fire dog, and specials of the day (notably the smoked debreziner) were so juicy, and spewing of flavor! They grill the dogs over fire, and you can watch everything from the open kitchen. The place screams kitsch, but I don't mind it! Doug himself works the ordering station, but was actually super nice! I thought it was going to be one of those Soup Natzi/Pat's Cheesesteak strict ordering ritual deals, but it doesn't go down like that here---and thank goodness! They really are the ""Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium""!"
1703,"These hot dogs are freakin amazing! Between my two friends and myself, we ordered 7 hot dogs. All of them were delicious, but the two really mind-blowing ones are the foie gras and the alligator dogs. Wow... Just wow. Its been almost a year since I've visited Chicago, and I still find myself thinking about this place constantly! Hot Doug's was completely worth the hour wait in line (at minimum), and the long taxi ride (as it is located a bit outside of the city)."
1704,Excellent. Loved the Duck Confit with Pork Sausage. Worth the wait.
1705,"I might as well throw in the standard ""this is amazing, oh my goodness, I could eat here everyday and live a short, amazing life filled with high cholesterol, but it would be worth it"" review. I don't care if the line is an hour or two long. I'll wait."
1706,OMG FML I WISH I WAS IN CHICAGO RIGHT NOW This place is sooooo fucking good! go on a friday or saturday to get the duck fat fries! mmmmmm make sure you go 15 min before they open cuz itll be fucking chaos!
1707,"YES!! I am the 850th Yelper to review Hot Doug's All 849 reviews are accurate. You will wait an hour+ on saturday. Doug is very nice as he takes your order. The specialty sausages are incredible ($7-$9) The duck fat fries are also incredible Seriously, if you have not gone to Hot Doug's, you need to go. 850 people can't be wrong"
1708,I don't know when this place is not busy. But go. Just go.
1709,"Oh man, just as good as I hoped. I had a Portuguese sausage with Saffron Rouille and Manchego Cheese. It was phenomenal. I didn't want to take the last bite because I was so sad to see it go. My friend got the vegetarian hotdog, which was amazing as well - she said it tasted so much like meat to her that she was worried it WAS meat. I, as a carnivore, could tell it wasn't, but it was easily the best vegetarian dog I've ever had. We also got cheese fries which were amazing, if ridiculously rich. I think we did Hot Dougs the ""right"" way - we went at an odd time (11:30 AM on a Thursday) and only had to wait for about 30 minutes, most of it inside. Your first time going, I'd recommend doing it that way - the wait really isn't that bad, and we were able to snag a table. The service was really really friendly. It was very pleasant. I wish I had been there on the weekend to try the duck fat fries, and now that I know Hot Dougs is as good as its hype, I'll be willing to wait the insane times for weekend lunch. Just. Go. This is one of those places you really can't miss."
1710,"YUM they say hunger is the best sauce, and after waiting in line at hot doug's, i definitely found this to be true. the regular dogs are good but not worth the trip or the wait. the 5-stars are for the ""special"" dogs which are all unique and delicious. best i've had was the antelope sausage with goat cheese spread, and the garlic pork with gouda, i think? de-lish. one order of duck fat fries can easily feed a group of 3 or 4."
1711,"Hot Doug's is to Awesome; as Picasso's Guernica is to Mind Blowing! With that said; I cannot stress just how important it is to go to Hot Doug's if/when you're in Chicago! Typically I launch into some over the top exasperated tale of how the food was more mind bending than a Rubiks Cube. However, in this case it's exactly like that; but I'm going stick to what I ate. First of all, I had 3 hot dogs. Not your mere mortal, entry level hot dogs; either. In fact one of them was a blend of Venison / Bison / Elk / with a Pomegranate Glaze!!! Pomegranate Glaze?!!? C'mon now. I mean, meat combos aren't a new thing but combining them with a Pomegranate Glaze and putting all of that in a bun?! Hot Doug's is Gourmet Dining at its finest whilst sitting in shorts and under a tree. Simply Put - this is a dive spot that will delectably charm your pallet. I'm from Houston, and was here during a Bachelor Party with guys from Oklahoma. Let's just say - this is where you take out of towners for a one of a kind experience. Hot Doug's you're a Genius, and I appreciate your creativity."
1712,"Hot Doug's is the best! Not to be confused with gourmet restaurants or celebrity chefs, Doug is a regular guy (probably high IQ though) who just wants to provide the best quality product in a unique and nostalgic way. He has done an superb job! I got two dogs, one special and one off the regular menu, duck fat fries and a drink. Total was like $13 bucks. Pretty reasonable i thought. Also met two young men, Andrew and Anurat, in line and shared my dogs with them so in total tried six dogs! The key here is to remember that these are just hot dogs and as far as dogs go, Doug treats them with love and tenderness. Going to Doug's was also fun. It's a little off the beaten track. Had to take the Blue line towards O'hare and then the 52 bus north but the hunt is always half the fun. Got there at opening and there were already 40 people in line but again, all the people were friendly and it was all good. Will definitely be back..."
1713,"Hate to write a me-too review, but good lord is this place good. I guess I'll say I was most surprised by the rattlesnake dog because I had never conceived of eating it before, let alone with a chipotle mayo and blue cheese crumble. And, oh yeah, get there early."
1714,"I wouldn't know if the dogs were good because I never got to try them. We left the Cubs/Dbacks game at Wrigley Field and hopped on CTA buses to get there from the game. We had been PLANNING on eating at HOT DOUGS for months and we couldn't wait. It was about to close for two weeks for vacation and we knew it was our only chance. The traffic was rough and the bus was at a stand still so we walked. We arrived at the door and saw PEOPLE EATING inside. They wouldn't let us in cuz they were about to close. It was FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON!!! The guy at the door was total vinegar and water type, Wouldn't let me and my lady in to try. I even told him I was from outta town and that I had delays on mass transit. The fact that I was from outta town made him even more of a rhymes like Mick. We got back on mass transit and missed out on HOT DOUGS. THANKS!!!"
1715,"Chicago is a hot dog town! And hot dog-it (!!!), I love Hot Doug's!!! If you were from out of town like me and have no car, your best bet is a nice long bus ride. You get dropped off right across the street, which in my opinion isn't so bad, especially since I got to have a nice look at the neighborhood and so forth. Anyway, let's get to the FOOD. So many choices up on the wall, but what you should really aim for is getting The Dog, which is just Chicago style and that foie gras dog. The fries in duck fat were only available on Friday and Saturday, so my Thursday visit was less eventful. Although those two dogs were the best I have ever had in my life. Chicago doesn't mess around when it comes to hot dogs. Also, I'm sure this place has had a lot of people come ever since it was featured on TV ... but it still feels like a regular corner joint. The guy at the front was really calm and nice and didn't seem to look down on the two fatties before him who ordered more than two hot dogs (yes, it was us). Hot dogs came up quick and tasted good. That was what we loved. I'm definitely coming back to Chicago so I can tear into this menu a little bit more. Plus I'm sure my mom would love this place because they have an Elvis dog!"
1716,"Oh. My. God. The steamed hot dogs are so freakin good. The duck fat fries are a rare treat. Sure the line is horribly long, but it's ok: the prices are incredibly cheap and so worth it. Doug is also super nice. And looks just like Jon Favreau. :)"
1717,"Dear Doug, Although I will cherish our friendship forever, I must say good bye. I'll always remembers our days of bratwursts, tall boy old styles and the Cubs over on Roscoe, but alas I just can't stomach the lines. The last time I ate at Doug's there were 2 camera crews there doing 2 separate stories. Good for Doug and Good for People who don't mind the wait. Btw, just get a hot dog there. It's the best in the city. Love always, Dan S. (I don't know how I feel about the fact that my hot dog vendor knew my name)"
1718,"Doug is a hot dog genius! And yes, they have veggie dogs. Don't be scared by the line (it's always there), and totally worth the wait! Make sure to check out the signs for the bathroom . . . the boys is a bun with a wiener, the girls is just a bun . . . it gets me every time!"
1719,"Really, I love Hot Doug's, and I'm still giving it 5 stars... but a few weeks ago, I had the mandarin orange teriyaki chicken sausage... and the bun smelled like straight-up butt. It was disappointing."
1720,"So I ventured to Hot Doug's yesterday with a friend for the first time. We went around 1pm on a Tuesday. There was a bit of a line, but big deal. How many times have you sat in traffic for 2 hours and not been rewarded with a delicious sausage. Our wait was about 30-45 minutes. Not that bad really, you can talk with the other people in line, see what they recommend if they have been here before or chat about what you are going to order. The wait also gives you some time to mull over what the heck you are going to get. While I was in line someone had mentioned that the bacon sausage was the best dog they had ever had, so at that point I was quite unsure of what to order. As we got in the door I had decided to go with the Smoked Apple Chicken Sausage with Spicy Citrus-Apple Salsa and Sartori Raspberry Cheese and I grabbed a honey lemonade because I thought it would be a nice complement to the other citrus flavors. Having Celiac disease I was forced to ditch the bun, which actually was no big deal because the sausage was big enough that the bun didn't matter. So I settled in with my knife and fork like I always do when I eat hot dogs or sausage because gluten free buns at any dining establishment are a rarity. The sausage was quite delicious, it had a nice smokey flavor and the apple salsa gave it just enough a kick. And the cheese was a nice pairing. This could just be me being American, but I would have liked more cheese and apple salsa. I also got the fries, no duckfat fries since it was Tuesday(I'll be back). So four stars for now until I go back again and try something else. I don't care about the wait, not a big deal to me. Food was good. Lots of options. Someday I hope there will be a hot dog place that offers gluten free buns..."
1721,"After a recent trip to Hot Doug's (after our first one failed due to 3hr long lines....not even exaggerating), we felt we owed this place an extensively long review lavishly extolling the virtues of their hot dogs. In fact, after we had finished devouring our meal, we could not bring ourselves to call what this establishment served as hot dogs....they were really the very physical embodiment of culinary talent that happened to be in the form of encased meat. However, a simple glimpse on yelp revealed that such an effort would simply be as redundant. The other 1200 reviews are enough to demand that anyone who has not been here do so. Yes, the lines can be long, but if done correctly (we came on a Thursday at 1pm and we only waited 20 minutes), it can be tolerable. So what are you waiting for? Btw, for the sake of completeness, this is what we had, all of which were amazingly delicious: 1. The Dog (chicago style hotdog with everything) 2. The Elvis (polish sausage) 3. The Paul Kelly (Bratwurst) 4. The Eliot Fishman (Brandy-Infused Portuguese Chorizo with Saffron Rouille and Iberico Cheese) 5. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel 6. Pear-infused elk sausage with Foie Gras Dijonnaise and Mustard-seed Gouda Cheese All topped with a large serving of fries. Heaven."
1722,"Amazing! Wonderful service, and who can beat meeting the owner each and every time you come in! When you can catch a down time there is no wait. Even if you do wait, it is definitely worth the wait for any of the encased meat you get from Hot Doug's!"
1723,"So, obviously everybody and their dog has reviewed this place and loved it. I have NEVER had anything bad there, the veggie dog isn't the best, but everything else is fan-f-ing-tastic. My favorite thing about Hot Doug's is that no matter what the line or the weather is like every. single. person. there. is happy. It is against an unwritten code to be a jerk there. I love it. In a city like Chicago where there are so many d-bags on every corner, taking sanctuary from them in a hot dog stand is heaven (and seemingly appropriate). Not only do you leave Hot Doug's feeling satisfied and full, you also leave feeling a tiny bit better about humanity."
1724,"Put on your line-waiting shoes and head to Hot Doug's, because this place completely lives up to its super-hyped reputation. You'll be in for the encased-meats experience of a lifetime. Wild boar, rabbit, even RATTLESNAKE dogs have been served here. They go beyond just weirdness; there's real artistry behind these creations. Their ""classics"" are great, too, and cheap. And the duck fat fries are extraordinary. I second the tip that some other reviewers gave: if you like hot dogs for breakfast, showing up at 10:00 is a good way to avoid the rush (although there's usually still a little wait). Also, always check the website to make sure they're open on a given day. Hot Doug likes to take holidays whenever he pleases. I say he's earned it."
1725,"The other month I told Doug that he was one of the reasons I moved to Chicago. And I was actually kind of serious. He took the ridiculous compliment in the best way a punk rock purveyor of encased meats could: he immediately told me to leave his establishment. With a huge grin on his face. I'm sure he's used to it. Doug is one of the reasons you go to Hot Doug's. He's always there, always behind the counter. Always smiling, calm, patient, and funny. I'm know that at times owning a restaurant, even one as consistently packed as this one, is incredibly difficult, and sometimes not that much fun, but you'd never know it when meeting Doug. This is some well-crafted, lovingly thought-out, inventive food. There are hot dogs here that will make you curse with delight. And at this point HD's is a part of my history: I take every single visiting friend here, without fail (they never regret not seeing the Bean instead). I have actually waited 2.5 hours in line for something like a Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Delice de Jura Cheese and I'd do it again. And I'm pretty sure that I officially fell in love with my girlfriend while sharing a Burgundy and Citrus Pork Sausage with Orange Sauce Moutarde and Morbier Cheese. It's a testament to Chicago's culinary prowess that it can support magical dining experiences like Hot Doug's, which costs a fraction of a place like [the equally creative and delicious] Schwa, and without any of the pretension you'd get elsewhere in the country. It's this culinary creativity and obvious fun being had in the preparation of food that is truly one of the reasons I moved here. So, believe me or not, Doug: thanks!"
1726,"Nothing I can say will add any additional value to the reviews already posted here .... but Goddamn .... what a place!!! At first I waited for 1 hour and 30 mins in the blistering summer heat to get in and I was almost convinced that nothing could be worth that time and effort. Boy was a wrong .... Doug is a genius, he has truly revolutionized the concept of a dog. He has taken something that was street fare and made it gourmet .... and I bet he enjoyed doing it more than I enjoyed eating them. When I finally made it into the store, the menu was a shocker ... where else do you get foie gras and spicy alligator sausages? Doug personally takes all the orders and his passion really comes across. I had 4 Dogs and an entire serving of Duck Fat Fries ..... I'm da man .... I really cannot wait to go there again .... Here's what I had : 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. 2) Ribeye Steak Sausage with Black Garlic Aioli and Double Creme Brie Cheese 3) Caribbean Goat Sausage with Spicy Prickly Pear Creme Fraiche, Roasted Plantains and Delice du Jura Cheese 4) Wild Rice and Asiago Cheese Bison Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mustard and Chimay Beer Cheese My friend and I shared the : 4.5) Cherry and Apple Pork Sausage with Sweet Curry Mustard, Cocoa Cardona Cheese and Vodka-Infused Dried Fruit I cannot wait to go back in there ..... Oh yeah, something to keep in mind, this place is cash only .... no credit cards ..."
1727,"Goodness abounds. I'm usually not too adventurous of an eater but I had a duck sausage when I went. It was great. Not only is the food good but Doug himself is a wonderful person. My roommate and I didn't know that it was cash only until we were next in line. We told Doug we didn't have cash and he told us to order, eat, and then go to the bank right down the street and come back. Super, super nice guy. You're going to have to wait in line to get in but it will be worth it to chat with Doug and to have a yummy Chicago style hot dog or one of their unique sausages."
1728,Totally worth the hour+ wait. Don't forget they only accept cash! Can't wait to visit again!
1729,If there is a line...wait in it... This place is amazing. I recommend 100 times over!!!
1730,"Everyone else has said it but I am going to say it again. Hot Doug's is the real deal. Every bit as good as you can imagine. Each bite was a revelation of taste and creativity. My friend and I decided to get 3 of the speciality dogs (which are a little more pricey) and share so we could taste more of what was to offer. This ended up being a great way to experience the glory of more than one of these unique dogs. We had chicken, alligator and bison. All fantastic. Rumor is that the duck fat fries are amazing but they only serve them on the weekends. So that is good to know. Also, for obvious reasons, Hot Doug's is very, very busy. Going right when they open or about an hour before they close will save you a lot of wait time (we went around 3pm and only waited for about 15 minutes). Also, make sure to bring cash so you don't end up like the girl in front of us who waited through the whole line only to come rushing back out of the restaurant pleading ""Where is the nearest ATM!!!"""
1731,"#1354.... Is Hot Doug's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? Absolutely. Would I ever wait 2 hours for it again? Probably not. I mean, come on people.... it's only a hot dog. I devoured a Chicago dog with everything, and a specialty sausage - wild boar. The wild boar sausage was garlicky and amazing. My advice is to go to Hot Doug's hungry enough to get 1 ""regular"" dog and 1 ""specialty"". I was there on a Saturday, so we got the duck fat fries b/c they were available. Call me a philistine, but they didn't rock my world. If you're there on Friday or Saturday, just get them.... but don't kill yourself just for these over-hyped potatoes. CASH ONLY."
1732,"As I waited in the 45 minute line that stretched around the corner like a Disney park ride, I looked forward to trying out the hot dogs here. The owner that actually takes your owner, was really nice and liked how he helped out with deciding on a hot dog. The hot dogs were good, but I wouldn't wait in a line like that for them. I would 100% eat there again on a slower day though (if it exists). I will say that I wish I was a bit more adventurous with the hot dogs I had and maybe I would think a little differently. As a side note, they did not have the duck fat fries the day I went so I was not able to try them. :("
1733,"Most people will say anything less than a 6 is heresy. I'll probably be looking over my shoulder for a while after posting this, but it has to be said. Hot dougs is a 5 in the same way in-and-out burger is a 5. It's popular because it has a cult following and it has a cult following because its popular. The food is average, and at some point, I'm sure it was edgy and innovative (oh my! unconventional meats in a casing!) but its nothing special. People rave about the duck fat fries, but I'll take McDonald fries before those any day."
1734,"Wow, oh wow!! Everyone talks about how good this place is and this is the 3rd attempt to actually make it in the door for me and I finally waited it out. The line on this place is always out the door and the first two times I went, the people at the front of the line said they had been waiting 2 hours. I had to come up with some kind of strategy to semi-avoid this line. I took Friday off work and went in a post lunch time, in turn only being in a 30 minute line. The line is long partly due to you will have a seat waiting for you moments after you place your order. They know what they are doing so you can sit and enjoy your food when you are done. CASH ONLY! Don't forget your CASH because it would be a little sad waiting all that time and not getting any food! Also it is for LUNCH ONLY as they close at 4PM everyday and NOT OPEN ON SUNDAY! Each day this place has gourmet specials and they are posted on their website each day; around ten each day. I recommend getting one of these specials and a corn dog to complement it. The corn dog is fresh dipped and steaming hot! The hot dog special I got was a Jalapeno & Cheese filled beef dog that was topped with Jalapeno Bacon, Jalapeno Mayo, Pinto Beans, Tomato and Onion. This was a piece out of heaven and I have never had ANYTHING close to as good of a hot dog as that. They don't stop at beef dogs either they go to deer, alligator, bison and more! Honestly, I wanted to sit there like a buffet all day. Friday and Saturday are also the only two days that have the notorious Duck Fat fries so I had to try them out. Yes, they are good. Life changing, no. So don't cry over no duck fat fries on other days of the week, you will be just fine! The hot dogs are really where it is at. For years, I have wanted to go to this place as it has always been talk of the town as well as been on multiple TV shows. I reserve my five star reviews for something that blows me away and this sure did it. I am heading back again this weekend! I am just scared for the winter when I have to wait out in the cold. Hey Doug, do you have VIP line passes available for sale??"
1735,"Hot Doug's has done more to further my goal of eating one of every animal on the planet than any other establishment! Where else can you get sausages like antelope, alligator, duck, rattlesnake, crawfish... there's so many and they change so often you could go every day! Not only that but paired with the kinds of sauces you'd find in an upscale restaurant gracing ""fancier"" meats and cheeses like aged gouda. Not only is the food wonderful but Doug and his entire staff are great. The fact that Doug welcomes me into his store on a first name basis every time I go in only reminds me how much I love this place and the people that work there. I swear, he knows everybody and treats everyone that steps in like an old friend."
1736,"Their motto: There are no two finer words in the English language than ""encased meats,"" my friend. And they prove it. I used to live 1 mile away, now I live 4 miles away. Winter or Summer, there is always a line. The duck fat fries are not really what they are cracked up to be. But imagine foie gras dogs, ostrich, and every other type of meat you could imagine, in a sausage casing. With brie, Gorgonzola, and any number of other fine cheeses. And you can even get a Chicago red hot or Polish, it you don't mind waiting in line for 1/2 hour for it. I vote them Best Sausage in Chicago, by far.."
1737,"I know Chicagoans are crazy for hot dogs but I never realized it until I saw the line for Hot Doug's. I was told this was *the* place to check out while I was there and I'm glad I piled in line for it. The sheer amount of available ""encased meats"" can be overwhelming for a first timer but I was able to find my selection before I got to the counter. I ordered one of the specials of the day (can't remember which) but it was delicious! I can almost still taste it and I haven't been there in a week! I would almost pay someone to have one personally delivered to me down in FL. Yummy!"
1738,"So what's so great about a hot dog? What's NOT great about a hot dog from Hot Doug's! I have only been here twice, most recently, just yesterday. I have tried a few of their sausages, but due to their unique names I have trouble recalling. When I hopped on over with a coworker earlier this week, I sampled the gator dog - Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Goat Cheese. Absolutely delicious. Smoked? Good. Spicy? Good. Smoked and Spicy? GREAT. And did someone say goat cheese? And how! The ample amounts of feta on my dog made this girl's mouth water. Can't wait to steal away again to that lovely corner of Roscoe and California =)"
1739,"What to say? ""Just get a couple of regular dogs and an order of fries and you have a delicious meal for like $5."" I'm broke and like to think that. I always end up getting two special sausages and fries and spending some dough. So should you."
1740,"Hot Doug's is as good as it gets. Whether you go with friends and wait in line, or sneak in the door right before close (PS, there is usually a limited line there are this time on Mon/Tues/Wed), it is always a pleasure to get to go to this fine Chicago establishment. I would like to ask yelp to increase their rating system another 5 stars for the fact that Doug is there every day, greeting every customer. If he's not there? They're closed. That's pretty rare in this day and age. Bring real money, they don't take credit cards. Doug, I will see you later on."
1741,"Dear Hot Doug's, First off i want to apologize, Yelp will only allow me to give you up to 5 stars.. but if it was up to me, i will give you infinity. When my friends and i planned out our vacation to Chicago, we knew we had to make room for this place even if it meant standing in line for hours. We got lucky because we came here on a Monday morning at exactly 10:29 a.m. and there are about 10 people in line already. The owner Doug greeted us with a smile and took our orders. We didn't have to wait too long for our orders. Here's what we ordered 1) The Paul Kelly-Bratwurst soaked in beer - This was ok,I feel there could have been more flavor to this but there wasn't much to it. i could kind of taste the beer but my friends can't. But i love the cheese the put on it. they put the brie and goat cheese on it. 2) The Rabbit- it was my first time having rabbit and it didn't taste like chicken as i expected.. It was a little heavy .. i didn't really like this one 3) the Cheesy atomic- This was one was very good, even if it was super spicy.. i ended up downing almost to cups of coke because it was really hot. The best part about this one is the passion fruit sauce they put in it.. it was so tasty, a perfect combo of spicy and sweetness 4) Curry Pork Sausage- this one was pretty good too, it wasn't as spicy as the cheesy atomic. but it still gave the perfect kick 5) cheese fries- i love their fries,, it tasted super fresh, but it's hard to eat it when you want to save room for their hot dogs. i love fries with the skin on it! and last but no least 6) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. all i can say is that this just totally melts when you take a bite. This is the type of food you don't want to share. You take your first bite and the next thing you know is that you are done. You can probably finish this in one minute. It's that good. i Highly suggest getting more than one, because you will crave for it the second you are done. i love this one so much.. i kept on thinking about it even in my dreams. the next time i come back to chicago, i will need to try their duck fries..i need to find out what all the craze is about!"
1742,"ahem. they be like AMY, can you teach me how to dougie? you know why, cause i eat like a fatty. all i need is some fries and foie gras and for you, you, you in the long line to get lost! i could rap some more, but no need for nauseousness before you overstuff yourself with hot dogs. my advice is this: drag yourself out of bed on the morning of a particularly potent hangover. gather your friends and wait in line for the requisite hourish. when you finally get to order, you'll be ravenous, and that grease will do wonders for your stomach. share with friends (especially the foie gras dog), and don't skip the duck fat fries. half of the fun is passing around a million hot dogs and trading bites. when my friends and i finished, we didn't eat for another 10 hours. and that's how you dougie."
1743,"I know its hard to believe but 1+ hours waiting in line for a hot dog is totally worth it. Their classic sausages are perfect. The game and special sausages are freaking awesome. Duck. Fat. Fries. Service is always awesome, dude behind the counter runs a mean shop."
1744,"The Short story: D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. Worth the wait. The Looong story: I went here for the first time today since one of my best friends was in town. I have heard so many good things about this place and I've been dying to try it. We came here earlier this summer to eat, but when we got there we found out it was closed because they were on vacation. Weird for such a popular business. Check online or call-in ahead of time to make sure they're open. So anyway, I was kinda anxious to get there because they close at 4pm, and between wrangling up my friends, getting out of the house, and finding an ATM to pick up some money (they take CASH only, keep that in mind) ... we got there at 3:30. I was kinda worried we wouldn't make the cut-off, but as people came and went from the queue, we found out we were fine. The wait was about 45 minutes. Totally worth the 30 minute conversation about halloween costumes. We finally queue to the door, we walk in, and the place itself is very cool. Just enough room to walk around, and at most maybe you can seat a table of 6 friends. Like any other Chicago food stop, it's got tons of kooky, kitschy sports and historical crap on the walls. The decor is really outrageous, primary colors abound. The menu is pretty big considering it's just sausages and encased meats, separated into ""regular"" dogs and specials. I looked at the menu online and decided ahead of time what specials wanted to try: the ""Mountain man"" and ""Catalonia"" sausage. Price-wise, it is a pretty good value. The cashier (who I am going to assume is ""Doug"" himself) was incredibly cordial, along with the waiters who seat you and bring your orders. They are super efficient and the service is very quick. Okay, here comes the best part of the whole experience, the food. Oh man. It is so great, and the meat is so perfectly spiced and prepared. I am an adamant carnivore, and they're honestly like no other sausage I've had before. And the cheese and sauces accompanying the meat so perfectly accentuate and compliment the meat. Man, oh man. Words cannot describe it, you must try it yourself. My friends also shared their duck fat fries. At first I didn't think they were too special, but once you cleanse your pallet from the delicious sausage fest and have a bunch of em in a row, you start to appreciate the special-ness and subtle ducky-ness. Very good. Can't wait to come here again and try something else."
1745,Waited in the standard line for bout 20 minutes. Inside was clean and ordering was made easy by Doug's very friendly help. Tried a couple of dogs. Great! My favorite was the affordable 2$ Chicago dog. How bout making it bigger? At 8$ a dog expansion should be on the horizon.
1746,"I've heard a lot about this place from my buddies so I wanted to try it out. Everytime we drive by, it's really busy, so we decided on whim to go one day in January when it was snowing like crazy. I couldn't believe there was still a line halfway around the block. We went on a weekend so we got the duck fat fries. Wow, just wow. Also I had to get a Chicago dog just to check it out. And of course I tried a specialty dog. I had a turkey sausage with cranberry, goat cheese(?) and something else like almonds. I don't remember cause it was a while ago, but shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiet that was good. I'll go back but I hate the wait. edit: 4/5/08 We decided to go here for a late lunch. The line was a block long, but we gave ourselves limits (if we pass that brick in 10 minutes we stay.) When we got in, we forgot about how long we had waited as the aroma filled our lungs. The ribeye steak sausage with horseradish sauce, french onions, and cheddar???????????????? Seriously, that was amazing."
1747,"I couldn't have been happier with my decision to come to Hot Doug's today. I had the Chicken sausage and fries, and it was amazing. I am excited to come back and try one of the special dogs, I figured for my first experience here, I'd try something more original. I have friends who have raved about the place, and was extremely excited to come. I got there around 2:30 and it was pretty busy, but no line out the door...thankfully! I'll definitely be back!!!!"
1748,"I hate waiting...you have to wait here most of the time from 10 min to an hour plus. I will only come here when I think the wait will be less than 15 minutes. I always order their dogs/sausages with the standard toppings they recommend. I would recommend you do the same. Also, although it seems like a lot of people do take out here, I think the food tastes a lot better if you eat it straight out of the kitchen. I have tried over 10 of their special combo sausages. I would say 1/3 of them I think are awesome and brilliant, 1/3 are good, and 1/3 I am not a fan of. I am a fan of encased meats as much as the next person, but only willing to come here with little to no wait. (cash only!)"
1749,"I remember discovering Doug's probably around my freshman or sophomore year of high school when he was on Roscoe just east of Western. When there was a fire and he wasn't going to re-open I was so sad, because Demon Dog had already closed and this had become my hot dog place. I rarely get anything extravagant, but that's because I'm so picky and honestly, I just want a polish & fries. It's cheap. It's good. Doug is so friendly. I love this place, though it can be a pain when I get a craving and forget it's a Friday afternoon and there's going to be a line. The duck fat fries are delicious. I worked for Whole Foods, and every now and then someone would go, so if you're ordering a decent amount, order ahead! I can't tell you how many times I see people walk in/walk right out while I'm stuck in line. Also, don't forget to tip! It's not just the cooks, but also the guy or girl who are bringing you the food!"
1750,"One of Chicago's Great Wonders. (a wonder because I ask who the heck would wait in line for an hour for a bloody hot dog???!!!) Finally got round to Hot Dougs to see what the hype is all about. I took the day off for my birthday and a friend was visiting from out of town and she wants to see this place for herself. The boyfriend is a cult worshipper who visits Hot Dougs at least twice a week and he's in love with Doug and the staff all know his name. He talks about Hot Dougs all the time and frankly I'm a little jealous. Why can't he be like a normal guy and be slobbering over Angelina Jolie instead. I'm taking one star off because I'm a jealous lover. Anyway, he was so ecstatic to take us to see his leader. So I don't eat pork or its by-products and though I do love hot dogs, I was not too enthusiastic about Hot Dougs to begin with because I know that most encased meats are encased in swine material. So I can't review the fancy schmancy dogs, and maybe it makes little sense that a non-pork-eating creature visits a hot dogs joint, I was assured that this place is the bomb-diggity and I said I'll give it a chance. At least I'll get a chicago style dog or chicken or vegetarian. The line: Monday afternoon, around 1pm, the line was about 45 minutes long. The bf says as a regular customer he would not wait that long, but he does not have a Monday to Friday 8-5 work schedule so he can visit his favorite sausage shrine conveniently anytime. The owner/staff: somewhat friendly, mostly catching up with the boyfriend as they have so much to talk about. The boyfriend explained that my friend and I are not pork eaters and Doug proceeded to point us the safe ones are the Chicago Dog, the Kiera (spicy) and Chicken? I think there was another one but I forgot. The Hot Dog: I had the slightly spicy Kiera Knightley, it was grilled to perfection, topped with caramelized onions, tomatoes, relish and a pickle. It was delicious. I'd say that the spiciness can be similarly achieved if I added mayo spiked with some sri racha sauce on a regular hot dog? Other than that, nothing to write home about. Pretty good and pretty cheap for pretty good. At $2.50 its better than a $4 Wiener Circle dog, but a Chicago style hot dog from Portillos is also pretty damn good and I much prefer the fries at Portillos than Hot Dougs. The Celebrity Hot Dog of the day was this spinach feta lamb and pork sausage with kalamata olives. I love greek food and would have wanted to try that had it not for my dietary restriction. But then again, I can just order from a greek restaurant, though it would not be stuffed in a sausage sock and cost $7.50. The Fries: I have to knock off another star for the fries. It was brown and chewy, like they were fried in old oil, and it got cold, and refried. Some were crispy, maybe they were all mixed together. They just don't look very appetizing, and so brown it has spleen cancer written all over it. I've had better. These were regular non duck fat fries. The boyfriend and several others have reported that the duck fat fries vary only very minutely compared to the regular ones. The Cons: At the description of Hot Dougs even before encountering it, I feel like I'm about to get ripped off. The hype and popularity seems like it is further induced by a bottleneck of a line. Everybody knows the con that they do at swanky lounges and clubs downtown where the bouncer holds up a line full of people to give the illusion that its jammed pack inside and everybody wants to get in, you get inside and its MEH. This is a similar business/marketing model, but one star is awarded for actually having a good product to sell. One star for the owner taking down every order and being really adorable but otherwise he's probably laughing gleefully inside at his cleverness. The hours and the time and the drama to getting there are really deterrent factors. The bottomline: Was it worth it? - to please/appease the boyfriend, yes - to bring visitors from out of town to see one of the wonders of Chicago, yes - to be hip and say ""I've been to hot dougs, you should too!"", yes/maybe - to kill time waiting in line if you're not hungry, yes - to a sausage lover or to eat fancy hot dogs, yes - to eat a hot dog, regular/chicago style, no - kosher and non-pork eaters, no - worth taking the day off for a hot dog? no - waiting in line 45 minutes for a hot dog? definitely not"
1751,"Hadn't been to Hot Doug's in about 2 years, so I knew I was do for a fixing of encased meat. I thought I had picked the perfect summer day, but buyer beware...if there's a Cubs game and Doug has been on a vacay for a while, there WILL be a LONG wait. I thought the line would move which it did after about an hour. As always the wait was well worth the delicious reward. I got to chat it up with Doug (I was after all wearing my I heart hot dogs t-shirt), got some tasty cream soda, a corner table in the back and the eating frenzy with the BF began. Luckily I kept my senses in control and focused on the duck fat fries and foie gras dog with truffle aioli (the first time in my 3 visits its been on the menu). Delicious. The spicy beef sausage with coca cola bbq sauce and bits of cheddar cheese on top was also divine."
1752,"Is it a shame that I have to bring Chicago natives to this place, and I'm not even from Illinois at all? I'll admit, I found this place one late night on the Food Network, and since then, I've been asking all my Chicagoans to take me here. They always looked so puzzled when there's a line -- and they should know, when there's a line, something must be good! I'm a plain jane (sorry, can't stomach the Chicago style hot doug), so I usually get the corndog to reminisce my childhood days or the Foie Gras if I'm feeling a little ritzy. Both are great, and Doug's a sweetheart. Definitely worth the wait!"
1753,"It was good, but I wouldn't say the best hot dogs ever! Not worth the 45 minute wait that I did wait for. That's coming from a girl who doesn't eat a lot of hot dogs though, but I do have to say I loved their corn dog and I had the tequila, black bean chicken sausage that was really good! Their regular french fries are not that great, and my boyfriend got a steamed dog and a grilled dog which were okay. The owner who takes your order is extremely nice though and takes time with you and helps you with your order no matter how long the line! ^_^ I loved all the hot dog paraphernalia around, gives you tons to look at, and the colors of the place are simply marvelous! :D I had a great time here as well, but I wouldn't call it the best hot dog - or maybe I'm just not a hot dog lover :P"
1754,"My boyfriend has a serious man-crush on Doug. I mean, I guess it's for good reason: if you're not a tool, Doug will estimate your bill (on the low side), which means you end up savin' some dough. Don't forget to tip, though: those cooks work hard, and Doug is ALWAYS personable with everyone. The man truly seems to love what he does. There are always lines out the door, so get there early if you can. However, if you're still in line, you're still gonna get your food. (I've heard they give a little kid a t-shirt to be the Line Police to anyone who tries to sneak up after 4.) Doug has Saturday hours, so if you DO work a 9-5 during the week, that's your best bet. The duck fat fries are winners, and I've never tried a sausage I didn't like. We will continue to stand in line for the goodness that is Doug's as long as he dishes out his encased meats."
1755,"The self-proclaimed Sausage Super Store and Encased Meat Emporium, Hot Doug's should also be home of the regenerating line. When we finally got to the front, the line behind us had grown to exactly where we were standing when we had got there an hour before. Worth the wait? Surely. I don't think I would make a habit of waiting an hour, but it's definitely part of the experience. That said - the food. Let's talk about it. The Dog (Chicago style - grilled or steamed) is a must. For under $2, there really should be no debate. The Weekly Specials are incredible. I had the Foie and Duck sausage and was in love. The sausage is salty and the foie is nice and creamy - so rich. Though, this dog is really rich and there is no way I could ever finish the whole thing (I feel like it would be perfect to share). The celebrity sausage was the Maurice White (a spicy Thai chicken sausage with a chili-garlic mustard and topped with a seaweed salad ) - which we also had. This sausage had a bite and the seaweed salad was awesome. Finally duck fat fries. Delicious? Yes. Could I taste the difference between that and regular french fries? Sad to say -- not really. Worth trying for the novelty, but not necessarily a must."
1756,"O to the M to the G. Finally made it to this mecca of hot dog joints on a cold October morning. Showed up at 12pm on a Saturday (bad idea)...waited for 1.5 hours in shorts (just came from a run to lessen the absurd amount of calories I was about to devour). By the way, great crowd of people to wait in line with-friendly, hilarious & hungry. The group behind us brought a six pack of beer-very smart people...I'll be stealing that idea on my next Doug run. In my tummy!...ordered the Dave Kingman (Sante Fe chicken sausage-little bit of a kick to it!), the B.L.T. (who knew bacon sausage even existed?!), and a corndog. I loved the corndog-great breading & perfectly deep fried. (Can't beat it for $1.50!) The B.L.T. had the perfect mix of coleslaw & cherry tomatoes but I didn't really get that ""bacony"" taste. The duck fat fries were yummy...perfect ratio of crunch to soggy! Doug was even there to take our order!"
1757,"This has got to be the best place for encased meats in all of Chicago. Friday and Saturday fries are awesome. Yes, it's a meat lover's paradise (hey, I'll gladly go to a vegetarian place any day of the week), and they know it - the variety here is incredible. I don't know if I'm brave enough to face a line in winter, but I've done the two hour wait during the summer on a Saturday (there's an ice cream truck that just parks there - know your customers!). So, if you go there on a weekend (in the summer) bring either a lot of friends for convo while waiting, or a good book. Oh, and remember to bring cash, no credit (a couple of guys ahead of me had to leave the line after 2 hours finding out only by the register that it's cash only)."
1758,"So I finally made it out to Hot Doug's today before they close for the holidays (I believe they're closed from Dec 25th through Jan 4th ish - check their website). Luckily, our wait started inside the first door so we didn't have to stand outside in the cold but after the meal I had, I wouldn't have minded at all. The atmosphere is very retro, lots of hot dog stuff, and I love that Doug takes your order and he was extremely pleasant to talk to. Between our group we ordered 3 different dogs: 1. Kiera Knightly (Fiery Dog) - SO GOOD. The beef is seasoned just right, I don't know how he does it. 2. Tequila Chicken with Jalapeno Mayo and Habenero Pepperjack Cheese and Beans - I was a little weary of this one but the chicken was delicious. 3. Dave Kingman - amazing as always says the husband The fries are just what you'd expect from a joint like this. Maybe nothing absolutely amazing, but not short of great either. Can't wait to go back there. They only accept cash. If I could think of one improvement, it would be to change their hours so I could go there more often."
1759,"This is probably review 989......but I could not pass up the chance to RAVE about Hot Doug's! As I was walking to school one fine Thursday Morning, my bestest friend Ginger D., sends me a text stating we must satisfy our craving for greasy food. I voted 'Hot Doug's' as I saw the establishment on the Travel Channel's ""Hot Dog Paradise"" and have been itching to go for the last 6months! The promise of going to Hot Dougs kept me warm and happy through my morning classes and my walk home in 10degree weather. We arrive at 'Hot Doug's' at 1:30ish pm on a Thursday- yes there was a small wait, of about 10min. While waiting to order we observed that there was a menagerie of people dining at Hot Doug's, eagerly lapping down their lunch. Our time to order had arrived- I was a little star struck to see Doug! He was very warm and patient when it took me a few minutes to decide how I wanted my Pete Shelly (the veggie dog) cooked- definitely not like some other hot dog places where they will YELL at you if you cannot spit your order out in 35seconds. I decided on the flame grilled Pete Shelly, ketchup only and fries. My Pete Shelly was GOOD, the bun was light and tasty (NOT soggy), they did not skimp on my ketchup and the veggie dog was FLAMED GRILLED not ""burned through the skin"". The fries were good, a BAD bit below ""Five Guys"" quality fries but good none the less. ! I forgot to mention the price- a full, yummy tasty meal (1 Pete Shelly, 1 small fry and 1 small drink) for UNDER $6 cannot be beat. All prices include tax for those challenged by math ;) I have two other mini complaints, 1. NO bottled water! yes yes you can purchase a fountain soda and get water but its not the same and 2. CASH ONLY!!!!!!! For a girl that lives and breathes by her debt card this was very sad but thankfully I was aware before I embarrassed myself. I love Hot Doug's! I say its a good thing they are so far away or I would waste hours of my life waiting in line and thousands of calories on the deliciousness that is their food."
1760,"Oh, Doug. I am a true believer. I've been to Hot Dougs several times, and each time I have something different. The menu changes on a weekly basis, so there's always new goodies to try. There's also always about an hour long wait that wraps around the outside of the building if you go at peak meal times (yes, even in the freezing cold) so go prepared and dress appropriately. Also, I've never had their regular Chicago dog or the permanent menu items. I figure if I'm going to wait that long, I need to be waiting for something I can't get anywhere else. I think the duck fat fries are a little overrated. They're a little too greasy for my liking, and the regular fries with the cheese sauce are so delicious I don't see the reason for paying extra for something that I can't even taste the difference in. Keep in mind it's cash only. There are many times the group ahead or behind me noticies the ""Cash only"" sign at the register after waiting for an hour and have to run and find an ATM (which isn't available onsite). Doug is always maning the cash register, and he's always super friendly. I mean, you would be too if your customers are forking over $8 (worth it)for a hotdog...in cash. I really just love this place. It's definitely a place you have to try at least once."
1761,"WOW!!! Did I hit the jackpot with the tasty Hickory Smoked Cajun Pork Sausage, served with Muffaletta Mustard & Oregon Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey. Once the order was placed it arrived to my table in less then 4 minutes. You can glance around and see other hot dog consumer's eating selections because you just might have to try something new each visit, so take notes :) Hot Doug's is the sausage superstore and encased meat emporium of Chicago. With odd hours MON-FRI 10:30AM-4PM closed on Sundays. Also famous for having the longest lines that wrap around the building and down the block. Luckily for me I was fourth in line and the rest just had to wait!"
1762,"The bread - regular hot dog bread The sausage - a little bland, maybe so we can enjoy the toppings more? The toppings - Great, delicious, unique We ordered 3 sausages, foie gras, Saucisse de Toulouse and the uber garlic which was the celebrity of the day. The sausage was a little bit on the bland side, but the delicious toppings made up for it. Maybe that was the intention? I don't know but the hot dog as a whole was good. I wish I lived in Chicago so that I can try all their specials."
1763,"Waited in line for 1 hour outside the door (on a Saturday, at 2pm, in 30 degrees + blowing rain/snow), then waited about 1/2 hour inside, just to get to order. The waits were absolutely worth it. Traditional dogs were the best I've had in the city. Exotic hot dogs were also fantastic. The BLT Dog tasted just like the sandwich. Duck Fat fries are, as everybody else is saying on Yelp, amazing and are a must try. The owner is extremely friendly and made me easily forget how cold my fingers and toes were. You must go. Bring a group of friends whom you need to catch up with, because you'll have plenty of time."
1764,"Doug is a great guy and will get you in a conversation before you know it. The quality of the sausages are great. The duck fat fries, phnomenal. The art, very creative and amusing. That said, a 200-person line at 2:30 pm? After an hour of driving, it can get frustrating."
1765,"Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, my favorite place to eat in Chicago. It never disappoints. Go early. Try to go during the week. Yes, the wait in line is worth it--if you get sausages. I recommend not getting a regular hot dog and going for the sausages. (For regular Chicago hot dogs, hit up Superdawg.) The foie gras and duck sausage is my all-time favorite--absurdly delicious and decadent. I also like the rattlesnake and the spicy thai chicken sausages. The infamous duck fat fries are really good, but perhaps a tad overrated and hyped-up."
1766,"Finally know what all the hype is about. Friday's Duck Fat Fries! The flavors of the Foie Gras sausage were much more subtle than I expected. I could taste the duck sausage but it was nothing like a pork or beef sausage. The subtleness was obviously intended because the flavors of the foie gras mousse is also on the lighter side. A gourmet hot dog indeed for $9...what a deal. Coolness, they also have your less expensive typical ""Chicago Style Hot Dog"" for $1.75 with all the fixings."
1767,"Thankfully, we avoided the famed 3 hour line (ours was more like 30 minutes). Thankfully because if I had waited 3 hours in line for these dogs, plus paid $7-$9 for them, I would have been significantly more perturbed. As it is, though, I'm satisfied - no more, no less. The dogs were about as interesting as one would expect, given their exotic ingredients - but not crazy well cooked, nor, it seemed, was there too much thought given to the flavor combinations. The much whispered about foie gras/duck sauternes sausage was... ducky. (Sorry.) Not exceptionally flavorful, and it could have used something apart from duck to set off the duck flavors. The pork/blue cheese combo similarly could have used much, much more blue cheese... but it was good anyhow. The winner of the day was the crayfish/pork dog, which was almost too thick for the bun and bursting with shards of smoked crayfish flesh, which were in turn buried in remoulade. This dog was the one the three of us fought over. The one we all wanted to be our last bite. We gobbled down the other two and stared wistfully at the crayfish, waiting for it to be our turn. If everything was as good as that crayfish, sure, I'd be waiting in the line around the block with my $9 ready like everyone else. As it is, I'm kinda miffed about the price, and cautiously optimistic about returning to see if there are any other hidden gems. But I'm going to come at really weird times of the day. Definitely not at noon."
1768,"It was good, but not as good as I expected...faulted again for overly high expectations! nooooo! I had one of the specials - the Caribbean Goat sausage. Sounded great, and the actual sausage was great...just wasn't that much of a fan of the mystery cheese on it. Kind of ruined it for me, but the meat saved the day I guess...no, the duck fat fries saved it. They were outstanding. Everyone else I was with loved their meal too. We arrived at 10am, they opened at 10:30 and I'm pretty sure we were eating by 11am. Not bad for a Saturday morning!"
1769,Doug is one of the nicest guy's known to man. No one can beat his dog's!!! I'm so sad I don't live down the street on Roscoe anymore! I can't tell you how many times I've come in and he's given me a break when I've run out of cash. He also puts up with my little momma that loves to talk his ear off when he's trying to manage that massive line that wraps out the door and goes allllll the way down to the alley. Only thing that makes me sad is that he closes at 4 and I get out of work at 4:45 most days. WAHH! KEEP IT UP DOUG!!! I think your place is so unique and I forgot to mention that he plays the best music ever and has the most stylish glasses............one more thing.......he has this waitress that is one of the meanest most cold hard B***hes eve! His guy waiter is so nice and awesome though! :) You should give him a raise DOUG!
1770,"Not only the best hot dog place anywhere but simply one of the best restaurants in the country. The flavor profiles and taste matching are superb, the work of a team of people with some serious culinary skill. The foie gras and duck sausage dog is hands down one of the 5 best things I have ever tasted. If i lived anywhere near this place I would have 5 a week. Duck fat fries are great. Small seating area but the turnover is rapid and you can usually find a place. Expect long lines at any time but it is beyond worth the wait."
1771,"I had an amazing chicken chipotle hot dog with kiwi-mango salsa. Absolutely amazing and terrifying at the same time - it was spicy and a lot of flavors all at once. But it was definitely more manageable than I thought, and the duck fat fries are a MUST - don't listen to the haters! Come here early, and come here not in the middle of the day over the weekend. It sucks that the duck fat fries are only available Friday and Saturday, but maybe it's a crowd control measure... Being inside this place was surreal after I had seen it on TV. Doug is a sweet dude, and everyone wants to be BFFs with him so don't mind the little ladies who try to talk to him for 10 minutes in front of you."
1772,"100th Review! When your friend tells you that there is still an hour long line in the middle of Chicago winter, you know this place has to be good. I can't say that I loved hot dogs until my last trip to Chicago and I tried Portillo's Chicago dog, and it was love at first bite. So I now have a new love for meat in a tube. Doug's was a quick bus ride, and as expected the line was wrapped around the building. With 4 of us eating, we all decided we would each order 2 and all share. We stragetically planned our meal, and of course with duck fat fries. Duck fat fries, what? Holy fried goodness! These were delicious, not oily or greasy at all. Perfection! I have to say my favorite dog was the Pecan-Smoked Jalapeno Pork Sausage with Mustard Girl Horseradish Mustard, Fried Tortillas and Chihuahua Cheese. Oh man, I'm still dreaming of it. The following is my other favorites, in order... Bacon Cheeseburger Beef Sausage with Cherry Coke BBQ Sauce, Smoked Cheddar Cheese and Crispy Fried Onions Smoked Portuguese Linguica with Saffron Rouille and Aged Iberico Cheese, The Teuben: Swiss Cheese-Stuffed Corned Beef Sausage with Russian Dressing, Sauerkraut and Swiss Cheese. Doug, I love you and I can't wait to come back!"
1773,"Heading to Chicago, my friends and I had to do some research on places to hit up while we were in town. We found out about Hot Doug's and heard it was a must do. We went on an early Friday morning and stood outside in the freezing cold for about an hour or so. (Hey, we're from the south! But it was seriously the coldest day of that whole weekend). We finally made it in through the door and out of the cold only to wait some more. The place is long and narrow, definitely a tight squeeze and not good for big groups. I with 3 other guys ordered about 9 different dogs to get the best sampling. After all it's not often that you get to try something as unique as Hot Doug's does it. We got a few off the original menu and some off the specials menu. And to our delight we came on the right day! Duck-fat fries were available!! (available only on Friday and Saturday in case you're curious) Unfortunately I cannot recall the names of the dogs. I myself got the Bratwurst and Chicken sausage. The chicken sausage dog wasn't really all that great but the Bratwurst was excellent. The other dogs were interesting and good. The fries didn't really taste all that different from regular fries but I suppose it's worth checking it out. Overall I would say this is a place to go every once in awhile. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about but as a tourist I'm glad I got a chance to go."
1774,"The owner of Hot Doug's, Doug Sohn, has not let his success go to his head. He remains a kind and humble man. He is front and center in his business, always manning the cash register with a smile, ease and grace. His employees are super sweet too. The hot dogs, even the cheap ones, are delicious. I always get two Keira Knightley's for $2.50 a pop...mmmighty hot. Thanks Doug!"
1775,"Dear Doug, I think I love you."
1776,"As I rounded the corner to hot dougs, I was worried because I saw people outside the door. I drove around more and saw that the line continued. With more driving, I realized the line was more than a freaking hundred feet long. It was 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, mind you. Fast forward an hour and a half later, its 3:00 and I'm starving. We finally get to the front counter to order. Wtf, 1 person taking orders? I peeked in the back and 3 guys were cooking. Coming from 7 years at in n out burger, I know the Snyders would be turning in their graves at such inefficiency. It seems like the large crowd is slowly allowed to filter into the restaurant via 1 cash register. Think a la 300, where the spartans held off the Persians by using the narrow terrain. So after an hour and a half of waiting I ordered an order of duck grease fries, cheese fries, a corn dog, and regular hot dog. After so much hype, sad to say it wasn't the best hot dog and fries I've ever tasted. It was OK. Even if I had waited for only 10 minutes, I still would think it was only OK. If I were to rate the items separately out of 5 stars: Corndog: 4 Hotdog: 3 Cheesefries: 5 Duck fries: 4"
1777,"Not worth the wait or the tremendous attitude of the staff. Rude, discourteous and hostile are not characteristics one should ever encounter in a restaurant. There are too many other good places... I say spend your money elsewhere."
1778,Been here plenty of times. I still remember the old location on the other side of western. Great food and service. i come here whenever i get a chance. The Special sausages are great but my all time favorite is the grilled chicago style. definitely worth the wait if you have the time.
1779,"I think Hot Doug's is more about the new and different, rather than super taste. After waiting half an hour (Saturday morning) to get into the door, and while looking at the menu, there was no way for me of actually visualizing what I was about the receive. I've never tried most of the sausages, let alone the exotic toppings that went with it. After randomly choosing a dog that sounded different but decent, we waited. I was surprised when I received my dog. I've never seen or tried anything like it, but it was good. The tastes were different, unique and tasty. But more than the dog, the duck fat fries were awesome. The texture and cut of the fry reminded me of In N' Out fries, but the duck fat gave it a duck fat taste. (I couldn't taste it, but that's how a friend described it). I was pleasantly surprised, however I feel that a place that serves something really good, end up only serving that item. Hot Doug's has an extensive menu, but nothing was absolutely out of the world superb. But it was an experience."
1780,"As you stand outside of Hot Doug's at the rear of what is almost always a meandering line, an uncontrollable excitement will start to bubble from within. While others bounce out of the restaurant so filled with pleasure and you creep into position you will involuntarily enter a pre-meal euphoric state. I usually spend this agonizing wait will perusing the menu digitally and planning what could easily become my death row meal. Having enjoyed the Chicago dog, spicy jerk sausage, froie gras dog, and duck fat fries, among others I have to say ""This is f'ing it!!"" Despite the bustling surroundings, it is the kind of experience that you want to hold on to and just let it sit like a sweet candy on the tongue.. What new can even be said that hasn't already been expressed by a thousand other giddy Hot Doug's lovers. All I can add is that this is the standard by which I now judge other purveyors of tubular shaped meat. It is also the place that has inspired new ways to embellish and prepare food at home. When the palette is challenged in such unexpected and rewarding ways I can easily say that a trip to Chicago will always be garnished with a Hot Doug's feast!"
1781,"The line is a little out of control - and being my first time in chicago i decided i'd keep it traditional and order it chicago style. i loved the soft steamed bun, and all the typical chi-town style toppings, but was it worth the 3.5hour wait in the cold??? im not sure. I think its a better spot to get gourmet style burgers rather than traditional, and if i could guess why it takes so long id say a part of it would be the guy at the register who was super chatty with everyone ( whcih was very nice and refreshing, dont get me wrong.... )but hey, when you have a line thats wrapped around the corner i THINK you could afford to not chat it up with everyone and maybe get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th register...just a thought."
1782,Have you guys heard? This place is good. You have to wait in line. Tony Bourdain went here. It is the number one tourist attraction in Chicago. What more is there to be said about Doug? I don't know. You just have to experience what this place is all about and you will get it. And that is because Doug gets it. This place celebrates the sausage in new and exciting ways. That's what she said. word.
1783,"So, We went there last week on a Saturday and sure enough there was a line out the door for-everrr away. We ended up waiting a little over an hour. ugh! But we saw the place on Anthony Bourdain's and hadn't tried it before... So we waited it out since we had nothing better to do. Ended up trying the duck fat fries, which my fiance liked, but I thought they tasted like regular fries-- nothing special. We tried 5 encased meats total-- the typical hot dog and a couple of the specialties. I had the Irish Bangor which was awesome--had Guiness Mustard on it and yummy cheese. I think my man had that Wild Boar... Overall, definitely tasty. Worth the money. The owner was super cool and didn't rush people. But, the wait, well it sucked. It was like waiting for a ride at Great America. But, if you can get there on a day that isn't terribly busy, I think it's worth it."
1784,"If only all restaurants were this simple and awesome. Hot Doug's principally does one thing--encased meats--and because they hone in on that one area, they've perfected it. From the foie gras sausage to straight-forward Chicago dog, I've had pretty much everything, and it's all awesome. The duck-fat fries are good, but I prefer to focus on the wieners. Ha ha, I said ""weiners."" The one star I left off is for attitude. Yeah, this place is awesome, but maybe the owners could do their legions of fans a favor and expand their meager hours, take credit cards, open another location--anything that makes it easier for everyone to get their meat fix. All these limiting factors make it seem Hot Doug harbors this meat-elitist attitude that Chicagoans are DAMNED LUCKY to be getting their precious wieners AT ALL, and they should just SHUT UP, EAT and be HAPPY about it."
1785,I would typically write a review about how fantastic their dogs and duck fat fries are but my mouth is watering too much to continue this review. Two tips: dress to be standing outside for two hours and bring cash (I learned both the hard way)
1786,"I waited an hour and a half in line at Hot Dougs, which is a lesser than usual wait. This place is totally worth it. I had a crayfish plus something sausage, which was AMAZING. The entire menu was amazing.... I didn't realize that you can get so creative with sausages. The Selma Hyeck dog had some large lumps of fat, so there were two bites that weren't all that enjoyable, but everything else was just amazing. You can taste the really cool meat combinations in each hot dog. Service was sooo friendly and warm as well. While I probably won't go regularly because the wait is a killer, it's worth it to go at least once to try and also again if you have out-of-towners visiting and want to show them amazing dogs and sausages."
1787,"Loved it! Foie gras was interesting, good if you like it, but a bit much for me. Enjoyed the spicy dog. Hubby LOVED it even more (he wants me to give 5 stars, I had a hard time deciding!) - said he agreed with the rest, best veggie dogs he's ever had! On one he got horseradish havarti cheese - so good! Line was to the end of the building, took about 30 min to place order, but didn't feel too bad. Also, like the choice that you can either get an upscale dog, which is kind of pricey, or stick with the basic meats, which are cheap. Wish you had longer hours, but we'll still be back!!!"
1788,"I am very disappointed that I have never visited this place sooner. I have lived in Chicago my entire life and never visited Dougs. I did so on Friday, and let me say, it was awesome! There was a bit of a wait outside, but the weather was decent, and it moved fairly fast. We got in line probably about 3:40 and the restaurant closes at 4. Well, we finally got in and order at 4:00pm and they werent even trying to rush people out of the place. In fact, Doug made us feel like we could stay as long as we wanted! I was just so pleased when ordered our delicious meal and Doug greeted us with a smile and some jokes! You can tell he puts care into his establishment. The fries are top notch and fresh, and the sausage - is other-worldly. Try the Atomic Bomb, the combination of HOT spices and fruit infused cheese is awesome. Will be back again!"
1789,"TWO HOURS. I would give this review five stars if not for the wait. I get that there's a wait, but when you pick the only day of the week to NOT accept take-out orders...*sigh*. Doug was there to receive everyone's order. When I was up, he managed to make me feel like his total undivided attention was on my order. Not the five cooks behind him or the three servers/bussers roaming around. Of course, I had to get one of the specialty dogs. Checked out the buffalo version topped with blue cheese. Yeah, I also got me some duck fat fries. Did you know they serve Gus? That's Grown Up Soda for those of us that either dine at a Thomas Keller establishment *or* find themselves chillin' at Whole Foods. Dry pomegranate was a perfect counter to my meal. Oh yeah, this is embedded in residential. Take a taxi or rent a car. DO NOT WALK. Take it from someone who should've known better."
1790,"I went again on a Friday afternoon. After standing in line for an hour, I ordered the foie gras sausage and duck fat fries. I can't tell the difference between regular fries and duck fat fries, but they were awesome regardless. And this is from someone who normally doesn't like fries. The foie gras sausage was really, really tasty. Expensive at $9 for a ""hot dog"" but definitely worth trying. I wish I could have tried more, but I was planning on eating out for dinner so I had to hold back. This place is an experience and I love how different the menu offerings are. I mean, where else can you sample foie gras, elk, ostrich, etc, but still be in the middle of a hole in the wall while wearing flip flops and a tank top?"
1791,"By now, you know all about this place. Yeah, I stood in line for 100 minutes, but it was as fantastic as you have read. Our choices: Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Beer-Washed Truckle Cheese Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Vintage Cheddar Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris Besides the fresh encased meats, the toppings are of such a great quality. That's real cheddar on there -- not some factory-made, day-glo-orange Kraft krap. All 4 dogs, 2 drinks and fries for $40. Best bang for the buck anywhere. Duck fat fries? I've said it before, but I don't get it. Tip: if you can, order ahead and get it take-out. Had I known, I would've, and they post the specials on their web site. Which is nice, too, because I can check it out from a 1000 miles away and vicariously enjoy the variety."
1792,"A victim of watching cable television hungry and seeing the hot dogs and fries deep fried in duck fat made this a must try when in Chicago deal. Read about the lines, and found out they only serve the duck fat fries on Fri and Sat. So got there around 10:30 on a friday morning. Line wasn't to long. I'm assuming the person at the front was Doug, whomever he was, He was very friendly and proffessional. Most places, once they are featured on a tv show they appear nice on the show, but when you end up going there, they are usually rude. Not the case here. I ate a selma hyack and boy was she hot. The duck fat fries....couldnt tell the difference between them and regular fries. Oh well, I came for the novelty. Now I can check this off my list of places I've eaten at."
1793,"Hands-down the best hot dog I've ever had. My friends and I ordered so much that I think we scared the old lady who sat next to us, but her loss! It was all delicious. The polish was fantastic, but the special dogs really rocked my world: Cognac and hazelnut pheasant sausage with black currant sauce, chicken pate and truffle-balsamic cream. To die for. Duck sausage with truffle aioli and foie gras. Delectable. Also, spring for the duck fat fries. A quote from Doug: ""Eat anything fried in duck fat, even if it's a shoe."" Amen! The wait, well, it was really long - about 1 1/2 hours (we got there at 12:45) And it was cold. But if you're game, go for it. The food is fantastic!"
1794,"So, my brother and his home girl bring some Hot Doug's back to the house. 4 different dogs (Foie Gras, The Dog, Elk, Spicy Jamaican Jerk) and our home girl got a corn dog (lol). They also brought home the duck fat fries. They waited in the line for 2 hours and they brought this home? $40 tab? The hype killed my experience probably. I expected a lot more. The over hyped fries tasted like Suzy's fries (for all who know Suzie's the-Grease-Pit on Elston, knows this is not a good thing). The best dog out of the bunch we ordered was The Dog, regular Chicago style hotdog. Would I go again, maybe. Maybe, I have to eat it fresh - but for now - I think Maxwell Street still has my dog of choice - and I can buy 6 pairs of socks from the street ""vendors"" during my visit to Maxwell. My brother liked it and he's a tough food critic, so maybe I am missing something..."
1795,"What else to say that hasn't already been said after 1,200+ reviews? Just go. That said, it's good to go strategically. Go hungry. Go in mid-afternoon to avoid super-long lines. Go when you have company in town -- even if you have to wait, the experience still delivers. Go when it's nice out so you can sit on the little patio tucked away on the side of the building. The Celebrity Sausage star of the day was outta this world, with a cherry and apple pork sausage, sweet curry mustard, cocoa Cardona cheese and vodka-infused dried fruits. One large order of fries was enough for four people. Oh, and Doug takes the A La Card, and while it seems like a challenge to spend $25 here, we were able to get just over the limit and thus received a generous discount. What a special treat."
1796,"Excellent Hot ""Doug's""!!! Waited for an hour in the cold to try the hot dogs...they are simply amazing!"
1797,"What else is there to say about Hot Doug's other than SO GOOD?! I don't eat meat, so I always just get two veggie corn dogs,(mostly because I have no idea what to get on the veggie dog and don't want to hold up the line or accidentally order ketchup and be frowned upon by everyone in Chicago), a drink, and sometimes I'll share some fries if I'm there with a friend. It's always SO good, and their soda's always seem to taste better than anywhere else. I wish I had one of the corn dogs right now, actually. I've come when the line was around the corner and completely down the block in 30 degree weather (Always worth the wait!), to three people in line ahead of me. So it's sort of a gamble, but even when it is busy, the line goes fast, and the employees do a good job making sure people don't steal tables without getting their food first! I just wish it was closer/easier to get to, and had wider hours, but it doesn't even matter, It's so good. Definitely check out Hot Doug's if you haven't yet, just make sure to check the website first to make sure they are randomly taking a day/week off for something!"
1798,"I feel silly writing a review for Hot Doug's - because everyone knows how amazing it is and those who don't live in another state. But regardless, it's always a treat to come here. I've only had the pleasure to go on weekdays, when I've been off work for whatever reason. One attempt to go on the weekend resulted in a quick drive-by, after seeing the line wrapped around the building and the temp being around -19. Doug is incredibly friendly. The staff is incredibly friendly. The food is heaven, pure tasty heaven. I always make sure to get a special or the game of the week (ever eat rattlesnake?). I was going to give 4 stars, only because the hours are so short and the space is so small, but I can't imagine a Hot Doug's open later than 4:30PM or a second location. It's all just a part of the HD charm."
1799,"Pure meat & intestinal casing heaven. This is the best hot dog/sausage place I've ever been to. The Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Truffle Sauce Moutarde, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris is a fantastically decadent experience. I don't think there's anything I can say about this that would be more illuminating than the name. The Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Pepper Affinois Cheese was my favorite. It all works together amazingly. The BLT was the only miss. It's a sausage made with bacon, with lettuce and tomato toppings. I just couldn't resist the idea of bacon on the inside of the sausage. This may be the only time I've ever had bacon that wasn't awesome. Somehow it just comes out as a dry, and only slightly bacon flavored. The duck fat fries just taste like good fries. I couldn't taste any trace of duck fat at all. For those who know their California hot dog places, this is like the best part of LA's Pink's, tons of tasty toppings (which make up for a mediocre dog), with the best part of Berkeley's Top Dog, an awesome dog (though maybe Hot Doug's dogs are even better)."
1800,"Don't mess around with Chicago dogs or their cutesy celebrity dogs here, aim straight for Today's Specials or the Game of the Week. It's a good thing there's a line, else I would never have time to weigh the relative benefits of eating elk sausage with forest berry mustard vs. smoked chorizo in a tomatillo mole. Gives you time to pull yourself together. The duck fries are overrated."
1801,"The GOOD: The food is amazingly good. Each polish has a combo that makes my taste buds yearn for more. To quote Ken Griffey Jr. from the softball episode in ""The Simpsons,"" ""Wow. It's like there's a party in my mouth, and everyone's invited."" Each dog is an experience everyone has to try for themselves. I usually go there with 4-5 friends and we just go split them in half and share. I really can't explain how delicious the sausages are. Just try it and you will be hooked. The BAD: The seating. It's such a small place, but decorated in a playful, unique way with walls covered in hot dogs and hot dog memorabilia. Some people know the drill by eating at a good pace and leaving. Some of the people, however, love to just make a day out of sitting at their table. It's straight up terrible how some people can be so inconsiderate of the people waiting in line. Some people have been outside for like 45min to 1 hour+! The duck fat fries are average. A lot of people rave about them, but I like my fries to be thicker but that's just me. It does give a slightly sweeter taste that can appeal to some people, but I'm not really into that either. The UGLY: The wait! The wait can be seriously long and ugly. The last visit we had there gave my friends and I an hour wait. It was during the winter, but the day wasn't too bad for everyone except for my brother's friend (he came with just a long sleeve T-shirt and sweatpants over basketball shorts. He ended up using his pants to cover his arms because the windchill was making him pretty cold up top. Another ugly thing is the prices. $7.50-$9.50 for a hot dog? Good Lord that's alotta money. Costco has some of the same mixtures in like 12-15 packs for $14. I actually wanted to make this a 3 star place but the hot dogs were just too good. Well the dogs are great but the only real problems are seating, the wait, and prices. If your willing to go through those obstacles then you have an awesome hot dog in your future."
1802,"Definitely an experience... everything from standing in line for an hour, to trying to choose a hot dog, to talking with doug, to eating in their interestingly decorated space. I got the Spicy Italian Sausage, which was one of the specials. it had pesto, roma tomatoes, and feta on it. It was very tasty and a good size. Big enough but not huge. My husband ordered fries (not the duck fat ones) and they were ok, but not as good as I thought they would be. The melted American cheese on the top actually grossed me out a little. Doug, the owner was super, super friendly, though. Even though the line was out the door he genuinely seemed to care about each and every customer and didn't push us through the line. I was also surprised about the amount of seating their was. You would think that a place with 1+ hour lines would have no room to sit, but it wasn't the case. I'll definitely be back with my guy to sample some other dogs!"
1803,"I feel like Yelp'ing Hot Dougs is like a right of passage for both Chicago and Yelp. What could be bad about a Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium. My rule with Hot Dougs is that you MUST try something you would not normally eat. You can get a Chicago Dog (as I did), but you BETTER couple that with something more interesting. How many places can you get a duck, rattlesnake, bison, boar, or whatever animal you are craving? I wont say anything new either, but here goes about my experience... I got there around 10:30am, not because I was scared of a wait, but I was awake and decided to go instead of going back to sleep. I am glad I went when I did - there were already like 75 people in line! At 10:30am! GO TO BED PEOPLE. I go the Chicago dog (I judge a place by their Chicago dog so I had to go simple for one) and I also got the duck sausage with orange marmalade and blue cheese. The Chicago dog was great! Grilled to perfection with everything you want. The duck sausage was tasty as well, although the blue cheese was quite strong. I wish it were toned down a little, but I know that is just means it was good cheese, which I respect. I wanted to try the duckfat fries but I was alone and couldnt bring myself to do it. I did try the regular fries and they were good! You got a ton so enough for sharing. Get there early, prepare for an experience, try something you wouldnt normally eat, and be willing to spend a little money and go all out. Hot Dougs was also featured on Anthony Bourdains ""13 Places to Eat Before You Die"" ..it was on a list with some VERY high-end restaurants. It was quite the honor. A few other points - -There is street parking (at least on weekends) -The menu online is very accurate and they update it everyday with the specials -Dont ask ""what do you recommend"" ...Apparently everything is good! -Very good customer service!"
1804,"I don't care if everyone thinks this place is ""overrated""... what matters is my opinion and I think it is good! I had an awesome dog there... I forget what it was called, but it had beans and chipotle mayo on it. Really dude... my mouth is watering thinking about that delicious wiener going into my mouth. GO ON FRIDAY AND GET DUCK FAT FRIES... IF YOU HAVE NO CONCERN OVER YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR INEVITABLE HEART ATTACK THESE FRIES ARE FOR YOU! So fattening and SO yummy... Me gusta mucho mucho. Really... go here. It will be busy and you may have to wait but it will be worth it. Take Manders' word for it!"
1805,"At the time of review Hot Doug's has 1034 user generated ratings and similar number of quality comments. There's absolutely nothing new I can add, but I had to give these guys my 5-stars. Why: 1. Doug spent about 5 minutes chatting with us despite a line about one neighborhood block long (which didn't take terribly long). 2. Very cheap, quality meal. The only 'high price' item is the duck sausage - but that has foie gras and truffles. That's a deal. 3. Duck fat fries - enough said. 4. Duck fat fries - where else are you going to get these Seriously, no hyperbole, tastiest meal I've had in Chicago. Doug is an inspiration for anyone who hates their day job, because it's very apparent that he doesn't."
1806,"While I was in line, it was hard to reconcile the almost 2-hour wait for a hot dog. Once inside, I got it. The Chicago char dog was easily the best I've had, but not *that* much better than the other places. The real winner was the foie gras dog -- so covered in fatty amazingness I could only eat a few bites. I braved the long Saturday lines so I could try the duck-fat fries, and while they were delicious, I bet the regular weekday fries are just as good. What really surprised me was the relaxed attitude of the staff. For a place that operates on volume, I never felt rushed in my ordering or eating. Hot Doug's really is the premier dog hut in Chicago."
1807,"Amazing Dogs! Vesuvial, and satisfying garlic belches all the way home had me leaning my head out the window to avoid asphixiating the other passengers...and I loved every gaseous bit of it. These guys do great stuff. On a trip to Chicago that featured a few ell-known, downtown fine dining establishments, Doug's was the culinary standout of our visit. The garlic pork sausage with horseradish and cheese, and the traditoinal Chicago dog, duck fries, and a neon green soda of some sort made for a most memorable lunch. This will become a regular stop on our visits to Chicago, and in spite of pleadings to the contrary, I will continue to consume the garlic-pork concoction."
1808,"I've been here. Yes, it is ""that good."" I won't waste your time... :)"
1809,"How can you fault the place? The motto on the back of the T-shirts: ""There are no two finer words in the english language than encased meats, my friend"" That pretty much says it all. Doug is serious about his sausages and sausage kitch. The place is decorated in preposterous primary colors and the air is filled with Violent Femmes era catchy post-punk. Often there will no free tables and a line out the door, but Doug gets people in and out as fast as he might, never hurrying anyone off the tables or counterspace. They offer a range of traditional sausages at amazingly reasonable prices($1.50 dogs?!?! Seriously.), and they also offer specialty sausages, like the celeb of the week for between $5 and $10. Nice. To have these exotic combinations, like Thai chicken dog, or a tequila chicken sausage with diablo mustard and salsa is a treat for someone like me who wouldn't eat hot dogs otherwise. The duck fat fries are excpetional and decadent...I think my heart stopped for a second mid-consumption, but oh so worth it. And if you're a little more skittish, the regular fries are fresh cut and of quality, so if you're there on weekdays, it's no great loss. Plus, they've got Green River in the can. Pure Chicago. http://www.bevnet.com/re Doug strikes me as a compressed and tightly wound man, but he never inflcits it on the customers, except in his finicky affinity to serve the hell out of them. He's friendly and decent, and even the most complex order is up under 10 minutes. Whether you're a lifelong chicagoan looking for a chicago style-dog, or a gourmand looking for a new experience, the place afor you is Hot Doug's, THE sausage superstore."
1810,"What a great little place. Stupidly I decided to make my maiden voyage to Hot Dougs when it was 8 degrees outside. I thought, ""Hey, maybe people won't be standing in line on such a miserable day."" I was wrong. We arrived to a line about 10 deep outside, and about 20 more crammed in the breezeways. Anyhow, after about 30 minutes we made it to the counter. I order a smoked cajun pork sausage topped with a cheese and it was incredible. Great texture, great taste. The duck fat fries were a perfect compliment. Don't let the line scare you off. The comraderie in the line is part of the experience. Truly 1 of a kind. edit 7/11 I just wanted to re-iterate that Doug's attitude is the icing on the cake. Always happy to answer questions and make suggestions."
1811,"Ummm. Besides watching cooking/traveling shows on tv, this is pretty much where I've gotten my culinary education. Seriously, where else can you get creme fresh or truffles on a sausage? Doug works the register, which totally rules. Unfortunately, some people think they are beyond his genius, and try to change his specialty dogs and ask lots of ridiculous questions once they finally get to the front of the line... hence the 30-minute wait. Visiting this restaurant in January is not for the faint of heart, but that doesn't stop me from going there every Saturday. Make sure to check the website before you go, though... Doug likes his vacations and takes them at random."
1812,"Man I love Doug and his delicious sausages... No matter how many times I come and how long I wait it is still a pleasure. With a keen taste on flavor combinations and an obviously adventurous spirit Doug can do no wrong (although some of his specials aren't ALWAYS on.) As if the food wasn't enough, constantly reading stories about how cool Doug is and how he has such a following makes it a pleasure to give up my cash to him. see this thread on lth for more: http://lthforum.com/bb/v"
1813,"The best encased meats that I have ever eaten. Not too salty and never bland. So why only 4 stars? 2 reasons: 1) The duck fries were just plain greasy. I love potatoes so if I don't finish off the fries first something is definitely wrong. 2) Lack of info about the casings. Seriously, how hard is it to list whether or not the beef, chicken, and veggie sausages are encased in a pork skin/casing. The fact that this info is not listed (despite the requests for this info) makes me suspect that everything, pork or not, is encased in pork."
1814,"Hot Doug's is one of those places that makes me really happy to live in Chicago. Everything about it is spectacular. Doug always has a smile on his face, the music is swell, and of course the food is terrific. Every time I come in, I feel the need to order much more than I would normally eat at any other time. The most recent standout was the game of the week - White Wine and Dijon Rabbit Sausage with Dijon-Garlic Goat's Milk Butter, Montboissi Cheese and Balsamic-Truffle Cream. Outstanding. Also decided to finally try ""The Dog"" - Doug's version of the regular Chicago dog. Pretty freaking good I must say. Grilled onions instead of the usual raw. I can't see me waiting in line just for this, but it certainly is a nice way to round out a lunch of some of the more creative menu entries. Superb."
1815,"5 stars b/c at 10:45 AM on a Wednesday - waited 15 min. Yay :) Went with a large group so got to try multiple dogs (double yay!) 4 stars b/c the food was just ok. Boo :( My fave was the uber garlic pork sausage. It was bursting with flavor but not so overwhelming with the garlic. We also tried the ribeye: after the uber garlic, this was slightly bland until i spread the crispy onion and horseradish sauce evenly on the dog. The andouille sausage had a mild seasoning: pretty good...like a more seasoned hot dog. The firedog tasted like a hot dog with a dash of spices in it. The foie gras and duck sausage was too gamey for me - but I guess that's no fair to the sausage b/c I'm not too into foie gras The atomic dog was spicier than the firedog. I felt that the habenero jack cheese didn't pair well with the sausage. I don't know how else to describe these dogs b/c there was nothing that truly stood out to me but they were still good enough to enjoy eating. Like I've said before, I'd NEVER wait more than 30 min to eat here. At least the staff is nice :)"
1816,What needs to be said about Hot Doug's? It is everything that you've heard; it's everything that you think it might be. Anthony Bourdain is absolutely right - Hot Doug's is one of the 13 places you have to eat before you die: http://www.menshealth.co I've been going to Hot Doug's for the past couple years. I try and go once a month. Check the website - it's a great resource. The flavors are amazing - the decor is amazing - and Doug's personality manning the cash register every Saturday morning makes this place a MUST GO if you are in Chicago.
1817,"Great stuff ... I was this place on travel channel on a couple of their shows .... So good! I enjoyed it a lot. The best part is the unique game hotdogs, these are hotdogs you probably won't find anywhere else, everything from kangaroo to rattlesnake hotdogs. I myself had the kangaroo, when i was there, and boy was it worth the wait. Doug, himself, was there and greated me with a warm welcome, just like he did on the tv! TRY THE FRIES!!!!! So if you are in the mood for something out of the ordinary, DEFINATELY GO HERE!!!"
1818,"Having heard so many things about duck fat fries, I felt that it'd be inappropriate to skip out on these ""life changing"" (according to Anthony Bourdain, I believe) fries on my visit to Chicago over the July 4th weekend. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I finally made it into the store and ordered two special dogs (the catalonian and the foie) and of course duck fat fries (they only have these on the weekends). Before I get to the good things, I've got to say that the duck fat fries were *very* disappointing. I'm not sure if it was a long day and we were just unfortunate enough to get stuck with fries from old fryer oil or what... But the fries were disappointing even if they were not fried in duck fat. Lacking flavor and a little bit on the soggy side, I probably wouldn't order these again. The Foie dog with the duck sausage was interesting. Hot Doug's definitely did not skimp on the amount of foie on the dog. I'd suggest eating this last as the foie can overwhelm your palate and have a tendency to stay in your mouth a little longer than you'd think. My favorite, by far, was the catalonian... Pork sausage with a saffron rouille... That combo was heavenly... Not only can you actually see threads of saffron in the rouille, it tasted sooooo good... I can probably eat the rouille by itself... If you don't want to wait in line for a loooong time, you really should come early..."
1819,"I've gone to hot dog heaven! Never have I thought hot dog could actually be a gourmet meal...but that's until I came to Hot Doug's. After waiting for 2 hours in the blistering cold (yes, it was worth it), we ordered everything that sounded good! And the names of the hot dog creations were hilarious. { WHAT TO ORDER } * Chicago hot dog - you're in Chicago, you just have to at least try it! * Corndog - yes, it's good!! * Every darn thing on their special menu: ** Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage (OH SO YUMMY!!!) ** Ribeye Steak Sausage * French fries cooked in duck fat - this is certainly overrated (served only on Fridays and Saturdays) but it's worth a try { ENVIRONMENT } This place is really small!! Order and pay first before you sit down at a table. { TIP } * CASH ONLY * Come when they first open (10:30). After 11ish, you are screwed! Check their website for operating hours. Sometimes Doug takes a day off and closes the restaurant. So call in advanced before coming here. * DO NOT SIT before you order or else you will get yelled by Doug (yep, I got yelled at ): ). This place certainly lived up to its hype. I will definitely visit this place again next time I'm in Chicago!! It's that delicious! *drooling*"
1820,"I really feel it's 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to be nice. Bottom line: it didn't live up to the hype for me. I had the duck fat fries. Surprisingly they tasted ""cleaner"" and less greasy than regular fries. Overall, however, they did not impress me. As for encased meat, I had The Keira Knightley fire dog. It was not spicy, and seemed like a regular ol' dog. Then I had the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds. Definitely different, and pretty good, but my sister's antelope was better. I do give the place props for its creativity. I would go back to try the alligator sausage, but I would not go out of my way for the duck fat festivities. Don't be too intimidated by the line. It only took us 45 minutes to get to a table on a Friday."
1821,"My husband and I have tried to go four times, and for one reason or another it hasn't worked out. We finally made it when I took a Friday off work for my birthday. Expect a long line- as long as it was on a cold Friday, I can't imagine how long the wait must be on a warm Saturday. That said, a long wait won't deter me from going back, yum! Seeing as we were celebrating my birthday had no qualms about ordering the decadent Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. And the duck fat fries. And a corn dog. And a celery soda! Everything was amazing, definitely worth the (thousands of) calories!"
1822,"My sister had been going on and on about this place. So when I arrived in Chicago we made a point of swinging by and grabbing a couple of dogs and some fries. I only eat hot dogs in Chicago and these were as good as any I have had. I love the different combinations. However the highlight was the duck fat fries. They were almost good enough to tempt me into moving back to Chicago (almost). If in town or just in the neighborhood, swing by. You can't beat the price and they won't disappoint."
1823,Yes Yes Yes Yeasssss! The Original Dog is my jam- although I've always enjoyed the exotic ones.
1824,"I love Hot Doug's. A friend turned me onto the place and I'm grateful to her for that. Great tasting, inventive dogs. Fun, chill atmosphere. AIl of this is offered at a pricepoint that pretty much anyone can live with. I took my dad and his wife there and they loved it too. I wish it kept more convenient hours. I also wish the location were a little more accomodating. However, in the grand scheme of things, it's a small price to pay for something that is cool like Hot Doug's."
1825,"When my friend told me she had a *gourmet* hot dog place for me to try I kinda thought it was a big joke and was wondering where the punch line was... This was until I had the greatness that is a hot dougs hot dog! I sampled the prime rib with duck fat fries. Let me just tell you that this place was an experience everyone should try. It can be a little intimidating if you aren't ""in the know"" (the no sitting before you are served rule, long line and limited hours are a bit of a detractor) but believe me, it is well worth the trouble."
1826,"It just doesn't get better than this as far as hot dog/fries type places go. Sure you'll probably have to wait in line and rush to get there before it closes mid day, but it is all worth it. Oh, and much like others have said, Doug is a really nice guy. Just be sure to check if he's on vacation/open before you make the trek over there. Doug has to be feeling pretty good about all the free publicity he got from the Foie gras scandal. The ticket was well worth it, I'm sure."
1827,"Hot Doug's is the shiz. He makes a superior corn dog. I know, I know- corn dogs are awesome, but they're pretty uniformally awesome in that they are a hot dog and deep fried and on a stick. But somehow, I don't know how, he makes a corn dog that puts all others to shame. Super clean, super awesome, and super friendly and polite waitstaff."
1828,"I've lived in Roscoe Village for three years now and have always avoided this place. Didn't want to go in fear of a let down. So on a blizzardry not going to work day, the wife and I decided to head to Hot Doug's.... I mean, there's 5 inches on the ground and snows still coming down, no one would be at Hot Doug's right?? 20 minutes wait out in the blizzard and then 10 minutes more inside later.... I didn't really mind the wait... It's kind of like an initiation ritual, everyone has to do it, no VIP treatment here..... You wait outside staring in as watching people shove handfuls of fries and dogs down their gullet.... I was practically drooling by the time we got to the counter. It was worth it. There was a slight fear in me when I placed the order. I had a mental picture of the soup nazi at the counter... any slight movement and I would be sent out the door empty handed. But it was quite opposite. Doug was great, easy to converse with. I ordered one specialty dog and the spicy hot dog. The wife had a specialty and we split an order of the duck fat fries. They also had great sodas in there fridge, I got the orange creme, the wife got the Berghoff root beer. There were plenty of seats inside. We came out of there smelling like encased meat and the line somehow was even longer."
1829,"Hot Doug's is: -The only restaurant I'll stand in line for, except when I'm at sporting events or amusement parks -The only restaurant I'll spend $24 on hot dogs, fries and a drink -The only restaurant that serves things like cherry pork sausage and apple salsa with fancy French cheese -The only restaurant I'd eat two hotdogs AND duck fat fries and not feel TOO guilty about it -The only restaurant that seems like it's too crowded to find a seat, but works like a machine, turning over tables -The only restaurant I've ever had my order taken from the owner himself -The only restaurant I'd go to when its doors open"
1830,"Yum. Yum yum yum yum. I have to say I wasn't sure what to expect. I grew up with a Granfather who used to make all kinds of sausages and other encased meats. No one's could be as good as Grandpa's. Hot Doug's, you have proved me wrong. I was a little leary of all the gourmet offerings but I went for it. Even added an order of duck fat fries to the meal. I ordered the Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Pomegranate Creme Fraiche and Goat Cheese. Fantastic. The meat was a little spicy and the cheese and creme fraiche were a great accompaniment. My friend E ordered the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Cream Sauce and Smoked Almonds. A hot dog with a cream sauce?! Delicious. The flavors of the sauce and meat were perfectly paired. My other friend, J, ordered Spicy Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango Dijonnaise, Roasted Plantains and Crescenza Cheese. Wow. That mango sauce...wow. And plantains!! *drool* We also ordered a corn dog as dessert. 'eh, it's a corn dog. You really can't screw up a corn dog. I didn't really taste the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries. I'd opt not to try those again. One thing to note, tho....no mustard on the table. Only ketchup, salt & pepper. This is Chicago, people, and we need our mustard. At least I do. Even if it's just for the fries. All in all, this was a fantastic meal and I will be going back. I do want to try their Chicago dog. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know a lot of people wouldn't waste the money, but I'm a huge fan of a vienna red hot once through the garden."
1831,"While visiting Chicago, my friends decided I must try Hot Doug's. As we drove by looking for a parking spot, I was shocked to see that there was a LINE OUT THE DOOR. And it was RAINING, so everyone is huddled together with their umbrellas, waiting in the line that snaked around the corner. I thought, ""WTF. This is just a hotdog place. It can't be THAT good."" I was wrong. I thought that Costco's $1.50 hotdogs were heaven. Costco, I'm sorry. You just got crushed. We ordered the Elk and cheese hotdog, the Cajun Spicy Pork, and the Pheasant... all with specialty cheeses on them. And, of course, the duck fat fries. Trans fats? What trans fats!??! Really, it was the best hotdog I have ever eaten. The juicy, greasy meat, the blue cheese piled on, the rich, flavorful fries. And Doug, who took our order, was so nice and friendly. But, I really couldn't help but think of the fat that was slowly clogging my arteries, and that's what kept my 4 stars from being 5."
1832,"Okay, I'm sorry. I don't like giving bad reviews, but this place was wayyyyyy over-rated. Or maybe my experience was just horrible... My friend and I were visiting the great city of Chicago and of course we had to try the famous Chicago style hot dog. And of course we had to go to Hot Doug's. So we literally took public transit for 30 minutes and walked another 20 minutes JUST to get there. (Okay, it took us 20 minutes to walk because my friend hurt her knee and I hurt my foot. Some random and unfortunate thing happened to us and we ended up limping wherever we traveled to in Chicago.) That's not the reason for the bad review. So we get there, we wait in line, and we order the first one (Chicago style) with everything on it. We try ordering the duck fat fries but alas, it's Saturday and no duck fat fries. Remember!! Go on a Thursday, you should confirm, but I think it's the day when they make the duck fat fries. Also!! They close at 4:00 pm! At least on the day we went, so we were literally rushing our way over (at 3:30) when a local told us that. The hot dog was an ordinary hot dog. I mean, I don't know, it didn't taste spectacular, and it was kind of small. I guess the price was decent, but I guess coming from LA we have those hot dog carts with a similar price but the hot dogs are bigger and tastier. That is why I took off 2 stars. For all the effort we put forth to go to this famous place, the food was just okay and the service wasn't even that nice. One star I took off was because I didn't feel like the owner was really all that friendly. Also, (and maybe you'll think this part for the star is unfair) I left my camera there in which I frantically called back the following day over and over because I had a flight to catch back home. The owner really didn't give a crap about my dismay and wasn't even willing to take my information down should they find the camera. All and all, I guess it's a cool place to visit in Chicago. But don't have high expectations like we did.. I really didn't feel like it was worth all the wait."
1833,"Don't mess with the power of Mr. Encased Meat. This guy is the ""Sausage King"" of the Chicago hot douggy world, all hail da King. Try to copy and fellow yelpers will shot you down, fRed Hot and Fries. Then again, what about the Chicago Dog House? This place is mostly filled with sausage wannabees who couldn't tell a Vienna beef from an Oscar Mayer and for certain, a Thuringer from a Polish. How many of these sausage wannabees wouldn't even notice if they had ketchup on their encased? How many of those would actually prefer it? What's so wrong, why such a big deal about using ketchup? Then you have the enlightened that can truly appreciated this place. It doesn't take much to be enlightened, probably saying that you have a favorite stand growing up. Chicago has so many places and Sohnny undeniable shines. No need to rehash the menu, plenty of others are glad to regurgitate it. The lines, the street parking, I wouldn't make it a daily or monthly place. I simply don't have intense cravings for a so called gourmet sausage, just a Maxwell St. Polish will comfort me just fine. Yep, plenty of those places without having to wait and provide parking."
1834,"Going to Hot Doug's is like going to the amusement park; you wait in line for a really long time, but in the end it was all worth it. Like all the reviews, the line is super long. The food however is AMAZING and makes up for the long wait. The regular polish sausages and hot dogs are great, but definitely try their specialty dogs. The duck fries on Friday and Saturday are not to miss either. ;) Tip - Go here right when they open to avoid ridiculously long lines and going on weekdays also help. If the weekend is the only time you can venture out to Hot Dougs', then eat a snack before you go! Tip 2 - They take cash only, so make sure you have some on you!"
1835,"Pretty God-danged good. I cannot say that in any other day of my life have I eaten 4 and a half hot dogs and/or sausages. Selma Hayek - grilled, a little too charred for my taste, but yummy - 3 stars Mandarin chicken sausage with siracha mustard - sweet and tangy, mixed with heat - 4 stars Hot Doug - Chicago style greatness - 5 stars Foie gras dog - next time, i'm having it steamed and with no sea salt, but 5 stars Lamb and cognac dog with peppercorn cheese - really really cheesy! had to brush some off, but great sauce! 5 stars. ....I cant wait to go back and try the rest!"
1836,"The most kick ass encased meats you can get in chicago. They have a menu that changes on and off, so theres always something interesting and new to try. the wait can get kind of annoying, but try it right around the time they open and you probably won't wait long....as a hot dog aficionado this is one of my fav' joints."
1837,"If you've never been, you need to eat here once. This is not just a ""hot dog place"" like I've heard many tell me they think it is. Take a chance, and order something unique that you may not eat otherwise as well. Do what I did, bring some friends, each pick a different dog, and then cut them up share the encased gourmet goodness that is Hot Dougs. Beware you'll need to expect to be in line for at least two hours on a weekend. But this has never been hard as everyone in line is super friendly in my experience."
1838,"Dearest Doug, You have some of the best hot dogs and sausages in town, but waiting 2 hours for a hot dog is insane. On the plus side, when I want to eat at your restaurant and see the block long line, my rage forces me to keep driving/riding onward and try some place new. So I am writing you to request that you open 3 other restaurants on the other 3 corners, so that the crowds can be handled in a timely fashion. I have always wondered if you would frown upon me getting my order to go and selling it to the highest bidder outside? Thank you for your time, Concerned Sausage Lover"
1839,"I had never heard of this place until Monday when I went for the first time. We got there around 2pm and had to wait about 45 minutes to get in. If the weather wasn't so cold and windy, I probably would not complain, but damn was it cold! When you get in, they have their regular menu and then their specialty meats. The regulars are in the $3 range and the specialties are about $8. I ordered the Sante Fe Chicken (Dave Kingmon) and it was delicious! Then I got the Wild Boar with pesto sauce and that was also ridiculously good. Everyone said to try the fries and I did, but did not think they were anything special. This is a great place to try, but I would dress for cold or wait for the weather to improve."
1840,"Caught a show, possibly DD&D that featured hot doug's and living easily 30mins from this place it took the better part of a year to finally get here. They close at 4pm and it seemed as though each time I thought ""oh a hot dog sounds good I should try out that doug's place"" - my luck I had these thoughts somewhere between 345-415pm! Fast forward about a year and now I live 5mins from HD! Hot dog heaven - yes Doug is dishing out gourmet yum-yum on a bun. They are creative and of the highest quality. I came on a random Tuesday and was able to sit down and enjoy a spicy italian something and some tasty fries. Silly me being a newbie I came back on a Saturday, and there was a long line out the door. I made the rest of my party wait over an hour promising hot dog ecstasy and Doug didn't make a liar out of me."
1841,"Most definitely, as good as a hot dog gets. First of all, it's awesome that Doug himself takes your order and talks to you. As friendly as a man could be, Doug is a generous and amiable guy. He in himself makes this place 5 stars. Now for the hot dogs. They are good. Like, really good. You might not 'love' each one you try, as each has such exceptionally strong and different flavors. But they will be like nothing you've ever had before, I can gurantee it. And I think every customer hits on one special that is amazing to them. So go forth, enjoy these wonderful gourmet delicacies. They will not disappoint (not even if there's a two hour wait, you'll only enjoy it more)."
1842,"We came, we waited, we ate. The specialty dogs are phenomenal. Would be back for those in a heartbeat. Just don't order a plain dog (in addition to your specialty dog) thinking it will be as spectacular. Blaaaaaaand. Stick to Superdawg for your 'plain' Chicago hotdog needs."
1843,"Way back when, Hot Dougs was one of my first finds on yelp. Back before the fire. Back before the new location. Back before all the people in line. Oh wait...there has always been a line... These puppies are worth waiting for though. Who would have thought you could get so creative with encased meats? Doug. You gotta love Doug! It's hard to decide what to try so you will be obligated to come back, stand in that line and try more. Do not forget a side of fries."
1844,"Bacon sausage? BACON SAUSAGE!?!?! Congrats...you just uped your game from crack to heroin. Jesus, Doug, is there nothing you can't do?"
1845,"Hot Doug's is the only place that I will get a hot dog in Chicago! Nothing else compares! I will only stop by on Friday afternoons too, because it's not THAT long of a wait (45 min) and the duck fat fries are definitely my top favorite fries of all time. Anytime someone comes to visit me, I make sure I bring them here!"
1846,"Another place that doesn't need any further description. Just know that this place gets extremely busy (as in line out the door busy), it's open only from 10:30 am to 4:00 pm, duck fat fries are Friday and Saturday only, and that they have a crazy selection of sausages/dogs. If you're a first timer, I suggest checking out their website to see the different type of dogs they have. My only suggestion is that you try one of their specialty dogs. It's worth it. Hell, get two dogs while you are at it. Oh and the duck fat fries are money, but it's even better with cheese. If you love hot dogs or are a foodie, then this is a must. Others might be put off by the wait and hype for ""just"" a hot dog. Oh and how many places still have the owner working the front? Doug is one classy, cool dude."
1847,"I had the foie Gras and sauternes sausage with foie gras mousse, truffle aioli, and fleur de sel - well executed and unique to say the least, but way too rich. 1 bite would have sufficed. I do not fault Mr. Doug and his establishment for this - I should have known what I was getting myself into. The duck fat fries, on the other hand, were absolutely divine and worth the 1 hr, 45 minute wait by themselves."
1848,"Well Doug, you lost 2 customers yesterday for life! My friend and I decided to head over there after talking about going for literally months. I have been there once(Great food) and she had never been there. We spent about 15min drooling over the menu online. We got there, no line, parking right on the side.......Starting to get real excited about stuffing my face with Game Sausage, we walk in @ 4:02pm and there is a girl standing right there like a nightclub bouncer that tells us, WE'RE CLOSED! Seriously??? People drive out of their way to come there & wait in line to eat and you turn them away at 4:02? Thats some crappy business practice. Doug, I hope you told her to turn people away at exactly 4pm, if not you should fire her. Plenty of other places to go in Chicago without the wait......... http://www.chicagosdog.c http://www.franksndawgs. I don't think your place is good enough to run it like a posh Chicago Nightclub. A business man you are NOT. People wait in line for hours?!?! Seriously? Get a life. Its a Hot Dog. haha"
1849,"You have to give it to Doug (The proprietor of this Popsicle stand) to come up with such a fresh twist to encased variations of snouts, lips, and a**holes. Ive been to quite a few hot dog stands in my time but not one where I had to wait 1 1/2 hours just to get one of these encased concoctions. I tell you what though the time spent in line is well worth it! The location is a little off but the main draw is the food! On the weekends they have duck fat French fries which are pretty good but I have to tell the truth....the first time I had them i was a little disappointed. I thought they would have more of an essence of duck instead of tasting super rich but still a goody. Their game of the week dogs change weekly so there is always something for the regulars to try. This place has to be on the regular to visit list if you are a Chicagoan!"
1850,"I don't do hot dogs much but I tell you what, the selection at Hot Doug's is really great for someone who needs something a little different. I would recommend it to anyone out to try something a bit different"
1851,"If there is a heaven, it would be just like Hot Doug's. Hot Doug's has taken the Chicago hot dog joint to soaring new heights. They do it by serving incredibly inventive, and unbelievably delicious, specialty sausages. Example: duck sausage with foie gras butter and morbier cheese. Drooling yet? Yeah, I thought so. Oh, but there's more. Their ""regular"" hot dogs are the best around. Their duck fat fries (served only on Friday and Saturday) have probably converted thousands of vegetarians. Throw cheese on those bad boys and you'll be spending the rest of the afternoon on the couch in a beautiful greasy coma. The only negatives are that it is barely open (lunchtime), is not exactly conveniently located, and is too popular for its own good. Lines on the weekends can be daunting. But don't be deterred. Grab a newspaper and wait. You'll thank me later."
1852,"Can't say enough about this place. Probably does not even need reviews but this is always delicious, always different and I love that Doug is always at the counter. If you have not been here, do so, get there early and try as many things as you can. Pheasant with Goji Berry was incredible Mountain Man is one of the best things I have had in a while. Hot Doug's Rules."
1853,"The first time I ate here, it was below twenty degrees outside. I'd been walking for what felt like forever in the snow and there was a line around the block. I got up to the counter where the owner, Doug himself, was taking the orders. He was friendly and charming. This day, I had my first ever Chicago-style hot dog, and an order of duck fat fries. And I vowed that it was worth the wait. I've been back a few times since then. The wait times vary, but I'm never disappointed. I haven't had many of the crazy sausages, but that's OK because I'm happy with the good ole Chicago-style dog."
1854,"One of the greatest sausage emporiums in Chi-City! Even though the sausages are not made at store-level, I give Doug Sohn major props for complimenting the flavors well with his condiments! My not much of an adventurer eater when it comes to meat, but my fiance is. He will try any and all game sausages! The lines are always ridiculously long, but totally worth the wait! If you're going on a Saturday, get there 30-45 minutes prior to when you're planning on eating."
1855,"If you're going to gripe about waiting in line, take your business elsewhere. Aside from whining, all you're accomplishing is getting between loyal regular customers (or soon-to-be regular customers) and a darn good hot dog. Doug is a master of meats (encased, to be exact), and he dresses up his gourmet dogs with everything from brie to homemade salsa to foie gras. And ever unpretentious, you can still get a regular hot dog, Chicago-style, with all the fixin's for $1.50. Here's a long-time regular's secret: come at 10:30 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. on weekdays if you're in a hurry. Otherwise, call ahead for carry out, because long-line wait times can run upwards of 30 minutes. Doug takes every order himself, amicably chatting with his customers new and old. Coming here is an experience, not a rushed lunch, so grab a spot in line, enjoy it, and don't miss the duck fat fries!"
1856,"Another yelper pointed out that maybe a 1 star rating was a little harsh and I'm updating my review. Btw, this place has a great veggie dog!"
1857,"Been here a zillion times. Doug's great. The Don Rickles and bacon sausage with avocado cream, lettuce, and tomatoes are both worth long drives and annoying lines. Go here at least once."
1858,"I'm a bit of a health nut, but even I didn't find the meats too greasy (of course, I didn't have the foie gras and duck sausage and duck fat fries. Another day...). I had the spicy mole chicken sausage + the keira knightly. AMAZING! I loved it!!!!!! My friend had the regular dog which was just as good. Will definitely be coming back. The outside seating could be a little more inviting, but eating inside was fine. It is clean and despite the line wrapped around the building, there were plenty of open tables."
1859,"Line=bad, Foi Gras Dog=Great, ""The Dog""= not bad, Doug taking your order= Good Overall a great place, very interesting if you have never been. Going back this weekend to get the duck fat fries!! Too much of a good thing= no way."
1860,"After seeing this on No Reservations and CBS Sunday Morning, I've been planning when I could take a Friday off of work to go here. And when I finally did, it was SO worth it. Location is challenging. You're in a partial CTA dead-zone but this place is really a testament to the fact that people DO indeed travel for good food. I went on a Friday at about 10:45 a.m. to make sure I would get the duck fat fries. Yes, I know it's early but there was already a line out the door and when I left around noon, it was insanely long but it moves pretty fast along. I had the duck fat fries, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris and one of the specials, Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions. Both were good and good size, but I preferred the fois gras. It wasn't too heavy and the duck sausage was actually very tasty. The Ribeye was good too but not my favorite. The duck fat fries were great. Really, nothing more to say there. I even got a Chicago dog to take home for my dad. Service is great, Doug takes your order, answers questions and helps you get the best tasting dog possible. I even got to put in my take-home order when I got my main food and it was ready and warm for me when left. I know there will always be a line, but I would definitely go back (early again too)."
1861,"-Oh my god! -Duck fat fries are only made on Fri and Sat. I personally ended up liking the regular ones better. My friend and I ordered 4 sausages are char-grilled as suggested by Doug who is super friendly and helpful. -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris....that is the most amazing sausage I have EVER tasted in my entire life. -Tequila and Black Bean Chicken Sausage with Mango Salsa and Asadero Cheese...fabulous. -Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds...actually tastes better as you get to the end of it than the start of it. I little too sweet for me at first. -Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Beer-Washed Truckle Cheese....I happen to love Elk so I was very happy. I will gladly wait in line for an hour AGAIN, anytime (well maybe not in the rain). Just bring a friend to chat with that you haven't talked to in a while and time will fly. Besides, I had nothing else to do and I'm from Florida. Disney has trained me well (and for much less of a reward than amazing sausage)."
1862,"There's literally nothing I can add to the mountains of praise heaped upon Hot Doug's, except that a recent special-- the White Wine Rabbit Sausage with Sauce Moutarde, Goat Cheese and Spicy Calabrese Peppers-- was absolutely (and amazingly) one of the best things I've ever eaten there. And I already considered this pretty much the best place in the world to eat. If you come here and just get a Chicago dog and give the place three stars, you're doing it wrong."
1863,"If you plan to go to Hot Doug's, be sure to be ready to wait at least an hour or so. I went on a Saturday morning before it opened and still had to wait 2 hours to be served. Its definitely worth the wait because once you get to that counter, you'll order like everything. I ended up spending around $30 for duck fat fries and 3 specialty hot dogs for two people. Definitely try to Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris and Spicy Beef Hot Link with Coca-Cola BBQ Sauce and Applewood-Smoked Cheddar Cheese."
1864,"Sorry, the wait just isn't worth it. It's great, just not worth a 2.5 hour wait. I followed the advice of a kind yelper, and went with a friend and we each bought 2 different dogs then cut them in half to try 4 different dogs. BLT hot dog -- the best thing I had, and rather underrated compared to it's fancier cousin (see below). Foie Gras hot dog -- fantastic Andouille hot dog -- ok, nothing to write home about Blueberry infused Venison w/ marscapone (sp?) cheese -- skip this. It's not ""infused"" with blueberry, if it's covered in blueberry sauce. I appreciate the adventurous idea -- it just doesn't work. Duck fat fries -- good, but honestly, not THAT special. They are only available on fri/sat -- check the web site. So if that's key, make sure you go then. If not -- the line may be a little more tolerable during the week, I'm not sure. Someone on here said s/he felt like it was a little overrated, so that people could justify waiting in line for so long, and I have to agree. I would say go early early early, go once, and get the BLT dog. Very very friendly guy and staff, but I just can't say I'd wait that long again. Note: It closes pretty early, and we thought we wouldn't make it, after waiting for 2 hours. As long as you are in line when the place closes, you'll get in -- they send an employee outside to stand in line and be the ""cutoff person""."
1865,"Wow. I mean... wow. I love Doug's. And I love Doug. This is such a great place to come for a truly Chicago experience. They serve the only veggie dog I've ever had that I think is worth eating. And of course, who doesn't want to try a nice rattlesnake or wild boar hot dog? Doug is always amiable and fun, the atmosphere is great, and the value is unbeatable. Some may be turned off by the wait, but I think given that the line is usually around the block, it tends to move pretty quickly."
1866,"I really like Hot Doug's. The wait wasn't too bad when we got there (I didn't time it.. maybe 20-25 minutes?) and the guy taking our orders (the owner?) was really nice and friendly. Plus! We barely had to wait for a table. A group behind us tried to swoop in on a group leaving a table, but one of the waitstaff told them that we were here first, and cleaned the table off for us. So nice! The food was out within five minutes and we gorged ourselves. We ordered seven hot dogs/sausages between the three of us and shared an order of duck fat fries. Holy moly. The sausages were delicious, and the fries were amazing! I would only recommend that you don't order your sausage with ""everything"" on it... I was too ambitious and could barely finish my food. Just stick to what you KNOW you like. Rock on, Hot Doug's."
1867,"I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but Hot Doug's is pretty amazing. I would recommend not going on a weekend unless you are in line when they open the doors. Our first attempt was foiled after waiting for an hour and only moving maybe 5 people deep in the line. We went back on a Monday morning before noon. I couldn't believe a line was already forming on a week day. After eating here, I can see why. Doug is really great about explaining what extras should put on your hot dog selection to guarantee an explosion in your mouth. While the Chicago style hot dog is an easy choice, don't neglect the specials board. Everything our table ordered was delicious. For a hot dog joint, I was really impressed. I give four stars only because the wait was so insane the first time we went. And did I mention how cheap the food is? Three of us ate for less than $15. It was ridiculous."
1868,"Maybe I just have more basic needs when it comes to hot dogs. Don't get me wrong, I liked Hot Doug's but something is holding me back from giving a full-fledged recommendation. Long lines and wait times? Yes. Unique selection of meats and toppings? Yes. The yin and the yang. My question to any potential newbie: Is ANY hot dog worth an hour-plus wait?"
1869,"It really is as good as everyone says it is! My first time eating at hot dougs I considered getting out of line because I figured a $5 dog wouldn't be worth my time. I'm glad I waited it out, half and hour is a small price to pay for the most delicious encased meat available to man. Believe the hype, and try the duck fat fries!"
1870,"I love your dogs, but hate the line that forms outside (which means this place is good!) Best time to go is early during the week. I wish you had better hours of operation, but this only adds to your ""mystique"". Funky dogs, some foodies might not like the joint, but I think its great!"
1871,"5 Stars, says it all! You can't get a better hot dog anywhere. My favorite is the Hot, or Kiera Knightley, but I still need to try all the others, so far I couldn't imagine anything better! Go on a Friday or Saturday and get Duck Fat Fries. I'm moving soon and after being in Chi-town for almost a year, I have to say this is the one place I will miss the most. The line can be a little long, but it's worth it. I've seen people come out and tell everyone waiting that it's all it's hyped up to be, and it sure is. It doesn't get better!"
1872,"I heart Hot Doug (and Hot Doug's). You will too. Everything they say is true. With this yelp, there will be 1,199 reviews with what has got to be a record-breaking high average. Anthony Bourdain said it was one of the 13 places to eat before you die. (Duh) It's the word on the street. It's the encased meat that the foodies adore. All I have to add is a heartfelt thanks to Mr. Doug. He is one of the nicest people I've ever met. He takes the orders himself, and in the process, he, the rockstar, makes you feel like one as well. (Maybe someday, I'll come in and he'll be grouchy. Wouldn't matter - the guy is a gem.) I'm also deeply grateful for the use of Salma Hayeks, the specials with chvre, the classic dogs, and the fries. Also true: Get there early. Bring ice water for the wait in the summers. The prices are unbeatable. Decide to tip - add to the awesome karma of the place."
1873,"I loved our visit to Hot Doug's! Yes, there was a wait, but it went pretty quickly and there's so much to look at on the walls, the time passed pretty quickly. My sweetie and I tried three different dogs, ranging from a chicken sausage and cheese to a regular ole weiner. Everything was super delish, and they even threw in an extra dog for free. The service was cheerful and it seemed like they had good repore with their regulars, even though they were slammed. Definitely a must-visit if you're in Chicago!"
1874,"They make damn good dogs here. The chicago dog is crisp and the fixins are bright and appealing to they eye and the taste buds. The specialty dogs are very unique in taste and not like anything you would find anywhere else. Cheese fries are good too: it looks like nacho cheese sauce but it doesnt taste like nacho cheese. The line is long, but its worth the wait and when you get to ordering theres always a table that opens up for seating. Theres usually an ice cream truck too in the warmer months to spoil your apetite while youre waiting. The outside guard is a nice touch when Doug is on vacation."
1875,"The are the best dogs I've ever had! And I hate condiments. Hot dogs can't be hot dogs without condiments, so I reluctantly ate them. I am SO glad I did. The food was amazing! On top of that, the service was great. Not much was expected since it's a fast food place. I came with 4 of my friends which is a big group for a smaller place like this. The guy helped us out by finding a table for us and seating us. Way beyond his responsibilities. My friend pointed out a subtlety that really contributed to an enjoyable experience. The guy taking our order, who I assumed is also the owner, timed his taking orders with the flow of people eating and leaving. While the wait in line is long, once you order your food you'll get a table and be able to take your time eating without the pressure of other people standing around you waiting for your table. Plus, if you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse of the bus boy dancing to ""Come on Eileen."""
1876,"This is the grand daddy sausage/dog place in town. Doug had managed to turn sausages into a gourmet style meal. This is one of the first places I've seen with duck fat fries, and foie gras sausages. Everything is creative, fun, and plain delicious."
1877,"There really isn't much better than ducking out of work on a Friday for some duck fat fries, a dog and a day game. Just remember to bring cash."
1878,It was my first time here and it was amazing! I ordered a regular dog and a foie gras dog. Both were excellent. I was hesitant to try the foie gras dog but after taking a bite out of it I was very surprised to find it quite delicious and extremely savory. The garlic aioli combined with the foie gras was divine. The duck fat fries were also very good. They were crunchy and not too salty. They are a definite must-try item :D
1879,"How fitting that Hot Doug's ends my reviewing hiatus. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel! That is all that needs to be said."
1880,Best Hot dog place I found in Chicago so far. Very proud and Artsy place. You can even et memorabila. Always be prepared for a 45 minute line outside of the place if there isnt one thats not normal. They have hotdoges I never heard of in my life. They are so good. I got the Foie Gra one and a grilled Chicago Style one. Both were Marvelous. Prepare to adjust the belt buckle of one of these dogs. They seve Duck fat fries unfortunatly just on the weekends
1881,"We waited for almost 2 hours but I don't regret it. Hot Doug's has a great variety of dogs and it's a great atmosphere. Since this will likely be the only time we are at Hot Dougs, we ended up ordering 4 different dogs plus an order of cheese fries and an order of duck fat fries. All of the dogs were good and we appreciated Doug taking the time to make recommendations on toppings etc - he's very nice also. The fries were great but I honestly couldn't taste the difference between the regular and duck fries. After trying their competitor's hot dogs, I can say confidently that Hot Doug's has the best dogs in Chicago."
1882,Hot Doug's takes a nostalgic entree and creates a unique experience that is only experienced upon eating at Hot Doug's. I've been here multiple times with new guests each time and everyone who I have brought here raves about Hot Doug's. Need I mention Anthony Bourdain filmed here? This place takes the cake.
1883,"I heard much about Hot Doug's and after visiting, they did not disappoint. I tried their celebrity special which was a hot dog with apple embedded within the dog with blue cheese and honey on top. Despite the bizarre sounding combo, it was rich in flavor and left me wanting more. Their original fries are fantastic and I highly recommend them. The only reason why this place is not a 5 star spot in my opinion was the 45 minute wait. But if you can afford the time, I highly recommend visiting this Chicago hotspot."
1884,"I had their Chicago Dog, which was great, but I wouldn't wait in line for more than 15 mins for it. Maybe I'm not a hot dog aficionado, but I don't think hot dogs are worth that long of a wait. If you do wait the line (I waited 1.5 hrs on a Saturday afternoon), I would definitely try one of their glorified hot dog's which is worth the wait and hype, but maybe for just a one time deal. I had the ""spicy jerk pork sausage"" which had great flavors. Lastly, everyone talks about the duck fat fries. I got a side of those and wasn't really all that impressed. They were a little soggier than I would like and the flavor didn't really come out. Next time, I would just order regular fries. Be aware it is cash only!"
1885,"hands down, best specialty dogs in the chi.. everyday that theyre open, hot doug (the actual owner) takes your order and makes you feel extremely welcome. every dog is prepared with the utmost love and care that you can taste with every single bite. (celebrity sausage and game of the week are usually the way to go) weekends have duck fat fries, which i havent noticed a difference between regular fries, but theyre also prepared with deep fried goodness :) the only negative would be the line...you can never tell when the line is going to be around the block or jus a few ppl in the front door, but theres always a line..cash only too. this is a must stop when coming to the chi!"
1886,"The Bomb!!!! Well worth the wait no matter how long. A must for locals and Chitown visitors alike. Duck fat fries...are you kidding me? Sublime!!!! (Friday & Saturday Only) Encased meats really do rule the day at Hot Dougs, my friend. The duck with assorted other things in the encasement that Im not even sure what they are, served with bleu cheese...fogettaboutit!!!! The traditional dog is on the menu, but should only be ordered as a side order to the gourmet dogs. You must eat at least three dogs per visit, no questions asked! Group eating is the way to go, because by my estimate, if you go in a group of 5-6 you can pretty much order every thing on the menu and share a little of all! Doug, you truley are an artist with the encased meat product....All Hail Doug, as we are not worthy!!"
1887,"Hot Doug's : Sausages :: Kuma's Corner : Burgers One day I had a corned beef sausage topped with swiss cheese, russian dressing, and kraut alongside some duck fat fries. I've never been to Spain, but I kinda like the music. I've never been to Heaven, but I've been to Hot Doug's."
1888,"I almost hate to give Doug's such a good review, for fear that it will become too over crowded... but fear not - Doug, himself, keeps it running smooth and just an over all AWESOM place! My favorite is the spicy pork jerk... mmmm! Really, it's all good! Go and enjoy my favorite dog place in the city! :)"
1889,You can not ever be hungry enough to go to Hot Dougs! Too many new brats and dogs to ever taste them all. (As a visitor) This is Chicago Hot Dog mecca. Go now.
1890,"Huge line or not, Hot Doug's is pretty much untouchable. Having eaten here regularly for years, I cannot recall a single bad meal. I recall one solitary chicken sausage special that I thought was a bit ""eh"" on the Hot Doug's scale, but otherwise the food is always top notch. I almost always order something from the specials menu, often a variety of chicken sausage, but the regular menu items are also great. The fries are insanely good, and I've never even gone for the duck fat fries because I can't imagine them being any better than the ones served every other day of the week. Also, their fountain Coke is top notch. Best fountain Coke in the city, I think. Saturday will always be busy. I've arrived there at 10:30 some mornings, thinking I'd beat the line, and it's always at least out the door by that time, if not firmly around the corner. If you can come mid-afternoon during the week (yes, I work a full time job in the Loop too, but sometimes am going to/from the office during the day and sneak by), there will barely be a line and you can have your food in under ten minutes. If I moved from Chicago, Hot Doug's would probably be one of the things I missed most, and friends of mine who have moved list Hot Doug's among the top things missed about the city. If I could give Doug more than 5 stars, I would. Also, unless the line is out of control and your family is impatient, this is a great place to take family visiting from out of town. Sure you'll get the ""I'm waiting in line for a hot dog?"" look from some of them, but it will all make sense when they get their first sausage or dog in them."
1891,"I never really ate hot dogs until I moved to Chicago. Even then, they always seemed a little...lame. They weren't a real food, not very tasty, so on and so forth. Then along came an office outing to Hot Doug's. I was assaulted by the sheer amount of choice available to me, ranging from the type of dog (""encased meat"", as they call it here), to various toppings for the hot dog. All of it is delicious. The restaurant is exactly as you'd think it would be: loud, obnoxious, and altogether lovable. You'll wait in line for a bit to get in, but it's worth in the end. I really wish that I'd know about this place when I still lived in the area."
1892,"This place is a Chicago treasure. It is one of the first stops when I host guests from out of town. The menu is large and selections creative, yet it changes constantly, so it is impossible to tire of the selections. Favorite items return, and new choices pop up weekly. The duck fat french fries are dynamite. Also, the fun ambiance and Doug himself make each trip one of the most unique, anticipated, and enjoyable experiences in the city. Downside: long lines... In this case, it is well worth the wait! The menu is creative ."
1893,"Dogs that are worth the wait. And you will wait. Outside. You've been warned. Oh, and it's a lunch thing for sure. They close at 4pm. You've never had a dog like this. Yum! And go with the Foie Gras fries - ya, ya, I know. Poor ducks. Yum!"
1894,"Long lines shlong lines, it's worth the wait! I've tried tons of different hot dog stands in Chicago that have STILL not compared to my beloved Joe's Hot Dogs back home, but I think Hot Doug's is awesome, even if I had to wait almost 40 minutes to place my order. Duck fat fries FTW!"
1895,"on saturday i stood in the freezing cold with 20 mh winds and snow for atleast an hour, but it was worth it in my opinion. We got a bunch of specialty dogs, and the ""Celebrity Dog of the Week"" was this asian-inspired dog which was surprisingly really good (it had sriracha mustard and seaweed salad on top) and this sounds weird, but tasted like sushi! :) the salma hayek was ehhh...and i didnt finish mine... i went for the duck fat fries....and they were greasy, crispy and sooooo good. I seriously couldnt taste the ""duckness"" of the fries... go with a small group, go when the weather is nice, and leave your children at home!"
1896,"Good things come to those who wait. We've all heard this too many times to count. Hot Doug's seems to take it to heart. There is no doubt in my mind that they could make the neccessary adjustments/additions (add another cashier, extend their hours, etc.) to compensate for the traffic overflow. But I think in doing so, it would take away from the experience Doug has created. Yes, waiting is generally not a good thing, but for some strange reason I think it works here. I personally did not mind the wait, which was approximately 30 mintues from end of line to ordering time. You just need to be sure to plan for it. I don't think much needs to be said about the food, it was spectacular. Just be sure to eat it immediately. I think a lot of the flavor is lost and the buns tend to get a bit soggy, if you wait even just a few minutes. The dog toppings are absolutely perfect. Prices are very reasonable for the standard menu, and they don't charge extra for most of the add on toppings. Prices for some of the more unique dogs can add up, but definitely still are worth it; cheaper and much more filling than sushi. (No I am not comparing hot dogs to sushi in terms of types of product, but more in terms of cost of experimentation. Most of us sushi fans have no problem paying $15 for a couple pieces or roll of fish that we've never had. So why not do it on a unique hot dog?) Doug took our order, and I must say, I don't think I have ever had a more polite and eager employee take my order at a restaurant. Overall a very tasty and fun experience."
1897,"Damn you, Hot Doug's. You are always my first choice, and you are ALWAYS busy. :[[ I have yet to find a strategy for avoiding the lines that plague you, but I will never stop coming to you because of it. Even Joey who ""never waits in lines"" and is the most impatient person I've ever met will willingly wait in line to get a dog from Doug. The food here is great, honestly. It's reasonably priced, and Doug really is an amazing personality. He never makes you feel like you are the 1 millionth person he's seen that day. I always attempt to get something from the daily specials, as well as a regular grilled dog. I only ever finish about an entire dog between both of them, because I am so into their fries. The duck fat fries really are fantastic and I am never disappointed when I get them. Hot Doug's gets 5 stars. Even though I'd like to give them 4 because of the constant line, I can't bring myself to do it. The food just really is that fabulously simple and glorious."
1898,"I used to go to Hot Doug's back in High School (4 years ago). This was at its first location, before the fire. I remember going everyday for lunch with a group of my friends, and Doug had all of our orders memorized! It was amazing how he did it! I haven't been to the new location yet but seeing all of these reviews makes me crave it so bad! I will definitely be heading over sometime this summer."
1899,"Hot Doug's really doesn't need another glowing review but oh well! We lived a couple miles from the place so we had the luxury of going when it wasn't busy. It's definitely nice being able to walk right up and order but it is also a little fun to wait in the line out the door with your friends. However, I would say that fun ends after about 20-30 minutes. My best advice is to go on a weekday around 2 or 3 PM. I have a little crush on Hot Doug. He is smart, patient and nice. No hot dog nazi here, he will help you with the menu and does it with a smile. Even though he has a line out the door, he is always nice and will not rush you. I am also very impressed with his mad adding skills. He can write down several different items and add it up so quickly without needing anything. I love the chili cheese fries and getting the chicago dog with chili added. Kinda like bacon...chili goes with everything! I have gone to the other Chicago hot dog landmarks and this one tops them all."
1900,"You had me at duck fat fries. It was a hot crazy delicious mess, not the least because I had been standing in line for two hours in the humid heat of Chicago but damn, so worth it. The dogs are great as well. But the fries...crisp and crackling..."
1901,"There were many times where I passed by Hot Doug's and saw the line outside wrapping around the building and thought, ""Man, that's intimidating."" The day I decided to go to Hot Doug's was this past Saturday during 2pm. Not only was it extremely hot outside, but I felt like I should have brought a folding chair with me. Luckily, there was an ice cream man selling water outside so no one was getting dehydrated! When we finally got to the counter to order it was like a relief. What's so cool is that the owner, Doug Sohn, is there to take your order and he is so so so so nice. Once my almost 2 hours of waiting outside was done and we finally got our food, I was starving. We ordered the Celebrity Sausage of the day which was a Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Goat Cheese. This was my favorite because the sausage and remoulade had a nice spice and the goat cheese smoothed that out nicely! Another delicious pick was the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds. Lastly, we finished our hot dog adventure with the Swiss Cheese Smoked Knackwurst with Smoked Paprika Mayonnaise and Smoked Provolone Cheese. This was a good smoky taste, but I didn't like this one nearly as much as I liked the other two. Since it was Saturday, of course you have to get an order of the duck fat fries. They were good. I don't think they were as delicious as the hot dogs we had, but you have to try them. There was so much food at the table that the fries couldn't be finished. I had a great time, despite the hellish line. Next time, I will remember to go during the fall and bring a chair. :)"
1902,"We waited in line for an hour and a half to pick up our dogs. Worth. Every. Second. We had the duck fat fries (which came in an enormous portion); Buffalo sausage with bacon-garlic mayo and horseradish cheddar cheese; and foie gras and sauterners duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris. The duck sausage was out-of-this world fantastic. It was simply the best thing that I've ever eaten for under $10. This place is amazing. And it's really a must-go-to spot. I will happily wait in that line again."
1903,What else can i say that people haven't already. Duck fat fries are a must. Amazing
1904,"Grubbin! What else can I say about this place. It's famous, even Anthony Bourdain No Reservations came here. Shared half dogs with four of my buddies, so had about 8 different dogs. My fav was defiantly the Foie Gras and sauternes duck sausage w/ truffle aioli. Pretty money. We had some of the favorites too. My other fav was the rabbit dog, lamb sausage with smoked gouda, and the rattle snake sausage. Over all, we're pretty spoiled here in the San Francisco Bay Area, so we have our own dog joints. I would just order what you like. Pros- So many different dogs and toppings Cons- The line was sooooo long. About an hour and a half wait. Over rated but MUST GET!!!- The duck fat fries. They're actually pretty dry."
1905,"I love hot dogs more than anyone else I have ever met, and the Chicago style hot dog is solely to blame for that. I now eat 4+ dogs a week and have my friends concerned about my nitrate intake. Pish posh... That being said, Hot Doug's serves up the best hot dog I have ever had in my life. That is a pretty bold statement. They have everything you could ever want, and if they have it on the menu, the Venison dog is something I would fly back just to get. Honestly, the quality of the duck fat fries is self-explanatory. They will make you swear off fries from elsewhere altogether. They aren't always on the menu, so it's not to say the regular fries arent great... They are about a 9/10. Not to mention that Doug is the man. I love this guy, he's always right out front and resembles Jon Favreau in big glasses, I want to be his best friend. Not only that but a buddy of mine is scheming to get Doug and his sister together to get him into the family. Can't say I blame him."
1906,"I'm not a biggest fan of hot dogs but man is this place awesome! If only I was there when they offer duck fat friess....*mouth watering as i'm typing*. Went there with mi novia and I just had to order the foie gras just because I have never tried it before. It was pretty good but mi novia's elvis's dog was better in my opinion. The service was awesome. He was very friendly and they even brought the food to the table! Ya gotta love the decor of the restaurant. Who doesn't love eating next to a framed photo of britney spears (the old britney, not the crazy one). It seems to make the food even more delicious. What I disliked was the long line out the door in chilly February. Worth the wait though. I'd definitely come back when I'm in Chicago."
1907,"I'll admit that I'm not the biggest hot dog fan, but Hot Doug's has the potential to make me a born again hot dog lover. There are so many types of encased meats to choose from that for a Hot Doug newbie, you could be a bit overwhelmed. But, you can't go wrong with the ever faithful Chicago Dog and the Corn Dog (my first and definitely a good one). My biggest ""beef"" was that it's so far from the train that getting to this place is pretty hard if you can't find a ride. But still, if you are looking for a Chicago tradition I would definitely recommend....just stear clear of lunch time and have cash ready (no credit/debit)."
1908,"Different and delicious! True to the legend, the line was around the corner, just past the back of the building. Big deal. It moved at a decent pace. It did start to rain, but by then I was under the awning- ha! Total wait, just over an hour. Doug has a great personality- he keeps a good rhythm so the flow in & out is steady. My two 'dogs' were a ribeye steak sausage with fried onions and blue cheese, and a uber garlic pork sausage with roasted garlic on top. Both were fantastic. I chose them because they sounded so unique. I igured the standard menu could wait for another visit which will happen, just on a day I have the time to stand and wait."
1909,"The first time our group tried to go we decided not to wait in line. The second time, the line was not too bad and it was moving steadily so we braved the cold. Not going to write much, because its pretty much all been said!! Hot Doug's was super yummy, the staff was efficient, and Doug was patient and friendly working the counter. Everyone tried fun items, and my boyfriend's was super good. I don't remember what the name was, just that it had a sweet curry sauce on it that was amazing. The chili cheese fries were good too. I probably would not order plain fries because I didn't like them that much. Personally, I don't like the hand cut style of fries like they have here and at Five Guys. Good novelty place to take visitors. I probably wouldn't make a habit of going here though. Fun to try!"
1910,"Best Hot Dog/Encased Meats place I've EVER been to. Whatever I got, it was a special ... and it was a while back that I went. What's great about Hot Doug's is that the brilliant owner creates the perfect combination of meat, cheese, and condiment. All of the flavors are wonderfully complimentary and you literally come away from this place feeling like you've tasted something you didn't think you would ever taste. It's simply delicious. We've all been to restaurants where you walk away and feel satisfied. ""It was good."" But whatever you ate didn't permanently alter the chemistry of your brain. And we've all been to a few restaurants in our day where that does happen ... but how often is it a neighborhood hot dog stand? The line goes around the block pretty much every day there, and although I live in Los Angeles, the first place I think of to grab a bite when I come to Chicago ... is Hot Doug's. Delicious. Wait in line. Spend the money on one, two, what the hell - THREE of Doug's specials for the day and chow down. It is well worth it. Oh and the fries are good too ... and I have yet to try the Duck Fat Fried Fries. Keep meaning to go in when they're served, but I always miss it. :( Go to Hot Doug's!"
1911,"I love this place! Yah, yah...the hot dogs are good, that's a given. But what I find the most interesting is that the owner, Doug himself, tends to the register every time they're open. Okay, but back to the hot dogs--they're delicious! Every day the menu varies, but I cross my fingers for BLT. Yah, the line is long but that just proves how good it is and it's definitely worth the wait."
1912,"Hot Doug's has become a Chicago legend for the most delicious and creative encased meat concoctions. Hahaha. Seriously, this place is the best!!! You will find everything from the most basic hot dogs, knockwursts, polish sausages, and even corn dogs on the menu to sausages made from chicken and pork, foie gras, elk, alligator, ribeye steak. Literally, you name it and it's probably somewhere on the menu covered in smoked cheeses and/or gourmet sauces. I do recommend going during the week if possible when the line is a little shorter and definitely go before noon if it's an option. By the official lunch hour, the line is likely to run out the door and half way down the length of the building. Don't let this discourage you though because your meal will be worth it. Oh, and get the fries cooked in duck fat and then smother them in melted cheese. They're only available on Fridays and Saturdays but oh god they're good."
1913,"I don't know what to say. Perfection in a Hot Dog? Can such a thing exist? Is this the land that I've dreamed of? I look at the rating breakdown and someone gave this establishment two stars. They is an uneducated fool whom can't write good! This restaurant is astounding. He can combine tastes that expand at hit every part of the palate while achieving whatever style desired. Jack Daniels and fennel? Check. Sriracha and seaweed? Check. Forget the fancy just give me a Chicago dog. Check. Oh and by the way, come back again and again. Check. I declare Doug the Master of Hot Dog, the Sultan of Sausage, the Prince of Portable Meat (don't read into that one)."
1914,"After living in Chicago for 3 years I'm soo glad I finally got to try this place out!!! We got there around 1135 on a lovely Saturday, and we were ordering by 1215 (yes i timed this). Doug is such a nice guy, he is so friendly and honest. Someone in front of us ordered a large soda and he suggested them just getting a small since its free refills! So nice! I got the chicken w/gouda and apple...delish! We also got the duck fat fries...honestly if no one told me they were different than regular fries I'm not sure I would've totally noticed. They are really crispy and well cooked! I wasnt sure of what to expect at the establishment itself but its super clean for such a crowded place. And it really wasn't that hard to find seating at all....since I guess how long can it really take to eat a hot dog haha. Definitely try to check this place out =) I don't think its super easy to get to by public transportation, but I'm sure it can be done :P"
1915,"I know, I am like the one hold out. While I enjoyed my Hot Doug's experience I feel like it was not worth the Saturday early AM wait. We went at 10:30 am and waited for OVER an hour- yuck. I grew up in Wisconsin and we have amazing variations of Brats that are far more delicous. If you are looking for a real winner order from RJ meats in Hudson, WI and have the killer brats delivered for your own barkyard BBQ. I highly recommend the Jalapeno Cheese and Hawaian brats- yum! http://www.rjmeats.com/"
1916,"Wait times: Monday late afternoon = 30min wait; Saturday afternoon = 2hr wait. The wait times are a harsh reality, so make the most of it and come with some buddies. With all the exposure it's gotten, this place has become a food destination for locals and out of towners alike, so it's kinda like the popular ride at an amusement park. The duck sausage and foie gras one is insanely good. At first bite, you're shocked that something this good is eaten hot dog style. The rich duck sausage, creamy foie gras, and earthy truffle aioli make each $2 bite worthwhile. How awesome would it be to be next door neighbors with this place, just sayin`. Five stars for affordable gourmet despite hourly wait times and big ups to Doug for working the register."
1917,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?? Hot Doug's is DELICIOUS. I've been wanting to go for pretty much forever, and since I had nothing else going on, today was the day! We arrived at 11, and the line was already curved around the building. We waited for 47 minutes, which isn't so bad, especially on duck fat fry fridays. We got to the front of the line and the super friendly server took our order-- alligator sausage, game sausage of the week (venison, Antelope, Buffalo and Elk), 1 order of duck fat fries, and 2 cokes. Within minutes our food arrived, and we were in sausage heaven. It was definitely one of those meals where we were too busy eating to talk. The fries were PERFECT, and the sausages crispy and delicious. The unlimited coke was a nice touch, too, esp since the gator was a little spicy. Just a few things to keep in mind: like everyone says, the line takes forever. no good way to take a train. cash only. And this isn't really fast food, it's gourmet food masquerading as junk, so be prepared to be in a full-on food coma at the end of the meal. Lucky for us grad students, a long nap was in our future, where we dreamed of our next meal at hot dougs. mmmm."
1918,"The one negative is the line. Got there at 11:00 and had to wait an hour and half. But once we got in there, it was all good. The sausages were amazing. I had the following: Celebrity Sausage: Irish Banger with Dark Beer Mustard and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese = yum Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel = yum x 2 Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Moody Blue Cheese = yum x outta control! At a certain point though, you go through overload. These are some very rich items, and to throw the duck fat fried french fries, on top, I gonna have to start poppin' Zocor like tic-tacs. Hot Doug's is Top Doug..."
1919,"Best hot dogs in Chicago, hands down. The combination of basic and gourmet options and the quality of the ""encased meats"", ambiance and Doug's demeanor make this place worth the 20 minute wait to get inside."
1920,"Hot Doug's didn't disappoint. It was everything I wanted plus some. I was getting annoyed waiting in a line at 10:30AM, but it was well worth the wait. We ordered 8 dogs+ duck fat fries for three people. Yeah, we are fatties. I had to order a chicago dog just for the heck of it. The best out of the 8 were the Duck sausage and foie gras, Ribeye with horseradish cream sauce and raclette, and the game of the day (alligator). I asked if they had a buy 7 get 1 free deal and he had a EXTREMELY loyal customer show me their Hot Doug's tattoo. (They eat for free as long as Doug is alive). I'm not that loyal, but we were thinking of picking up more dogs before our flight home to Houston. This will definitely be a place I visit when I have time, but I wont be getting a tattoo anytime soon! I'm sure Doug will pass before I do."
1921,"A true Chicago original. There's a reason why people wait in like for 30 to 45 minutes to get this food. Well, several reason: #1, they make a mean Chicago style hot dog and have a revolving menu of specialty dogs and sausages; and #2, the hours are extremely limited. I guess that's the benefit of being crazy busy/popular: You don't have to work when you don't want to. It's well wroth the schlep from wherever you live -- because I guarantee wherever that is, it's gonna be schlep. (Unless you live in Avondale.) Bring a friend or three to keep you company. The wait is part of the ritual, almost a bonding experience. it'll pay off in delicious duck fat fries. I promise."
1922,"When we went last year, I thought the hype was a little outrageous for hot dogs. How good could a hot dog possibly taste? The frugal side of me wanted to order the regular dogs. The health nut in me was scared of the cheese. Instead we decided to go all out. The amount of food we ordered was enough for a tiny country in Africa. Now after moving to LA, where reviews & prices are always inflated, I'm appreciating just how good Doug's is. The line is awful but there's a reason. Plan around the rush hour. Go gourmet. Get the dog, and get it with cheese."
1923,If you live in chicago this place is a MUST. This guy does brilliant work. I will definitely be back and I live two states away. There is a reason why he cant seem to stay off of the food network and travel channel.
1924,Best hot dogs in the world. Period.
1925,"One of my favorite places to eat.... EVER. Ok, so maybe I just love hot dogs, but this is seriously one of my favs. I take as many out of town guests to this place to truly experience the Chicago dog plus amazing surprising hot dogs. My favorite is the Rib Eye sausage. We were lucky to try the fois gras topped dog before the ridiculous Chicago ban. Duck fat fries really are worth it. I've had them side by side with regular fries, the duck fat ones win hands down Go on a week day if you don't want to wait... or go on those random holidays like Presiden't Day. I love Hot Doug's. Just thinking about it makes me drool."
1926,"I LOVE this place! I wish it was open past 4pm...I don't live or work anywhere near the restaurant so going to get Hot Doug's is only possible for me on a Sat...I had the blue cheese pork and gyro dog on my last two trips and they were fabulous! Sweet and Savory! The Really Good: DEEELISH hot dogs, drool-worthy duck fat fries (only offered fri and sat), and friendly staff. The Not So Good: Limited Hours, LONG lines and Pricey (for their daily specials, their regular menu is reasonable $1.50-$4.00), and limited seating. The Verdict: Despite it's limited hours and high price point, you can't beat the unique meat and flavor combos and the fact that Doug himself rings you up!"
1927,"Wow! This Place is off the charts good... I left off a star beacause after waitng in line for 25 minutes we see a sign that says ""CASH ONLY"" so I had to leave hit an ATM and go back and wait... But the Bell Pepper and chicken dog was unreal, we ordered a few different ones Duck and Prime rib... worht the two 25 minute linesThis place is genius! ***BRING CASH... EXPECT A LINE, GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME****"
1928,Love it! The hot dogs are not only different and amazing but Doug himself is possibly the kindest man ever. I wish they had longer hours and another location. I would eat here every day!
1929,"Waited in the freezing cold for 45 minutes for this -- worth the wait. I enjoyed the excitement of everyone in my group as we inched closer to the counter -- place has quite a following. I'm only a recent convert to eating any form of sausage -- so I was skeptical -- but I tried the rattlesnake dog and it was pretty delicious. Also, I couldn't believe our group of 7 could eat 5 baskets of duck fat fries, but I was looking for more. P.S. Hot Doug's sponsored my ultimate frisbee team -- so cool."
1930,"Long live! Best hot dog/sausage creations in the city. I strongly recommend the Rib Eye Steak Sausage, if they have it. It's possibly the best tasting thing ever. Doug is a fine gentleman."
1931,"I thought I had the whole hot dog thing down with Al's Beef and Portillos which are virtually the same dog. Then I went to Hot Dougs. Nobody can even touch this place. I dont know how but the dogs are just better than the other two. The duck fat fries send this place over the edge. #1 in Chicago for hot dogs hands down!!!! Another great dog is Gold Coast Dogs, especially with their cheese fries. They use the real Wisconsin Cheddar!"
1932,"Yummy Hot Dogs. I got got the ""Keira Knightly"", which is a slightly spicy dog. I don't get the reference...is it bc she is hot? Well it was fabulous. I like their ""everything combo."" The celery salt is a really nice finishing touch. I heard that the line gets long, but today was my first attempt and was a successful one....I guess bc of the snow. Great dogs, better than flub a dub chubs on Broadway. Hot Dougs has way more sausage selection."
1933,I went to Hot Doug's. I had to wait in line. Doug was really nice. The food was really good. You should go here some time.
1934,"Sometimes, when life has been too calm, I will come to Yelp and look at the one and two star reviews of Hot Doug's and work myself into a righteous fury of indignation. Who would hate Hot Doug's? Cruel, heartless people with no joy in their hearts for tasty sausages. That's who. If you can't stand the line, get out of it and chase lesser (though admittedly faster) sausages. If you don't really care for sausages, what on EARTH are you doing at the shrine to all things sausage? If you object to the price, get the Chicago dog ($1.75! What costs less than $2 these days?), or buy some duck and foie gras and try making your own damn gourmet sausage. If you don't like the way Doug does business, I have nothing more to say to you, except ""Good day, you fool."" I have not completely loved every sausage of Doug's, but the sausages I HAVE loved are legion. The catalonian pork sausage. I would eat this with almost any toppings. Or none. It is the best sausage on its own merits. The rabbit and white wine. The mountain man. The three chili wild boar. I could go on. No one, not even Doug, can guarantee you will love the sausage you order. You, noble lover of Hot Doug, are a unique human with wild vagaries of taste. Maybe today you aren't really feeling like anything especially rich, in which case the Bacon Sausage is not going to make you happy on this day. Maybe you really love pork, in which case the chicken sausage will disappoint. Maybe, no matter how much people talk it up, you just don't like duck (who ARE you?) and the foie gras dog will fall short of the hype. In any event, if you go to Doug's and do not love it, I never want to be seen with you."
1935,"I am a vegetarian who loves Hot Doug's. There, I said it. Why do I love Hot Doug's? Because they serve the best veggie hot dog in the world. Two Pete Shelley's with some cheese fries and a diet Coke is pure heaven. Obviously, I can't speak to the meat products Doug dreams up, but my carnivorous friends tell me they are all that and more. So just go, okay? But maybe get behind me in line."
1936,"Hot Doug's!!! I visited you twice and had to turn away because of the RIDICULOUS minimum 2-hour long wait. AAARGH I am shaking my fist to the sky! In fact, I'm so frustrated, I might start my own hot dogs business RIGHT outside your restaurant. Me and my hot dog cart will make a KILLING while you make people wait for hours and hours and hours for some supposedly crazy-delicious dogs."
1937,"There is nothing I can say about Doug that has not already been said. Hot Doug's is a one-in-a-billion hot dog shop, and Doug is a hero in the food world. I hope Hot Doug's continues to be an iconic beacon for the reinvention of comfort food and American cuisine."
1938,"Arrived at Doug's on a Saturday morning and we were greeted with a long line out front. We waited for a total of 2 hours to get our food. Sounds crazy right? But I'm telling you it was worth every minute. The anticipation to get your hands on the famous duck fat fries and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. This was the weird part for me, I knew the food was going to be so bad for me, yet I was willing and able to scarf it all down. The great mystery of the universe I suppose. Ok, onto the food, first things first make sure you bring cash, cash is king here, no credit. Good thing my buddy had cash ready to go. Now here comes the hardest part, deciding what to order. There are plenty of choices ready for you and your stomach is limited. I had the duck fat fries, the Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mustard, and the Mole and Chipotle Smoked Chicken Sausage. I was most intrigued by the duck fat fries, they taste like regular fries but they are heavy and make you full real quick. O by the way, my heart stopped for a second or two eating them. I thought I needed a defibrillator to get my heart going again. The quality of the sausages are top notch, very succulent and plenty of flavors. I really like the garlic pork sausage and I will also try the foie gras next time I'm in town. Doug's is a great outing and the quality and uniqueness can't be beat. Now it's time to run 20 miles to burn off one duck fat fry."
1939,"All I can add is that Doug actually talked me out of buying a Large Coke, told me to ""buy the small, you get free refills"". He probably said this so we don't linger, but I'm still impressed. Got there on Sat. (1/30/10) morning at 10am, were third in line. I ordered the Foie Gras duck sausage and duck fat fries and a thuringer. Have to admit being let down a little on the fries. Perhaps too much hype anticipation. Funny thing is, the fries were actually better a few hours later. Not sure why. Anyways, I would of been just fine with the foie gras dog, fries and Mr. Pibb. I bought the other one just 'cause I was there. Next time, just one. Good stuff. Thanks Doug."
1940,"Possibly the best meal I've ever had. Ever. Sorry, mom. Look at the menu. Amazing! Try a few! Doug is a culinary genius! He has truly improved on an American Classic. I, unofficially, give him the title of ""Best Hot Dog in the World."" WARNING: Go at an off hour to minimize the line waiting. Cash only. Bring a friend you like to talk to."
1941,"I realized I am just a Yelp Hater. I only write about bad plaaces that I'm frustrated with. So I thought, ""what do I like?"" And Hot Dougs came to mind. Love the duck-fat fries, and the normal fries too. I also love the normal dogs... and the specials! Great stuff, a must have for a Chicago traveler."
1942,"If there were 6 stars, I would have given it to this place. It was amazing. I waited over an hour to get to the register, but as soon as I finally had the opportunity to place my order - Doug greeted me as if I was the only person in the place. He asked me how I was, I didn't feel rushed, and he actually guaranteed me a seat despite the fact that they were (obviously) incredibly busy. Sure enough, I got my Cherry Coke and when I turned around, the staff was cleaning off a table for me and my friends. Amazing. I ordered a regular hot dog with everything plus sauerkraut, a Smoked Shrimp and Bleu Cheese dog with Remoulade Sauce, duck fat fries, and a small Cherry Coke - $14.50....and worth. every. cent. Everything was completely delicious. The dogs were flavorful and grilled to perfection. The entire staff was so friendly and relaxed, the place was clean and bright, and 80s music played in the background. It was the perfect way to spend an afternoon."
1943,"What a fun place! At first I was really overwhelmed by the line, but after awhile it really just became part of the experience. My friends and I started chatting with everyone in line and we all jsut got really excited about Hot Doug's! The hot dogs are beyond amazing. I didn't even know gormet hot dogs could possibly exist before I went here -- but after going I can say with complete certainty that they do! All of the flavors and ingredients come together perfectly. My friends and I each ordered about 2-3 differnt kinds of hot dogs, cut them up, and sampled all the different kinds. My favorite was one that had saffron and smoked gouda. We also had the duck fat fries and they were absolutely amazing. I would reccomend this place to anyone looking for a fun and delicious Chicago experience but just make sure it's nice weather and you've got some time because the line goes wayyyyy out the door!"
1944,"4 stars only for the 1.5 hour wait! Otherwise, great service, great dogs, amazing selection of menu items! Go Friday or Saturday to get the duck fat fries!"
1945,"How they do it, I'll never know. Brilliant."
1946,"We got there around 11 and waited about 45 min, not too bad for the time. I was surprised at how seating just seemed to work out. It flowed well. Once we ordered, the food came out fairly quickly, maybe not even 10 min... we got the game of the week (pheasant and bacon or something) and the foie gras, duck fat fries n cheesy fries. I think I set my expectations too high, cuz I was sort of disappointed. The fries were tasty, but the foie gras was only ok... I think i'd come back to try something new though!"
1947,"You have to wait 45 minutes minimum in rain, snow or shine just to get a hot dog. What else can you say about Hot Dog's than go early and go often. Doug is awesome and funny and his encased meats are amazing! I have never had a dog there that was interesting if not delicious! Also the duck fat fries are maybe one of the best things on the planet."
1948,"Oh, Hot Dougs.... I've only been there twice, but I'm in love. Yes, there's a long wait. Get over it. It's well worth the wait, and honestly I don't think anyone in line cares. Yes, it is crazy packed just about every time you go there. At most small places like this, I would expect a situation like that to make the staff rude and rushed. But not here. Doug is patient and friendly. He takes his time with your order and is happy to explain anything on the menu to you. It's nice to see a smiling face after waiting in line for an hour. Also - I am so glad that they offer a vegetarian Hot Dog. I have no idea what it's made of, but it. is. DELICIOUS. Also, the selection of toppings and specials is fantastic. A+ for food. A+ for customer service. Go wait in the line. You won't regret it."
1949,"I ran here from Hyde Park - 14 miles - in early April, in the rain, for Doug's encased meats. Unfortunately, the line-out-the-door's pace of movement is glacial and so was my core body temperature by the time - 45 minutes later - that I even managed to make it under the paltry awning. It was more than an hour before I got hot food - 3 dogs and duck fries - in my belly. By then, my lips were blue, I was literally shivering, and I was an hour and a half away from home via bus-El-bus. But, to be fair, if my quest for Hot Dougs almost killed me, the dougs themselves veritably gave me new life."
1950,"I long to get back to Hot Doug's, preferably on a Friday or Saturday so that I can try their duck fat fries. Anything with ""duck"" and ""fat"" in the name just seems irresistible. I'm having unnatural thoughts about them right now. But when I did get to Hot Doug's earlier this year, I was so impressed with their Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel selection. As a francophile who enjoys anything sounding remotely French, I had to try this heart attack on a bun. It was so good I wish I had ordered two. They will be closed December 24, 2010-January 4, 2011 so I'll have to find time to try it out before their vacation!!! Merry Christmas to me :)"
1951,"DO NOT GO HERE......during peak lunch hours (the lines get LONG). Other than that, if you're in the Chicago area and love dogs, it will be a crying shame not to visit Hot Doug's. This place has the BEST dogs that I've ever eaten in my life! Parking is on the street (free) and the restaurant has about a dozen tables and some counter space (and some tables outside). The line is usually out the door no matter what time you go but it moves farily quickly. The two times I've visited here, I went after 1:00 pm so the line wasn't too bad. The service here is nothing short of EXCELLENT and the menu has a varied selection of dogs and specialty dogs (ie: Ribeye Steak dog). I ate the Ribeye Steak dog and the Mole Chipotle Chicken Sausage dog and actually had dreams about it that night.....it was that good. The fries are pretty good, especially the cheese fries. The large order is enough for two people. Although the prices for the specialty dogs are a bit high (averages around $8.00), it is definitely worth it. They don't accept plastic so bring cash. DO NOT leave Chicago without visiting Hot Doug's....you can thank me later!"
1952,"There is, and I absolutely stand by this statement, some sort of mystical connection between the University of Chicago and Hot Dougs. Each of the half-dozen time's I've been up there I have either heard someone discussing the University or actually seen someone who attends it. It's bizarre. I wonder if everyone has had this experience... Ah...what can I tell you about Hot Dougs? I would only be saying o'er what has already been said before. Only in one respect do I differ from the 150+ reviews already posted: I think duck fat fries are overrated. There, I've said it. They're good, but not significantly better than the regular fries, and certainly not deserving of the fetishistic worship that they receive. The sausages, on the other hand? Yeah. They're that damn good."
1953,"The duck fat fries and heavenly selection of encased meats makes the wait outside (around the corner and good length down the block) all worth it. They move pretty quickly thanks to a highly efficient (but mildly terrifying) seating system - don't pick your own seat, they will give it to you, and ONLY after you've ordered! Don't fuck this up. When I went I had their game of the week - a chipotle buffalo sausage with mustardy cheese (not the official name) and split an order of duck fat fries with my friend. Trust me, this is the way to go. The fries are delicious, but lets try not to move up the national obesity list Chicago. The sausage itself was perfect, the cheese was perfect, the mustard was perfect - you really can't miss out on Hot Doug's. The selection ranges from your typical Chicago dog to quite a few unique and ""gourmet"" specialty dogs. All fantastic. One more thing, they are CASH ONLY, so if you limit yourself to your debit card because otherwise you'll go on a paper money fueled spending spree (why plastic keeps me in line, I'll never know) don't forget to stop at the ATM before heading over."
1954,"Nothing I say here will emphasize more how great this place is. Worth every 2 hours I will spend waiting. (Plus you always make friends in line) The Foie Gras dog is in the top 5 things I have ever put into my body. Having just moved back to Chicago, I was in need of my decadent treat"
1955,"TWO WORDS: Encased Meat. I have been here only a few times, but this place has the best sausage. Hands down. Beef, pork and garlic is my favorite sausage, coupled with duck fat fries. Heat attack waiting to happen. Stand in line. Eat your heart out. It's worth the wait."
1956,"I started going to Doug's about 4 years ago just for the plain dogs-which are awesome. In the past few years the wait has become excrutiating so when I do feel like waiting the half hour I try to be adventurous. Being adventurous is easy at Doug's-I generally go for ""the Game of the week"" which is a sausage of some type of game meat. I'm generally very happy with the food there, it's creative, it's tasty, it's something you can't get anywhere else. Doug is always at the front counter, and he's super friendly, and helpful and while I do agree the hours are stupid- I'd rather have the stupid hours than have it be open all the time with doug there only half the time."
1957,"Hot Doug's gets the elusive 5 star tating. Where else can you get rattlesnake sausage, grand marnier pate and cheese-stuffed pepper toppings, and (my favourite) DUCK FAT FRIES? A HUGE part of the charm is Doug himself, who is responsible for the wild concoctions, the hilarious decor, and the friendly, witty service. He always mans the register. For people who can't handle the hours, would you like to work an extra 6 hours in addition to your regular shift each day? Doug is there all day long, 6 days a week. Give the man a holiday once in a while, and evenings and Sundays off. I personally don't want another manager behind the counter. It wouldn't be the same without him. A helpful tip is on the restaurant's website itself: ""We take a ton of holidays off. Call to make sure we're open first."" Not incredibly difficult."
1958,"Came early for lunch on Friday, since the duck fat fries are only available Fridays and Saturdays. This place is WAAAAAAY over-hyped. I came early enough where I didn't have to wait long, my meal was paid for by my work, and I STILL didn't enjoy my experience. Maybe the secret to this place is that people wait so long in line that by the time they get their food, they're so hungry that anything will taste amazing ... If you're visiting and want to try a Chicago hot dog, for the love of god, just find any place that uses Vienna Beef (a lot of places will have the Vienna Beef sign on the window), 'cause that's what makes the Chicago hot dog better than any other. Anyways, this is what I tried: Duck fat fries - these weren't crispy enough; I've had better duck fat fries elsewhere; they were still good, though, 'cause c'mon, they're fries ... The Dog (Chicago-style hot dog) - the best thing I had here by far, but the same dog you'll find in most Chicago hot dog joints The Mountain Man: Elk, Venison, Buffalo and Antelope with Cassis Butter and Coolea Cheese - the dog was a little dry and flavorless; who would trust the palate of a mountain man, anyway? Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Truffle Sauce Moutarde, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris - this was only so-so, and proof that truffles can't save everything; as befitting such a hoighty toighty dog, once you get past the fancy description, there's really not that much substance Calvados-Infused Smoked Duck Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey - this was decent; if you don't like spice, avoid this dog ... In fact, save your time and money and just avoid this place altogether ..."
1959,"If you like sausage and you haven't been to Hot Doug's yet, what the heck are you waiting for? True the lines could be long, and sure the prices for a bit steep for the specialty sausages. But I think they have a name for a Hot Doug's with no line and cheap prices, which is Heaven. At that point, you may want to check if you're still alive... There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. Oh, I know. Celery Soda. Yes, indeed! I figured that while I was being somewhat adventurous with my meats, I might as well try a beverage out of the cold case made out of my vegetable enemy (or ""vegenemy"" if you will). It was surprisingly good! It reminded me of ginger ale, but you get that distinctive taste of celery instead of that gingery spiciness that comes with a quality ginger ale. God bless you, Mr. Doug, for the work that you do!"
1960,"http://jimandbrittneyeat Still on our quest to make our way through the la Card list, we decided to take an afternoon off for Jim to experience some serious sausage. Even though it was 1pm on a February weekday, the line still wrapped around the building, as usual. But we weren't swayed. The first time Brittney went to Hot Doug's, she was still eating meat. And visions of ostrich sausage and duck fat fries danced in her head. This was going to be interesting... When we finally reached the counter after 45 minutes of taking turns to be in the sunlight and rubbing our denim-clad jeans with our hands, I approached Doug with a plea. ""It's great to see you again, Doug. Kate says hi. So... well... um, last time I visited, I still ate meat, but now I don't. Is there any way I can order one of the special sausages but get a veggie dog instead? I'll pay the price for the special!"" Without hesitation, the ever-friendly Doug replied, ""Why would you do that? You can pay the price of a veggie dog. What would you like?"" The Pete Shelley (AKA veggie) is only $2.75. Doug is a saint! After some friendly hassling from Doug about ""when I'd be coming back over from the dark side,"" I ordered the Pete Shelley with apple chutney and manchego cheese. Although I did miss the heartiness of a real-meat sausage, these ingredients could make anything taste like heaven. Whether this was meant to be boar, rabbit, or dinosaur, it likely would've been a little juicier with some animal fat, but the cheese and chutney were really tasty. I also ordered the Pete Shelley with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Burning Nettles Smoked Gouda Cheese. Again, a veggie dog is a little slight for such a big bun, but I paid under $3 for some awesome ingredients. Good show, old chap. ...and of course, cheese fries (minus the duck fat). These chips are cooked in, um, regular fat? My heart might have stopped momentarily after ingesting maybe half of these, but that didn't stop them from being delicious. Jim, being the meat fanatic that he is, was like a kid in a candy store... Or like a man in a sausage store. He ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. In honor of this great city, he also ordered a traditional Chicago dog... and how could he resist the duck fat fries? Hot Doug's is a serious must for all that call themselves Chicagoans. It's not in the most convenient location in the city, and there will definitely be a wait, but it's well worth it. Hot Doug's never disappoints."
1961,"I've been here twice and I love the food. I don't remember what I got the first time...I just remember being overwhelmed with great food. The second time I went, I went in a small group again. We all shared the Ribeye Steak Sausage w/ Crispy Fried Onions & Blue Cheese , the Bacon & Jalapeno Duck Sausage w/ Brie Cheese, and the Foie Gras & Sauternes Duck Sausage. We all enjoyed the food and even though we had to wait in line for an 1.5 hours, it was worth it. If you go on Fridays and Saturdays, BE PREPARED to wait in longer lines. However, their duck fat fries are awesome, so it's up to you if you have the patience to stand in line."
1962,"This place is dangerous because I work right across the street. My coworkers and I will periodically check the line outside, and when the line isn't out the door and around the corner (most of the time it will be, rain, shine, snow, frigid temperatures, whatever) we quickly dash over to grab some delicious gourmet hot dogs, and (if it's a Friday) duck fat fries! They have the usual fare as well (corn dogs, Chicago Hot Dog) but what you REALLY want to try are the specials, which are rotated around every few weeks or so. I have yet to try everything on the menu (I tend to stay away from the spicy), but usually I'll go for some sort of meat sausage with fruit and cheese. DELICIOUS. Oh and the foie gras dog (made famous by Bourdain's TV show) is great as well. I've been coming here for three years. Doug himself will greet you to take your order every single time and he's a great, charismatic guy! Make sure you check the site before you go, both to decide what you want to order, and to make sure he's not on vacation. They'll take random vacations around the year and the restaurant will be closed during that time."
1963,"This one is long overdue, seeing as I went back in September, but nonetheless - I still have to say this place is amazing. We waited for almost an hour and a half, and I can't say it wasn't worth it. Duck fat fries + 2 of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten. No lie. So good. You don't know the possibilities and potential of hot dog's until you go to Hot Doug's. And the kicker, Doug serves every customer, as probably the happiest guy you'll ever meet. Worth the trip & the wait."
1964,All I have to say... It's worth the wait in line. Everyone is so friendly and the dogs can't be compared to anything else in the city. SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!
1965,"Sure some people may think it's crazy to wait over an hr in a line that runs down the block for a hot dog. Granted, yes they are just hot dogs, but to me they're not just any dogs. Where else in the city are you going to find a variety of delicious gourmet sausages topped of with an interesting combination of ingredients? Doug was at the front taking orders (as always from what I understand) and fun to talk and joke around with. Service was fast, tables opened up quickly where we didn't have to wait long or wait at all. I went on a Sat and the dogs and duck fat fries were delicious and the rolls were fresh. To me..it was definitely worth the wait (but maybe not on a freezing day)."
1966,"Can't add too much here. This review might go a little differently if it were rainy and cold during my 'short' 30 minute wait outside. I appreciated the decor inside the place. Lots of personality and quite informative. After having a 5 minute discussion with Doug about how I'm shocked he's not Korean (he told me his last name Sohn is obviously shortened from something, although I did not manage to find out his ethnicity) Talk about a friendly guy. You can tell he's there because he genuinely wants to be and loves people. So, if you're waiting in line a long time, you'll realize that the owner's wanting to appreciate you with quality time when you order. Figuring I wouldn't be returning very frequently (due to the wait), I decided to try 3 items: the antelope, cognac lamb/pork, and the highly touted fois gras. While it was obvious I wasn't paying $8-9 for presentation (we're talking cased meats here), every single flavor combination was so interesting, I was glad to have a few bites of each and a menu handy to remind me exactly what I was tasting. The duck fat fries tasted like.....fries. Believe me, I REALLY wanted to think there was something special about them, but my palette really couldn't pick it up. So, I decided to just give them a good whiff, and that's when I noticed it. There was something subtly different about their aroma, albeit too subtle to pick up with my tongue. Oh, well.... If it's a nice day out and you have the time, try it!"
1967,"I'm sorry Hot Doug. I wanted to love you. I wanted to eat your foie gras and duck sausage and die and go to heaven like so many other yelpers. And since I waited an hour in line and am indecisive, I also ordered a a regular ""The Dog"" (described as a ""Chicago style hot dog"") to see if Hot Doug's turned a basic Chicago dog into something magical. So... ""The Dog"" was just a Chicago hot dog, definitely not worth waiting and ordering from there. And the foie gras dog.. I mean, it was tasty.. was it 5 star amazing? no. I wouldn't wait an hour for it. If I happened to drive by and didn't see a line out the door, then I'd stop by and order it (and maybe try the Game of the Day), but other than that, trying it once to see what the hype was about was enough for me."
1968,"I walked about a mile to get to Hot Dougs then waited in line 30 minutes to order... Totally Worth It... Had the standard dog with all the fixings, foie gras , and the duck fat fries - never have I wished more that I was Joey Chestnut so I could sit there and polish off the whole menu. Doug took my order and was great you can tell he loves what he is doing and takes pride in serving such great and inventive foods. I can't wait to get back to Chicago to go here again"
1969,"Expect to wait in a long, long line, especially on a Friday or a Saturday. I spent a slightly chilly spring afternoon waiting in line ~1 hour. It was a worthwhile experience. I ordered: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($9) - very flavorful and delicious. The Marty Allen (formerly the Don Rickles) beef, pork and garlic sausage ($3.25) - nothing special. pass on for next time. Duck Fries ($3.50) - The fries were all right. I didn't taste what the hype was about, but maybe my expectations were too high. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't know if I would wait for that long again (or longer...) to have another go."
1970,"So much hype for Hot Doug's, especially since it has now been featured on both the Travel Channel and Food Network. I have to say that it more than lived up to my expectations! We decided to brave it this past Saturday so we could take advantage of the duck fat fries (only available Fri and Sat). After waiting in line for over 2 hours (hence the deduction of one star because, seriously? 2 hours?), we stepped up to the plate and ordered the following: - Chicago Dog - Thuringer Dog - Atomic Dog - Foie Gras Sausage - Bacon & Jalapeno Duck Yep. The two of us polished off 5 dogs/sausages plus an order of duck fat fries. Gotta say, I would almost wait 2 hours for those fries alone! I would definitely recommend ordering whatever spicy specialty they have as the Atomic and Bacon/Jalapeno were our favorites."
1971,"It would get 5 stars, but the waits are just ridiculous. While reading some of the reviews, I have found myself envious of people complaining about a mere 45 minute wait. The last few times I have been here, I have waited well over an hour to place my order. And yes, I have tried to go on ""off hours"" and ""non-duck fat days"", but there are no off hours here. That being said, there really isn't a better hot dog on this planet. I am not talking about the standard Vienna Beef dogs, polish, etc, there are many who are equal, and some maybe even better. I am talking about the Specials, or the five-star fine-dining experiences somehow morphed into the form of a hot dog that are selling from $7-$8. If you see the words ""bacon sausage"" on the menu do NOT hesitate! The fries are also worth some room in your stomach, even the ones not fried in duck fat (Fri. & Sat. only). In the future, I will try phoning ahead for take-out, but if you must eat-in, be prepared to: 1) take 2 hours to complete this experience 2) wait outside for an hour, even in sub-zero temperatures!"
1972,"You will wait. You will wait some more. You will pay in cash only. It is worth every second of the wait and then some. Say hi to Doug, he is quite possibly the friendliest person in town."
1973,"Been wanting to try this place forEVER and finally did the other day. OMG!!!! The line was a beast, but the dog and fries were SO worth the wait! Such a unique tasting dog and I love the options! I'm sorry Gene & Jude's, Hot Doug's has stolen my heart!"
1974,"I had the unfortunate experience of coming here on a holiday weekend, which means that the normal 45 minute wait was double that. Despite this long and wretched wait... it was still worth it. Our group of 8 was able to sample all the special hot dogs, and they were all damn good. My favorite had to be the duck sausage topped with foie gras. Some in our group said that they were glad they just had a bite, cuz they weren't sure if they could finish a whole dog. I'm pretty sure I could! If you come on a weekend make sure to order the fries fried in duck fat... they're awesome!"
1975,"Like with Kuma's, the wait is always worth it at Doug's. Classic dogs, fries, sausages and an interesting mix of weekly specials. The prices are reasonable, Doug and the staff are incredibly friendly and the food is great. This place is in a league of its own."
1976,"I can't seem to go to Chicago without going to Hot Doug's. There is nothing to complain about here. Everything inside is worth the wait! Food, decor, staff! It's all amazing! Don't miss out on the daily special dogs and the duck fat fries!!!!!!!"
1977,"If the sight of large numbers of trendily-turned-out youngsters turns your stomach, proceed with caution. The duck fat fries are available only on Friday and Saturday. If you want them, don't go on a Tuesday, as I just did. For $8.25, I got 2 lovingly prepared char-polish, 1 large fry (handcut and huge; equivalent to the amount you'd usually get with 3 to 4 polish at most places that throw in the fries for ""free"") and 1 Cel-Ray (hoo-rah: a hot dog place that sells this NYC/Jewish favorite). Tax included in all menu prices. The Cel-Ray was $1, a good deal, which left me spending about $7 for two really nice char-polish and enough fries to choke a horse. I'm really happy with that. Many places in town charge that much, many charge more, and the quality in many cases can't match what Doug serves. Doug could probably get away with charging more than he does, but refrains. The owner had a very long-winded conversation with the couple in front of me. I'm usually an insanely (insanely) impatient person, and was starting to wonder to myself when the f*ck they were all going to get around to filling out an order form, but outwardly I kept my cool. The owner seems to be sincere in the personal touch he brings to the front counter. The hospitality at Hot Doug's is truly a 180 from places like Jimmy's at Grand and Pulaski (which I visited earlier this week and liked quite a lot). I didn't try any of the exotic specials, which are a bit spendy. Based on this first Hot Doug's experience today, I'm willing to extend the benefit of the doubt that they are a good value, and will probably get around to treating myself to something ""gourmet."" In any case, Doug's is doing quite well by the classical verities of the Chicago hot dog stand."
1978,"I don't know if it was an off day, but boy were we disappointed with the encased meats. Chicago dog (grilled): dry (how does it get dry?) and tasteless. All I could taste were the condiments...Beef fail. Chili dog: all I remember was that it was very salty. Foie Gras dog: the best of the three, not bad but too salty and not very savory. I'll stick to non-encased foie gras. :("
1979,"Sometimes I want a hot dog. Sometimes I want a hot dog that doesn't suck. When it is that time, I go to Hot Doug's. Hot Doug's has fun hot dogs with crazy stuff like mayonnaise and cheese and rattlesnakes, seriously. Want a cool hot dog that is a serious break from the norm, Check on over to Hot Doug's, it's in a pretty random place and there's a pretty long line, go early."
1980,Love the hot dogs here. would wait in line all day for a hot dog here any day. The fires fried in duck fat are to die for
1981,"Delicious, gourmet sausages, and damn good regular old hot dogs too. In fact, my favorite thing there is the plain old bratwurst. Their brat is fairly mild, but with a really nice mix of spices so it's got great flavor without being too overpowering. Then the weekly specials are always interesting and creative. The duck fat fries are delicious but nothing to write home about. Long lines as well. However, in short: AWESOME! Should be on an episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate, for sure."
1982,"In New Orleans the tourists line up for beignets, in DC they line up for cupcakes and in Chicago they line up for hot dogs. Thursday at 11:50am we waited for 40 minutes and at least it was nice out. The service is great, with Doug upfront and it is amazing to visit an 'iconic' food establishment where the owner loves their customers. The dogs are pretty delicious (I had a tasty Anna Kendrick/Fire Dog which was not as 'mighty hot' as advertised), excellent fixings, good fries and the pricing is spot on. Inside the place has a nice vibe, fun decor and the crowd predominantly 20 and 30 somethings. I like a hot dog like the next person, but I am sure not willing to line up for one."
1983,"After trying Franks and Dawgs, we decided to try our luck at getting a Hot Doug. The line was out the door, but moved relatively quickly. The area was nice, and street parking was free. For the amount of people there, we were still able to get table. I had a apricot and brandy chicken sausage, and hubby had a Chicago style, and the Rattlesnake. Mine was only so-so, and the cheese on top did not seem to go with the sausage. I hated the Rattlesnake. The duck fries are only served on Fridays and Saturdays, so we settled for the regular fries, which were so-so. Disappointing, and so surprising considering the other reviews. I wish the flavors were as good as Franks and Dawgs."
1984,"This was the first place I wanted to go to when I arrived in Chicago! We went during lunch time on a Saturday and there was a long line out the door. I think we were in line for like an hour in the freezing cold. The place was pretty small and cramped in my opinion. When we got to the counter we order like 8 different ""hot dogs"" and some duck-fat fries and cheesy fries to share among 4 people. There were so many varieties so we just wanted a taste. All of the hot dogs we got were pretty good, but the best one was the ""Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel"" This sucker was $10 but it was ohhhhh so worth it. The duck-fat fries was nothing to really rave about. Not much difference from the regular fries. I would definitely want to take a trip back to Chicago and eat here again."
1985,"Tons of people recommended this place to me! I heard the line is normally super long, but me and my bf went here around 3 on a Wednesday, so it was a totally random hour of the day! We only had to wait in line for about 10 minutes because they were super efficient, which was fine because the menu was quite extensive! As soon as we got to the front of the line, Doug greeted us with his friendly smiley face! He seems like a really awesome and chirpy guy, who really enjoys owning his business. He made some great recommendations to us, but was not pushy in the least. We ended up getting a mighty meat (came w/ buffalo, antelope, and all kinds of heavy meats) dog, the salma hayek (kind of spicy with andouille sausage), a classic Chicago style dog, and the foie gras one that everyone kept hyping up on Yelp. The mighty meat tasted very interesting and surprisingly, was one of my favorite dogs - then again, I'm a major meat eater, so I eagerly scarfed this one down! The salma hayek was good, but nothing special - I probably wouldn't order it again. I LOVED the Chicago style dog. This was my first time having one and it tasted just like a hot dog with typical hamburger fixings, such as pickles! So so good! Lastly, the foie gras one was DISGUSTING. I'm sorry, but it just was. I still can't believe I paid $9+ for that stupid hot dog because it tasted nastyyyyy - the texture is totally fatty and falls apart greasily in your mouth, just like lard does. For those Asians, the taste of the actual dog is comparable to bright pink Chinese sausage - only it tastes worse. I still want to barf, just thinking about this hot dog. Thankfully, my loving bf ate this hot dog because he didn't wanna waste money and instead, let me eat the tastier dogs :) He's the best! So to reiterate...do NOT order the foie gras hot dog!!! If I could go back, I would go here on a Friday, so I can get some of them duck fat fries! Those sound freaking delish!!! But...hot diggity dog! This place is mad cool and I would definitely come back."
1986,My car still smells like Hot Doug's.
1987,"I've never had gourmet hot dogs before nor duck fat fries. So I came here for the fries and the experience of why this place is so popular on TV and the locals. I went here with some friends on a Saturday morning at 10:00a and there was a line down the block (doors open at 10:30am!). I was amazed to see a line forming outside as this place. There's only street parking. As I said before, I wanted to check out this place because I've seen it on a few Food Network shows and heard about their duck fat fries. They only took cash and after 45 mins waiting in line and spending about $50 bucks for 4 dogs, 2 fries n 2 drinks, it was worth the experience with friends:) After all that waiting in line, you finally meet Doug taking your order by hand. The turn around of placing your order, sitting down and eating, was a pretty impressive system that they got down pat:) No waiting for a table for us:) The place was pretty small maybe sits about 50 ppl? The bath rooms are single men/women. They have a lot of old memorabilia all over the walls. The staff keeps the place clean (I guess due to it's small size) and they were friendly too. And yes, they have AC! They have daily specials of dogs so check online for a list of them, I'd say while you wait in line. We ordered 12 dogs , 2 for each of us 6 people. The popular ones I've listed are as follows: -Hot Doug's B.L.T.-good toppings, fresh so I would get it again! This was a popular dog in our group. -Thai Chicken Sausage with Sriracha Mustard, Sesame-Seaweed Salad and Duck Cracklings-it was OK if you REALLY like Spicy Asian flavors. -Philly Cheesesteak Sausage with Cream Cheese Mustard, Caramelized Onions and Smoked Provolone Cheese-I liked the flavors, onions chopped into little bits. -Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel-The most expensive dog on the menu $9 bucks, but it was pretty good if you like the creamy texture of the foie gras. -Corn Dog-eh, it's a corn dog. Anything fried is good, LOL! If you get drinks, just order a small as it's free refills if you dine in. And don't forget the DUCK FAT FRIES! One order is good enough to share with two people unless you LOVE ""DUCK FAT FRIES"" or bag the rest for later munchies! It's crispy, regular size length fries:) The duck flavors gets lost if you start putting Ketchup on it so alternate plain and with ketchup... If you go on their website, http://hotdougs.com/defa. You can even listen to their theme song called ""The Theme From Hot Doug's"" And yes they sell T-shirts there too. Over all, I'd say go for the experience and try the duck fat friend (Fri-Sat only!)! This way next time you see it on TV you can brag to your friends/family and say yeah I've been there:)"
1988,"No foodie can visit Chicago and not get a Chicago Dog. And there's no foodie that doesn't know who Doug is. Doug was there.The wait was not as long as I thought it would be. (Around 15 min)The Froi Gras and Duck Sausage was exactly what I thought it would be. The Chicago dog was just as I thought it would be. The fries were extra crispy. I wish they had the duck fat fries the day I was there. (only available on Fri & Sat) I need to come back to try the rest of the dogs this day. I forgot that they don't take credit cards, just cash. So keep that in mind."
1989,"While in Chicago, I only tried Hot Dogs here, and at a Cubs Game. Both were great in comparison to hot dogs the rest of America is used to.. But Hot Dougs was amazing! Cute, relaxed little restaurant, of course the only negative is the long line, but what do you expect this place has +1,000 reviews! but once you order, the food is super fast and delicious! I would definitely go to Hot Dougs If I am in Chicago again"
1990,Slightly better dog than Portillos but the specialties are worth trying.. Especially that ribeye dog..the spicy pork was really good
1991,"I think everyone knows by now the rep Hot Doug's has for being so damn good. Its high quality, easily approachable food. Its the ultimate hot dog stand for foodies. It's to be expected that the food here will be great, the lines will be long (BECAUSE the food is great), and Doug's humbleness and extremely good customer service will just add to the high points. Everyone already knows all this, though. What I REALLY enjoy about this place is the variety of menu options. They have all the regulars, but they also have some really creative options like bacon and cheese elk sausage, corned beef sausage, foie gras and duck sausage with foie gras mousse and black truffle, and get this - rattlesnake sausage with blueberry creme fraiche (just a weekly special they had when I went there last). The prices are great, too! Cash only though, come prepared. *update: recently had the ribeye sausage with chimichurri sauce. freakin good, people."
1992,"Everyone has pretty much covered it all... Why in the world did it take me so long to go here? I had heard about it for awhile, but never seemed to find myself in the area at the right time. But my god it was worth it! Waited a good 45 mins when I was there and we were only about 3/4 of the way down the building. So yeah, fast is a relative term. I suspect that people forget how long it was after they've eaten. Duck fat fries are amazing. Dogs/Sausages are worth the hype. I had a chicago dog (Just to gauge it.) and an Irish sausage with spicy jack cheese cubes and a special mustard. I bet I didn't even come close to getting the best one on the menu either. I just was so torn on what to get. I'm gonna have to get back again soon and start checking all the others off the list."
1993,This place has incredibly great service with a nice laid back mood. Doug is always behind the counter taking orders and the runners are ready to help customers find seating. I found it amazing that 2 Chicago cops actually waited in the 1 hour line in 20 degree weather instead of sauntering up to the counter. Props to them for respecting the line. I don't think I saw a single grumpy person in the place. Cased meats do bring out the best in people.
1994,"No matter when you come, you WILL wait in line for more than 45 mins. So bring some friends, and a hungry appetite for the best hot dogs you can get in Chicago ! Note: Check their website for specials and holidays. Their wild game sausages are amazing (Alligator and Kangaroo)."
1995,"Let's break this down.. 5 stars - Going on a weekday. Ordering off the basic menu (Keira Knightley oh yes). A regular Chicago dog is $1.75. How can you beat that? 4 stars - Going on Saturday and waiting 1.5 hours in line (that first dog made it down in about 8 seconds). Duck fat fries? Believe me, I looooooove duck fat, but the fries are marginally better. What they should do is give you duck fat in a dixie cup to drink with your fries. That would be better. 3 stars - Ordering any special dogs. I've tried 3, and they just aren't as good, nor are they worth the price. 1, 2 stars - Waiting outside and having fickle Chicago weather start going nuts on you."
1996,"Game of the Week: ANTELOPE...awwww yeah! i never knew a sausage could be more than a football tailgate of oscar mayer, ketchup and mustard. and yet it was. it thankfully was. who thinks to add blackberry creme fraiche, smoked gouda, or foie gras mousse as toppings? i admit, it took awhile for my tastebuds to recalibrate from the shock, but after a couple of bites i was all about these crazy delectable artery cloggers. high marks for the ""Curry Lamb Sausage with Spinach Raita and Feta Cheese"" good stuff."
1997,Best dogs I have ever eaten! There is a reason for the line that wraps around the building every day. Once inside though the service is fast and you can always find a seat since they do not let people grab tables until they have ordered. Despite it always being busy they do not rush you in ordering or in finishing your meal. A Chicago must!
1998,"Sure it's good but no hot dog is worth an hour + wait, sorry. Drive to the Vienna Beef Factory Store, Fat Johnnies or SuperDawg instead."
1999,"Hot Doug's is probably the most overhyped Hot Dog establishment in not only Chicago, but quite possibly the entire world. The outrageously large number of reviews and the two hour wait mentioned in each of them is evidence enough. However, that is to be expected when you open a hot dog place that, rather than trying to compete with thousands of other restaurants in the city for best wiener, serves various types of sausages from various different animals that you probably won't find anywhere else within driving distance. If anything, Hot Doug's is mostly just a victim of its own success at establishing a niche in the hot dog infested city of Chicago. Even if you manage to get here early, the long wait is practically inevitable. During my experience, it was pretty hard for me and my friends to fathom what could possess all of these people to wait so long (in the middle of the winter no less) for a hot dog? But make no mistake, once you overcome the long wait and encounter a surprisingly friendly Doug Sohn (who has to serve thousands of hungry customers a day), it's pretty easy to forget about the wait and get right down to business. If it's your first time, regardless of whatever else you order, you might as well order yourself a regular Chicago Hot Dog. It was good, no doubt, but why I waited in line for two hours. It is in fact the specials that everyone is coming for, ranging from the fatty duck sausage with foie gras mousse and truffle oil to the lean Rattlesnake sausage with cheese. Oh, and of course the highly famed fresh cut duck fat french fries, which were easily some of the best fries I have ever eaten. But regardless of how sensational the food is, it may be hard to justify such a long wait. Part of the reason that the wait is as big as it is is due to the relatively small location. With this much success, I would think it is time for Doug to consider expanding perhaps? All in all, you should definitely brave the wait at least once just to see what the hype is all about, but regardless, make sure you come prepared. Hot Doug's has many other odd perks besides the long wait, such as rather short opening hours, constantly changing specials, and closings on even the most minor of holidays. And of course, the duck fat fries are only served on Fridays and Saturdays for whatever reason. Thankfully, their website is updated daily with this type of information. Just don't expect things to be easy once you actually get there."
2000,"I like this place so much that I break my 2 ""I will never"" statements about buying food. I Never #1 - I will never go get cash special for a restaurant. They should take credit/debit cards. For Hot Dougs, I will ATM it without even blinking, I never #2 - I'm not going to wait in a long line for food. This is Chicago and there are too many places that have delicious food. For Hot Dougs, I break this rule except when it's below 0 and that's where I draw the line. The line moves Ok - but it's is so worth what's inside. Ok - now the inside.... it's the Mecca of encased meats. A dozen or so celebrity named sausages.... my favorite is the Marty Allen - Beef, Pork, and Garlic, Grilled....with my favorite toppings and a side of Duck fries! Damn... I've made myself hungry.... Then there's the specials - They've got a specials menu that's about as large as the regular menu, but it's headlined by a Celeb of the week, and a game of the week. The selections are amazing, and totally worth straying from your normal favorite.."
2001,"Truly ""encased meats"" has been added to a list of my favorite words thanks to Hot Doug's. Wow! Between the exotic animals going into the sausages and Friday's duck fat cooked fries. Wow! Holy Shit! Hot Doug's you have won my ever enlarging arteries over. By all means Do go here, Do experiment, and you will not be disappointed. Unless of course you suck. In which case your goddamn opinion doesn't matter anyways! P.S. don't be discouraged by the line around the block, it's a tiny lil' joint with not much seating. But tough it out, seriously, it's worth it!"
2002,"Now I haven't been to every restaurant on the planet, but even so I can say with no uncertainty that Hot Doug's is one of the very best restaurants in the entire world. There's nothing else to say, really. except I wish they were open for dinner too... alas, I shouldn't complain because I know just how lucky I am to live in the same city as this landmark in the first place. Do you eat meat? y/n? if you answered yes, then it is your duty and great privilege to eat at Hot Doug's. p.s.: Thank you, Doug, you're the man."
2003,I am a self proclaimed foodie and I have lived in Chicago my entire 31 years of existence. Shame on me for this being my first time going to Hot Doug's!! The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage was a culinary masterpeice on a bun. The flavors exploded in my mouth like a symphony. I have been in a euphoric food state since I left the restaurant. I will definitly be back to try some of the other specialty sausage and the duck fat fries.
2004,"Absolutely delicious! I was not a big fan of the duck fat fries as most people are, but this means I can avoid the famously long weekend lines and get my fix of amazing encased meats on a weekday instead. The place is small but cozy, Doug is an amazingly kind person, and the food is beyond great. Even if you end up waiting in that line, it's well worth it-- just remember to bring cash."
2005,"Everything I'm going to say has all been said before, but so be it. I'll keep it short. I hated myself for standing outside, in the rain, for an hour and a half for a hot dog.....until I tried it, and I realized how worth the wait it is. A simple hot dog and polish sausage were so delicious. The fries rendered in duck fat were out of this world. Even if you're not into tubed meat, go on the weekends and get these fries. I can't wait to go back and try some specials and game dogs."
2006,"Came here on a super hot summer morning, the line was out the door by noon. I'm not sure what time they open but I'm almost positive they close really early, 4:30-5:00pm. I saw the line and immediately told my friends that there was no way I was waiting a good block down from where the door was. They assured me that the duck fat fries would be worth the wait. After about 50 minutes of waiting in line it was our turn to order. I decided to just get a regular hotdog and try something really different, I don't know what it was but there was foie gras on it. I must say that it was delicious. Too bad they didn't have the duck fat fries, only on the weekend I believe? There's limited seating for the amount of customers they have in any given time. Totally worth the wait."
2007,"From the looks of things on this Yelp page, the last thing Hot Doug's needs is another exemplary review. Well, I just can't help myself. My kind words may be but a drop in the massive ocean of praise that Hot Doug's affords, but I really love the sound of my own voice and, perhaps even more so, I loved my experience at Hot Doug's. The wife and I were on a long weekend trip to Chicago, and when she asked me what I wanted to do I thought of two things: a game at Wrigley, and Hot Doug's. I had never known anyone to eat there, but the reverberations of their greatness had echoed all the way out to my neck of the woods through various foodie avenues. Hot Doug's was a destination to be visited, and it was at the top of my list. Access is a bit of an issue, especially for out of towners without a rental car (and a starting point in Oak Park, thanks Frank Lloyd Wright), but a $40 cab ride dropped us off in front of Hot Doug's, to take our place at the end of the massive line at 3:30 on a sweltering afternoon. We took a leap of faith that they'd serve everyone in line even once 4 came (they will, so don't worry) and waited. We saw an ambulance come and tend to one of our encased meat brethren that succumbed to dehydration, prompting the staff to (very, very kindly) water us from the garden hose so that we wouldn' t pass out, too. We even had some ice cream while we waited thanks to the very industrious Good Humor man that pulled up alongside the line (Good Humor Toasted Almond... YES!) After about an hour and a half we had made it into the doors and were face to face with Doug himself. But first you have to contend with the menu. You've got the basics: beef dog, bratwurst, polish sausage, italian sausage, andouille, Thuringer (garlicky and awesome) and so forth. You can get them topped with any variety of things, and that's all well and good. But what really sets Hot Doug's apart are ""today's specials,"" which from my gathering are every day's specials. And good for you, too, since you need to be a part of these things. On to the selections: The Sauternes duck sausage with foie gras gets a lot of pub, as well it should. This is, quite simply one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. I'm not even going to attempt to describe the taste, because I think something akin to opening the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark might happen and burn my face off. Just go there and eat it. Then smuggle another one onto a plane and fly it back to me, please. I took my first bite of my duck sausage to ""White Man in Hammersmith Palais"" by the Clash. It couldn't have been much more perfect, short of having it fed to me by a nude Brooklyn Decker. I also had the uber garlic pork smoked sausage with roasted garlic, brick cheese, and chipotle dijonnaise. Anything that allows me to eat whole cloves of roasted garlic is ok in my book. And this thing was more than ok. Very nice. My wife got the Thuringer with giardiniera (spelled that right the first time, and I'm mostly of German descent) which was good. I'd get down on a Thuringer as a go to weekend sausage on a regular basis. She also tried the celebrity dog, a crawfish/smoked pork sausage combo topped with cajun remoulade and goat cheese drizzled with honey. This was another out of this world combination that I didn't see coming. So great. And, oh yeah, duck fat french fries to go with it. This place is heaven on earth. The service is fantastic. Even though they're one of the busiest places that I've ever visited Doug could not have been nicer and took time to chat with us when we ordered. Their seating policy of grabbing a seat after you order was also great, because everyone had a place to sit and enjoy their hard earned meal. You may find yourself in line, sweating of freezing your ass off, wondering if all of this was worth it. I'm here to assure you that it most certainly is, and then some. From now until the time I visit again, or die, whichever comes first, I will think of that duck sausage, and Hot Doug's. Thanks for a truly memorable experience and I hope to visit again soon."
2008,"So to begin, my friends told me to meet them there at 10am. I thought, ""Hot dogs at 10 am? Yuck."" But I knew that this place has a line so I figured maybe we would have to wait 2 hours or something. Well, they open at 10:30 am and one of our friends got there at 9:30 to be the first person in the line. An hour later the line was a block long and the people at the end surely would wait another hour before they ordered. So, we did eat our sausages at 10:30am. Anyways, the menu changes daily. They have a list of their basic sausages which you can get anytime with the typical Chicago hot dog style condiments. Then their specialty items vary every day. We got the following: Cheese-Stuffed Chicken Chorizo with Mole a la Carlos and Queso Asadero; The Brigitte Bardot- Andouille Sausage: Mighty, mighty, mighty hot!; The Mountain Man Sausage (a damn tasty combination of Elk, Antelope, Buffalo, Venison and Caribou) with Roasted Yellow Pepper Mayonnaise and Tetilla Cheese and duck fat fries. Surprisingly, the Mountain Man was my favorite. The meat was good, not like shady hot dog meat. The Chicken Chorizo was also good. The Andouille Sausage, one of the regular sausages, was not very good, and not spicy either. I really enjoyed the other two. Their concept is that you can take three distinct ingredients and flavors and put them together in interesting, delicious combinations. The fries were ok, nothing too exciting. Despite how much it seemed like we ate, and the random assortment, it was less than totally satisfying, although the flavors were yummy. I would say that this was a fun place to try, but I wouldn't necessarily go back, unless I wanted to wait in line for an hour to eat sausage at 10:30am."
2009,The Atomic was amazing and full of flavor and heat. I also had a regular hot dog just as a baseline. That was just okay. I think the specialty dogs and sausages is where it's at.
2010,The duck fat fries was worth the hour wait in the cold after a long flight from Dallas. LOL Be prepared to wait in line on the weekends. The specials are worth the price and this is the best Chicago hot dog in town! YUM YUM!
2011,"Best Foie Gras Hot dog ever, and well worth the wait! Doug took our order and didn't rush us. Great service, great dogs, enough said, go try it for yourself!"
2012,"daddy would you like some sausage? naturally after seeing tony bourdain list this place on his top 10 i grabbed a couple friends to head on over here. since seeing his chicago episode, i've been here 5 times, and i'm ecstatic if we get in line past the dumpster outside. the food is well worth the wait, whether it's the daily specials (duck sausage with foie gras and truffle aioli NOMZ!), duck fat fries (friday and saturday only), or the staple chicago dog. without a doubt you will get a bang for your buck! just make sure you bring cash"
2013,"Just came back from Hot Dougs and after reading a lot of reviews on yelp, we expected a super long wait especially on a Saturday afternoon. We arrived at noon and ordered our food an hour later- not bad at all! We ordered five hot dogs and shared them all. My favorite was the foie gras with duck sausage- outstanding! The duck fries are addictive. Definitely coming back."
2014,"I'm conflicted. Let's just say that. This review for me is somewhere between 2.5-3 stars. Yes, I know: Stone me now all you guys who gave 5 stars. In part my rating is based on how many 5 stars this got, and my general expectations going in, vs. my actual experience. Maybe, as a reviewer said, this is THE best hot dog in Chicago. I wouldn't know, because it's true, I only eat hot dogs a few times a year. It's not my thing, and I only crave a dog when I want hugely bad-for-you food, and maybe yes, I am PMSing. But when I WANT it, I do love me a goddamn good hot dog. So there is that, as well. And I also like gourmet food. So... Maybe I am a simple girl, at heart. When I want a hot dog, I want something earthy and good and dressed down and still awesome, not dressed up. Which is why Hot Doug's confuses me. It's like Grammy night at the smorgasbord. I went in with an open mind. I thought if I had to stand in line for freakin' 50 minutes, I'd order a lot. And I thought: Foie Gras, dressed DOWN! Hot dog dressed UP! And cheese! What could be better? Simple, now, is my thinking. I had two 'special' hot dogs, and one plain. It doesn't matter what 'specials' I had--though if you want to know, my husband and I had the foie gras dog and ""the dog"" and I had the ""Fire Dog"" and the ""Selma"". But I don't think any special dog would change the review. At 9.00 a pop, the specials were *nothing* I could complain about. Really! Well, maybe the bun. (See my other reviews...I am a huge bun/dough girl.) The encased meats WERE really divine. The cheeses and sauces were also good. But, there is this: I would never brag about them, either. And at 9.00 a HOT 'DOUG', wouldn't you think I should be bragging? So here's my problem: I was still weirdly not satisfied. To large degrees. And at 9.00 a bun?! And an hour wait? This place left me thinking about word-of-mouth hype. I can't complain about it--I can't at all--but I can't at all say my heart swelled on that one of few occasions I SERIOUSLY wanted a damn hot dog. I really, really wanted to love this place. But for the price and overall 'happiness', I'd sooner skip this 'meal.' Oh, regarding service (Forgot this, and adding now): Doug is SO very nice. Really helpful, friendly. A+++++ However, after waiting in line almost an hour, and watching people bunch up at the 'end of the line', waiting for tables (there is really no room), I was very aware of who was in front of us (and should get seated first) and who was behind us (and, after a long wait, should get seated after). So the waiter dude, who wasn't paying any attention whatsoever, tried to get my husband and I to wait when we went for the 'open table' and were next in line. He swore the people behind us were ahead of us. I explained, nicely, that No, we were ahead of the other couple. and he said we weren't!!! Really? Like he was painfully waiting for an hour to be seated? It actually took the couple behind us, who this dude wanted to seat ahead of us, stepping up and saying ""REALLY, they were here first"" that we got seated. If this wouldn't have happened--the couple stepping in--and if said waiter wouldn't have seated us when we should have been seated, this would be one star. Because I don't wait forever, pay a fortune NOT to be satisfied and then on top of it be called a liar. Indirectly."
2015,delicious and a good price!
2016,"I would have to give this place 5 stars because Doug makes some of the most amazing hot dogs you will ever try anywhere! Some of the flavor combinations he comes up with at the Sausage Emporium will absolutely blow you away. You'll have to wait in line to get in and he is only open a ridiculously limited number of hours but once you get inside, you see what all the fuss is about. All of the standard dogs such as the Elvis or Keira Knightly would keep me coming back. But its his daily special menu that is really where you see his imagination at work....duck sausage with brie on top? I personally am not the biggest fan of the duckfat fries, but they are good and more of a novelty thing in my opinion. The inside of the restaurant is very fun and you feel like a kid again when you sit down to eat. Its worth a special trip."
2017,"Holy corn dog. I don't even know how to begin this with a witty thought. Because all energy that would otherwise be used to power my brain is currently focusing on digestion. When I realized that a) it would be 63 degrees in mid-February, b) I had a comp day from a working weekend and 3) I had never been to Hot Doug's, the cosmos fell into alignment. I took a half day from work, hopped on my bike andmet my fellow fat-kid friend at Roscoe and California for an hour of encased-meaty bliss. I've never even bothered to read the other 524 reviews of this place -- I'd heard enough the first time someone pounded it into my head that OMG I NEEDED TO TRY HOT DOUG's-- so at the risk of being redundant, here goes. This place brings people together: smiles all around, door holding, a nice lady telling me I dropped my ATM card on the greasy floor. I wanted to hug everyone in joyous anticipation of the dogs to come, from the businessman in a tie chowing down on his plain ol' dog to the hobo guy with no socks who kept makin' eyes at me between bites of his gyro dog with tzatziki. How Doug manages to stay in such good humor all day, every day as he takes orders from gabby, indecisive tourists is beyond me, but I'm sure it's a big part of why his shop does so well. The other part is, of course, his sausage. My goodness. Between the two of us, FFKF and I had two corn dogs, two orders of fries (one with cheese), a bratwurst and -- are you ready? -- a mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken sausage with chili-garlic mustard and Valfrais chili-paprika cheese. That was mine, copied straight from the website (they list their specials regularly so you always know what you're in for). Oh, and a Dr. Brown's CELERY soda. I wanted to marry my corn dog and have babies with everything else I ate. The lack of a fifth star was for my massively overdressed chicken dog. I had to scrape off the excess with my corn dog stick. I'm...so resourceful. And I'm not sure what else there is to say about this place. Except that it was the best $12.50 I've ever spent on encased meat. I can say that."
2018,"Hot Doug's is the BOMB! In a city known for its sausage, Hot Doug's is definitely the KING! They take the hot dog to another level - and you can have yours steamed, grilled, deep fried - I like choices, and they definitely offer you choices.... So many unique options for different types of sausage available, all garnished with the perfect condiments - DELICIOUS! Go on a weekday at an off-time, and you are sure to get in with less of a line... Doug himself is a cool guy - Kudos to him!! BEST IN THE CITY!!! Highly recommended!"
2019,A-MAZ-ING. That's all you need to know. Get here immediately. Best hot dog I've ever had... and I'm mainly a vegetarian. There are always lines so get there early.
2020,"There is a lot of hype about Hot Doug's out there and I don't like be led into an opinion by those around me. To negate this public perception I decided to turn my visit into a grueling affair, forcing Doug's to gain my appreciation only by overshadowing a terrible experience getting in. Naturally, Chicago offers this opportunity. I waited for close to an hour and a half outside of Doug's in the atmospheric physics paradox that is a 30 degree rain shower complemented by a steady 40 mph horizontal wind. After entering, I was thoroughly miserable and perfectly primed for discarding the restaurant as ""not worth the wait."" The cashier was too friendly and upbeat to possibly understand the state his thawing customers are in when they enter but he assured me I would leave sated, warm, and happy. This man knew his customers as well as Hot Doug's knows encased meats! I had a Chicago style classic as well as the weekend only duck fat fries and a rattlesnake dog and everything was fantastic! The fully loaded Chicago style was spot on and surprisingly competitively priced (I expect inflated prices at these cult institutions). The chardonnay & jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with chili garlic mayo and smoked gouda had just the right amount of heat and a unique gaminess to make it something truly special and worth the $8 price point. I also tried a bite of a companion's foie gras and duck sausage which was delicious but too rich to eat alone. The only thing that didn't live up to the hype were the duck fat fries. They were great hand-cut fries that stand above most others but didn't have the decadence that I expected. Thank goodness the weather is changing because although it is totally worth it I still won't look forward to a frigid waiting line..."
2021,they now sell souvenir t-shirts on the website. when i wear one I taste better. ask the people that lick me. fo' reals!!! walked in on a Tuesday @ 11am. No line. no wait. hot doug at the counter cheery and cool. hot server girl smiling and friendly and made me feel better about myself. such awesomeness. yay!
2022,"On a rainy Wednesday when I called in sick from work, I ended up having one of the best food experiences of my life. I woke up this morning with my body feeling like a big fat bruise. I was nauseated and achy. The cold and rainy weather reflected exactly how I felt, Shitty!!!. On this dreary day, I did something that I very rarely do. I called in sick to work. I crawled back into bed for some quiet, blissful sleep. I woke up around noon totally famished. And I was hungry for something that I swore off as a kid. I actually had a craving for a Hot Dog. You have to understand that I ate so many hot dogs as a kid, that I rarely crave them as an adult. During the summers of my youth, you could find me at one of two places. At one of my little league games, or at Wrigley Field. Needless to say, I ate so many Hot Dogs and Brats that I wanted to name my first born Frankfurter. We first did a drive by of Hot Doug's to see how long the line was. To our surprise, there was nobody waiting outside. As we entered, the line was about 10 deep. The line moved surprisingly fast. We had our food in 10 minutes. When we got to the counter, we got to meet Hot Doug himself (Doug Sohn). Doug took Carolynne's order and then asked what Derrek Sanderson would like. He obviously noticed my Boston Bruins cap. He made a great first impression by mentioning one of my favorite hockey players of all time. After talking hockey for a few minutes, he took our order. I ordered the Dave Kingman Dog and (one of the daily specials) the Mole, Smoked Chicken Sausage. The Kingman Dog was a spicy, Chicken Sausage that was packed with Flavor. The Caramelized onions were a nice touch. The Mole Chicken Sausage was out of this world. It was covered with a spicy Mole Sauce with pepper jack cheese. We also split an order of fries. Hot Doug's doesn't offer the fries made in goose oil during the week, but I can't imagine them being much better than the fries that we had. They were hand cut fries that were tender and delicious. The highlight of the meal for me was sampling some of Carolynne's Foie gras Dog. Other than the controversial ban by the City of Chicago, I had never even heard of the stuff. But the creamy liver sausage blew me away. It was a wonderful slice of decadence. I have always believed that there was a fine line between Genius and Insanity. The strange combination of sausages and toppings at Hot Doug's walks that line. I have always been amazed by how some Chefs can come up with different combinations of food that you would never even dream of. And the great ones can turn it into a delicacy. If there was a Nobel Prize for Cased Meat, Hot Doug's gets my nomination. The Bottom line is this. If you have not been to Hot Doug's, get your ass over there. What have you been waiting for? Don't worry about the line, it moves faster than you think. You will not get a better dining experience for your hard earned dollar. This place is a Gem, and a must visit for any foodie in Chicago."
2023,"Best hot dogs I've ever had! Fun decor, nice people, every hot dog combination is delicious. I like to try the ever changing specials. I'm never disappointed!"
2024,"ok first thing is first. when i signed up for yelp, i kept seeing all these reviews about hot dougs. i thought to myself, ""i must try this."" decided to go yesterday before we saw the cubbies play, (they lost :( ). i had read that sometimes the line is very long, and the wait could be up to two hours. psssf. got there at 1045. NO LINE. beat that. i had the chicago dog, and it was amazing. i cant wait to go back to have another, and try something else. the fries, were even good! (i dont like fries) they didnt even need ketchup or cheese. i also would like to go back and try the duck fries one day. but yeah. im now obsessed. and i live in the burbs. ugggggh"
2025,Wished they had better hours for the working folk
2026,"seriously good hot dogs, which isn't something that even a reluctant foodie ever expected to say. nor did i expect to be surprised by the offerings and the condiment suggestions, but i didn't imagine encased kangaroo would ever reach my face nor could i have selected a good slice of cheese to pair with it. great stuff. bonus: doug (the owner and punsake) works the counter and is friendly and funny. despite all this, i am not sure i would again spend most of an hour in the swampy july heat waiting for these things. to other doug's rookies - don't go just before cubs games!"
2027,"My colleague and I scoped this place out months in advance of attending a conference in Chicago, and it was one of our big food excursions while we were in town. When we arrived, the line was down the block, and it ended up being about an hour wait. Totally worth it, though. I had perused the menu online earlier that day, and I decided I wanted both a more gourmet dog (the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage, with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris) and a more simple Elvis dog (smoked Polish sausage). And duck fat fries, of course. It was really hard to decide, though, because so many of the menu items sounded so tantalizing. What really made this 5 stars was the service, believe it or not. When we finally arrived at the counter, I was worried that I didn't have enough cash to cover everything I wanted. I asked the guy at the counter how much it would be without the fries, because I wasn't sure if I had enough. He looked at me and said, don't be silly! Don't deprive yourself of duck fat fries just because of cash! We can work this out. I was like, um, OK, I guess I'll get the duck fat fries then. He didn't even use a cash register, he just eyeballed my order and said, eh, that looks like about $15. I'm sure it would have been more than that if he actually added it up, but I'm definitely not complaining. Later I found out that it was Doug Sohn, the owner himself. He also talked me down from a medium drink to a small since there were free refills. What a nice guy! As we sat down to eat, the staff was very friendly, asking us if there was anything we needed, taking our trash, etc. They run this place very efficiently and seem to manage the crowds well. The foie gras dog was decadent and perhaps even a little too over the top, because it was hard to taste the duck sausage what with everything else going on. But that simple smoked Polish dog was sheer perfection. I'm glad I ordered both, because it gave me the chance to try both sides of the coin (not to mention I wolfed both down so fast, if I had only gotten one I would still have been hungry, and that would have meant getting back in the hour-long line). The duck fat fries, as one might expect, were fries like no other. Despite the wait, I would come here again and again to try all the different flavors, which change frequently. I loved the great service!"
2028,Most of my reviews are overflowing with detail and description...I will tell you this I have been on a quest for the best Chicago style Hot Dog and I have found it it costs $1.75 and it is at Hot Dougs... I also tried a few of the premium dogs and guess what they were good but next time I will be sticking to the signature dog! My only complaint is location couldn't you open closer to me please?
2029,"What can I say...I love encased meats like most Americans out there! I have to say that this is probably the most unique take on a hot dog EVER! Of course, you have your original style but for the more adventurous people out there, I would recommend you trying their specialty dogs. I have to admit that I have tried all of them and haven't had a bad thing to say about any of them! My top four dogs here are the Antelope Sausage with 4 Cheese Dijonnaise & Roasted Yellow Peppers, Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Chive-Dijon Goat's Butter & Duck Rillettes,Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise, Raw Milk-Garlic Cheddar Spread and Crispy Fried Onions, and of course..Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel (by far the best Dog I ever had but it's not for everyone). Also, if you come on Friday or Saturday, you can get Duck Fat Fries that are incredible! The ambiance is very laid back and casual. You will have to wait in a long line to get inside but it is SO worth the wait! Cash only! -Papa Bear"
2030,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? I learned about Hot Doug's when I went to a cross-promotion event at the Map Room in Wicker Park, where Hot Doug's brought sausage samples to complement samples of Unibroue, a microbrew from Quebec. The evening was terrific -- I was getting smoothly plastered from tiny samples of 10% alc. beer, but somehow, my taste buds and their connections to my brain stayed sensitive enough to realize how friggin' awesome the sausage was! I went back with some friends a week later, where we mixed and matched what we liked best from the night in Wicker Park with new sausages we wanted to try. The restaurant itself is clean and kitschy, and the line (during the weekends at least, the only time I go) usually extends outside and back 50 feet. Also, the place seems to be open about five hours a week (and he's closing for two weeks to observe President's day [what?]), so while I don't have the opportunity to visit frequently, my sensory memory guides me back from time to time. This guy really has it figured out -- serve a quality product for a reasonable price, let the people flock to you from word of mouth, have the store open for minutes a week, and you've got a great gig. Try: The Thuringer, definitely (what a friend famously referred to as his ""go-to sausage"") the bratwurst and the duck fat fries."
2031,"Holy hotdogs, batman. Hot D's was amazing-- ate it for long-awaited lunch my first day back visiting beloved chicago. Five stars--fully dude. Doug was there to take our orders, and his staff's much-deserved tips as well. I had the Kiera Knightley(aka the Jeniffer Garner)-- a hotlink with everything (onions, mustard, relish, pickle, tomato, and celery salt) and effing aye it was krontastic(very good). Although i'm over Kiera and i think i should be called the Jessica Alba... But maybe it's just not spicy enough for that title, and who wants a dog that's gonna burn you... twice. All in all, YUM!"
2032,I knew it. He proposed 2/13. Thank you Hot Dougs. You're the best.
2033,Doug-open a fucking second location already.
2034,"attempt #1: closed. - - doug broke his leg. attempt #2: closed. - - closed for the holidays. ...even though it was well past christmas day. attempt #3: OPEN. halle-f*ckin-lujah. normally, i would deduct stars for being closed 2 out of the 3 times that i tried to come here, and the line out the door, but the food MORE than makes up for it. my meal: hickory-smoked cajun pork sausage with chipotle-horseradish dijonnaise and vieux brugge cheese and a side of duck fat fries. a heart attack for $9.50. but damn, i'd do it again. just the right size dog, and an abundance of fries. ...so much that my friend and i shared one order. i love the fact that doug rung me up... i wasn't sure if the fries would be enough for the both of us, so he told me to skip the line and let him know if we needed to put in another order if we needed to. (the tear in my eye after perusing all of the dogs on the menu must've tipped him off that i was a first-timer.) he was really nice even though it was super busy on a friday afternoon. i'll most definitely come back here when i visit chicago again!"
2035,"Wow... who knew hot dogs could be this amazing. The food is incredible, and I highly recommend trying some items off the gourmet hot dog menu. They wait is absolutely terrible, however. I waited for an hour and a half at 3PM."
2036,"Two dollars for a chicago dog? Can't beat that. Cash only, just avoid the lunch rush."
2037,"really? do i really have to say anything? ..... foodgasm usual order for me and the mrs: 2 foie 1 large fry 1 sm drink the small drink was actually doug's idea the very first time we went as the refills are free... i mean come on great food and suggestions to save money... win, win, win."
2038,"My mother in law was scandalized to find out that we spent $35 on six hot dogs, an order of fries and a few sodas - and waited in the cold for an hour for the privilege of doing so. Clearly she has never eaten at Hot Dougs - I considered it a bargain given the quality. And Doug himself is as nice a guy as you can find. I'll be dreaming about those duck fat fries for weeks to come. Thank god we timed our visit for the day after I had my cholesterol checked..."
2039,The hour long line that wraps around the building speaks for itself.
2040,Went with friends. On a Friday afternoon which led to a 1:30 wait but we waited it out and ordered a couple elvis's (polish sausage) and Paul kelly (brats) and some hot dogs. Also order the duck fat fries and the foie gras dog. The Foie gras was very rich and a very unique tasting dog. The polish was great and had a ton of flavor (had it char-grilled) brats where the least favorite of the group. Would go back but would def. not want to wait 1:30 again.. also keep in mind it is only open 11am-4pm
2041,"You cannot get any better than Hot Doug's when it comes to a hot dog shop. They do not cut any corners when it comes to your hot dog. From a wide range of fancy dogs, one had foie gras on it, to your simple dogs. All the dogs are cooked and prepared very well, ingredients are fresh, the duck fat fries are pretty darn good, and the service is great. Doug has mastered the art of the Dog!!!!!"
2042,"I know that I'm like the 100,000th to review this place...but it is just AWESOME FOOD. The phrase 'encased meats' takes on a whole new meaning after Hot Doug's. Too bad the fois gras dogs are now gone (was actually in the footage when Nightline did the story on that) but the food is fantastic. The line can suck...but if you go on a week day when it's not perfect weather, the line is quick...but, sadly, no duck fat fries. If you are a veggie...there are options. Remember CASH ONLY!!! And Doug is just exceptionally a cool guy!"
2043,"OK..I'm a food snob (and a good cook). Been this way for a very long time. I first discovered Hot Doug's in a small blurb in Gourmet magazine touting the duck-fat fries (old location, MANY years ago). My husband is a duck freak (anywhere anytime for any reason at all) and I'm an enabler. My particular weakness is food related nostalgia and there it was, on the list...thuringer. I hadn't had thuringer since the 60s, and I hesitated to order it because that might have soiled the divine memory, that is if it wasn't great. OK, I guess we all know it was spectacular...Recently my favorite sandwich underwent a curious name change; from the Don Rickles to....the Marty Allen. People of a certain age know who Marty Allen is - an 85 year old comic who was in his heyday at least 40 years ago. Maybe I just love the droll sense of humor....Another HUGE draw for me is selzer water on tap. It's bar none, my drink of choice. I guess I've dragged at least 20 people there over the years including my husband and 4 adult kids - as I said I'm a food snob and people take my food recommendations seriously. As far as I'm concerned, Doug does everything right. That he and only he takes only cash gives him tremendous freedom. Worth mentioning is that his staff has been incredibly stable. I remember the guy from the 1st location (others might call him a bus boy, I'll call him a ballet director) who makes that tiny room function like a precision machine . Also, tip jars are usually offensive (to me, anyway) in Starbucks type businesses, and they're way too common these days, but in this setting it is entirely appropriate - the jar is labeled ""for the people doing the actual work"". That really does keep the prices insanely low. I love the fact that Doug treats everyone well. I must admit, I have felt a bit foolish standing outside in 10 degree weather, but for every reason previously stated, I will continue to do so - but hope that the weather will let up a bit when the crew gets back from their latest well-deserved vacation. As Dr. Suess taught me in his only non-rhyming book, The King's Stilts, ""when you work, you really work, and when you play, really play"" Have a great time guys!"
2044,"I went to Hot Doug's today for lunch and as always it was fabulous. I had the bison sausage and the smoked portuguese linguica, both were great!! money well spent"
2045,Don't even think about NOT coming here.
2046,"I was here for my second time. Nothing new to report, only that on the day before Christmas I had a B-List celebrity sighting of Patton Oswalt there. He was even nice enough to take pictures with some people. The best part was where Ryan L. and I made Michael G. sit right next to him since he was the last to sit down."
2047,"I work down the street and am amused by the long line that I see, rain or shine. I guess it's worth the wait for many, but if you really want to make it worth it, gather a group and call in your order (at least $20 worth) to pick it up without waiting in line. There's always friendly service and the mood is usually upbeat - it's hard to miss with the close quarters everyone sits in and the loud music."
2048,"If you don't like Hot Doug's, you're an infidel. And I will come to your domicile and punch you repeatedly in your buns, mocking your cruddy, cruddy taste. Then I will eat a delicious antelope sausage and throw my napkin on your bruised, humiliated body."
2049,"Ah Hot Doug's. What can I say that hasn't already been said? For one thing, I'll give you a secret worth it's weight in gold...call in your order! Yes, I know it seems revolutionary but if you pick up the phone and talk to Doug directly you will be able to bypass the line and pick up your order in 10-15 minutes tops. Even on the busiest days. Want another tip? My favorite dog is the Bratwurst with sauerkraut and brown mustard. The fries are also good and come in generous portions. Yay for Hot Doug's!"
2050,"Even though it was pretty good, after all the hype, I expected more. The regular dog is nothing better than others I've had in Chicago. The special dogs are good, but not worth a two hour wait in the July heat. The duckfat fries tasted like regular fries to me."
2051,"Damn good dogs!!!!! unbelievable service. I'm in on this band wagon! The Duck fat french fries yum but this place is definitely about the meat! The most creative dogs on the planet. The Tuben, think Ruben in a hot dog form. The duck meat dog with foie gras on top and black truffle mustard. They will prepare a regular old hot dog any way you like it. This place has so many choices you will have to go back a few times to try everything and then realize they've created a new dog.... I just wish they were open longer and on Sundays. closing at 4 pm hurts....especially when the craving hits you. Best place for creative and extremely delicious hot dogs."
2052,"One of the top dog joints in Chicago, 'nuff said! This guy has such a large variety of dogs and sausages, not to mention a couple different ways to cook 'em, I haven't had a chance to indulge in everything on the menu. If you are a hot dog lover who needs a little spunk added to the addiction, check this place out. He even has rattle snake sausages, so I can assure you he will surely have something that tickles your fancy."
2053,"Once again, Hot Dougs does not fail to deliver. After almost a month of waiting I FINALLY got to satiate my hunger for some encased meats. Why a month? The last time I went was my birthday and was unable to return since, because of my work schedule. Fridays are the only time Im able to go, so when I have the opportunity, I take it! Especially on a day when its 78 degrees out!? What more of an excuse do you need to trek out there! As usual, I approach the line which moved fairly quickly this time around. After biding my time for the usual 20/30 mins (I got in line about 245 pm, at the counter by 315pm) I stepped up to order. Duck fat fries are a must on a Fri/Sat, since thats the only time its available. Next on the agenda, the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage! My guilty pleasure and addiction, a must try at Hot Dougs. And since I always get 2 specialty dogs, I opted on the game of the week, buffalo sausage. Topped w chipotle dijonnaise and smoked gouda cheese! If that order doesnt make youre mouth salivate, I dont know what will. Eagerly awaiting, my food finally arrives, diving headfirst into the fries before moving onto the buffalo sausage...intense flavor profile, simply put a flavor explosion with every bite! The foie gras sausage needs no intro, any fan of this delight already knows words cannot even begin to describe the deliciousness. My buddy that accompanied me ordered the beef and lamb gyro dog which I sampled. I must say, it surprised me. I think it was missing something, perhaps the tsatziki sauce and onions? overally though, it was tasty. Hot Dougs, I am forever a loyal customer, Im glad such a place exists! And again I cant stress this enough, BRING CASH! The couple behind us were shocked and the poor guy had to sprint to the nearest ATM like Tyson Gay in the Olympics, but he made it! No plastic accepted. Also, if youre in line BEFORE 4PM, you are granted entry. If its 4PM and youre not already in line, dont bother getting out the car. Ill save you the disappointment and walk of shame. Bring cash, be early, and depending on flow of traffic, be prepared to wait."
2054,"It seems cliched to review a restaurant that is so widely adored in the Chicago-land area. I would come off as crazy if I mentioned how I once waited an hour and a half in 20 degree weather for a sausage and fries. Could I convince the masses that every potato aspires to become a buttery flavored french fry deep fried in succulent duck fat? Or that Doug's rib-eye sausage decorated with fontina cheese and garlic aioli would make any steak lover stand up and salute him. Even Doug himself, with his bright smile and his always changing rotation of trendy glasses is endearing. Hot Doug's will hopefully be around for many more years to come, one can only hope he'll take his little piece of heaven and make room for just a few more fans."
2055,"the best there is and the best gourmet. They change up the menu a bit, so u dont get tired of the same old thing."
2056,"Jeers to Hot Doug's for being closed promptly at 4pm on a warm summer day. They're open from 10am-4pm, apparently. Of course, I arrived twenty minutes too late. WTF? Seems like a strange choice to be closed at 4pm-- I would think they'd get quite a bit of business, at 4:20, and for the late night crowd. So, I was not able to have a taste of this lovely Chicago delicacy-- and doubt that I will return, unless I just happen to be in the neighborhood."
2057,How else do I say it? AMAZING This place is fantastic!
2058,"I seriously wonder if people are responding much more positively to a place like this, to reduce dissonance when they have to do things like wait over an hour for a hot dog and fries. I'm not of that ilk. This place is pretty good and nothing more than that. The duck fat fries are not all they are hyped up to be, unfortunately. The gourmet dogs are good, though borderline overpriced, while the standard selection does not stand out like I hoped it would. A solid 3 stars...but 4 or 5? No way."
2059,"Love this place. Totally worth it, despite the line. Went again today. So yummy. Definitely get the duck sausage. Also, I moved to Chicago from Madison, WI and Doug's has the best beer brat I've ever had. Very creative and very delicious food!"
2060,They are amazing. Go at opening to avoid an obnoxious line.
2061,"Most creative and well developed meal you may find in the city. Good surroundings, great music, and Doug is just damn cool. Well worth the wait."
2062,"Totally worth the hype. I saw this on Bourdain and had to come when we went on vacation in Chicago. We got there at 10:15am, and there was already a line outside the building waiting for the place to open. I got the duck sausage with foie gras and a traditional dog with everything on it, my wife got an italian sausage. Oh, man, and some duck fat fries. If I lived in chicago, I'd come here every morning and try something different. My one regret is that I couldn't eat any more. I really wanted to try the steak sausage with horseradish mayo, the lamb sausage, etc. Living in LA, there's no place that I can get sausage like this. Next time I go to chicago, I am for sure coming back."
2063,"I wasn't terribly impressed with Hot Doug's, despite all the hype that I'd heard. I went on a Friday and got the famous ""duck fat fries,"" and could not tell the difference between between regular fries and those, except for the fact they cost twice as much. My sausage was good, I think I got some kind of chicken, but it wasn't mind-blowing. Of course, I'm vegan now, and won't really need to visit again, unless I decide to try their veggie dog ... Doug is friendly, and waiting in line for a place is always kind of fun if the weather's nice -- builds anticipation. Too bad it was such a let down by the time we got to our table."
2064,"We went on Saturday and had the duck fat fries, which are amazing! I also had the smoked yak sausage and the Paul Kelly, they were great! The wait was just over an hour, we didn't get there until about 1:30 though. It is hard to get to the place and a bit pricey if you take a taxi, but its 100% worth it! This place is CASH ONLY, so make sure you have cash."
2065,"Great place to get a diff menu of ""dogs"" every time. I tried three diff dogs today: spicy thai chicken sausage, jack daniels sausage, and jamaican jerk pork sausage....topped with cheesy fries. YUM! I will def be going back to see what's on the menu next time! The wait is long but well worth it."
2066,"When biting into a encased meat it must pop. Doug's dogs do that. Not only in original flavors but in interesting ones as well. I settled for the toulose dog with pate, french mustard, and a soft cheese topping it. My only regret was not being here on a Friday or Saturday to taste the duck fat fries."
2067,"Back to Doug's again, this time met a pretty fast moving line. Had a veg dog with the Cherry-Blackberry Cream Sauce and Sartori Raspberry Cheese topping. Shared the vinegar tots with my friends. We were in and out with a quickness. Perfect lunch with an added gourmet topping touch! Can you say delish?!?!"
2068,"Hot Doug's is a Chicago-based restaurant, specializing in hot dogs and other encased meats. The self-proclaimed ""Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium"" is in its second location at 3324 North California Avenue in the city's Avondale neighborhood. Its first location, on Roscoe Street, closed after a 2004 fire. After being coaxed away from my computer by my instinct to be not-thin, and persuasion from a friend... it was off to Hot Doug's. The first thing you should know about going here is, go with a friend, for several reasons; although I have come up with 3 essentials: -LONG LINES Doug's is only open from 10:30am till 4pm Monday - Saturday so anticipate a wait; and you might as well have someone to talk to. -CASH ONLY Doug's is cash only so if you only have a card or are a little short, it's nice to have a friend near-by to mooch off of. -SHARING The more people you bring the more you can order split into pieces and try a bit of everything. Trust me I don't like to share my food, but I gladly do here! My friend said, ""let's do 5 today,"" but we finally settled on 4. The first one which I thought was a easy choice was the Celebrity Sausage (sausage named after a celeb that changes daily or so... I think?) Which was the Bridget Moynahan today which if you don't know who she is, she was in Coyote Ugly, Serendipity (a la John Cusack) and I know her best from a short lived ABC series called 6 degrees, which I actually liked but wasn't a stupid fucking reality show so I think almost made it only one full season? But this was the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage finished a with sriracha mustard and topped with a sesame seaweed salad. -$7.50 Lastly we dug into the ""big dog"" One-Third Pound Calabrese Pork Sausage with Creamy-Sun-Dried Tomato Mustard, Spicy Tapenade and Tallegio Cheese. -$8.00 Wow, the only way to describe this is a big spicy, rich, awesome kick to the mouth! The decision to have four dogs was justified at first bite of this one and passing on Doug's fresh cut french fries I learned is the way to do it. My first bite sent my brain into a utter state of confusion; the warm soft bun surrounding the perfectly cooked chicken sausage which must have been made with fennel or some pepper flake that gave it a holy shit spicy kick but was definitely set off by the sriracha mustard but was at the same time cooled by the seaweed salad which hit my nose at the same time sending my palate into a state of dislocation of if I was at a Hot Dog joint or Asian Restaurant. Regardless this was AWESOME! Quickly moving on to the next one was the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Creme Fraiche and Roasted Almonds. -$7.50 Ok, so I'm pretty sure the only time I've ever had nuts on my sausage is when I've sat down too fast in gym shorts? I wasn't sure what to think of this by looking at it, but at first bite, I was gay for this sausage! The way the roasted almonds complimented every bite and the creme fraiche rounded this dish out; it's a marriage in Massachusetts! The next one was a Portabella Mushroom and Swiss Cheese Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijionaise, Caraway Havarti Cheese and Shiitake Mushrooms sauteed in duck fat. -$8.00 Hard to write about this one because I'm pretty sure I made this sausage look like Harry Houdini and disappeared before my very eyes. All I have to say is look at the description, oh yeah and two words, DUCK FAT! Although, I have yet to go on a Friday or Saturday when the fries are cooked in DUCK FAT! But my personal fatitude is when you have the option, stick to meat! My first time I definitely had to try the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel -$9.00 which is one of the dishes that has brought owner Doug Sohn much controversy and notoriety due the recent ban and repeal of fois gras; but I learned the hard way by eating the whole thing, another dog and large fries by yourself is a recipe for stomach holding and food coma...but delicious! Other than hot dogs and encased meats, I think Doug's specializes in thinking outside the box (or bun to steal a phrase from my beloved Taco Bell.) I could go on about the place but I think you should try it for yourself this is definitely on my list of favorites. ...Move over Abe Froman, Doug Sohn is the Sausage King of Chicago!"
2069,"We had: - Swiss Cheese Smoked Pork Knockwurst with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Vintage Van Gogh Cheese. - Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. - And instead of fries (since we were not there on the right day to have the duck fat fries), 'The Dog'. Hot dogs are a lot like bacon in two ways: 1) eat enough and you'll probably die nice and early and 2) they'll probably taste good with anything. Whether your topping be duck fat, jalapeno peppers, or peanut butter - if you're putting it on a hot dog you're in for a treat. With that said, Hot Doug's truly offers some creative concoctions. What's really striking is the lack of commonality between their various menu items. It would be one thing to have a number of toppings and a number of encased meats and see how many ways you can pair them. Say for example you had 5 toppings to choose from and 3 meats to offer. That would allow for 96 different choices a customer could possibly make when designing their dog. Imagine the possibilities! While this would make excellent fodder for an SAT question - it wouldn't show the true genius that is at work at Hot Doug's. Doug, it seems, puts a lot of thought into his menu. Each item is not merely meat with some toppings piled on, but instead is a concept - a work of art even. Even better, it's not a piece of art you need to take a step back from, tilt your head and pretend you know what the random splashes of paint on the canvas stand for. Instead, each menu item is a masterpiece that leaves little for interpretation - they stand alone and speak for themselves. Another impressive feature of this place is the fact that Doug works the counter himself and takes time to talk to all of his customers. And while half of the dialog seems to be the customers piling layers of praises upon Doug - the other half is Doug humbly downplaying all of the compliments and idolizing. If this unusual level of modesty isn't readily observable through some subtle eavesdropping - just take a look at the walls of Hot Doug's. For all of the press - the newspaper articles, the visits from the Travel Channel and Food Network, and all of the celebrities that have no doubt visited - you will not find any evidence of all the media attention prominently displayed anywhere on the walls. Instead , the interiors appear to serve as a shrine to two kings - the hot dog and Elvis. Yes - the line for Hot Doug's can get long. We made it a point to arrive 20 minutes before opening and were the first into the joint. By the time we finished our meal, the line easily wrapped around the building. As I suggest in my other reviews, the food will taste good whether you eat it at 10:30AM or 10:30PM. If you value your time, and can think of a few other things you rather do with it than wait in line, go early and be rewarded."
2070,If I lived next to Hot Doug's I'd need an angioplasty by years end. This place is the reason I love living in Chicago. Doug's visionary encased meats can't be beat. Loved it so much I bought a shirt and wear it with pride.
2071,over two hours wait for this place? a place that only serves hot dogs? not any hot dogs but exotic ones... from all types of wild animals shoved into a casing...with some crazy toppings? was it worth it? yeah it sure was... this place is pretty well known in Chicago and now their popularity (so has their lines) has doubled cause of Anthony Bourdain... fill ya pie hole up with duck fat fries on friday and saturday only and go with anything on their menu . . . its disgustingly good!
2072,"Lamb with mint and garlic, topped with feta cheese and a flavored mustard. Linguica (Portuguese chorizo) with saffron mustard and manchego cheese. Sweet, sweet heaven. The Chicago-style dog is as good a one as you'll find. Words fail to express the glory of duck-fat fries. I bow to you, Doug."
2073,"I miss working in the city, we used to call ahead to order a huge amount of food and race back to work to eat. It was a Friday tradition. But alas the economy went south and I've been banished to work in Lake County (fuck Lake County!) and Hot Doug's doesn't do phone ahead orders on Saturdays. I am now stuck standing in line with everyone else. Damn you stupid economy you've robbed me of Hot Doug Fridays!!!!"
2074,"Must say, I was not impressed by the actual hot dog.The menu is awesome and ever changing. The service is great. The owner dude is extremely friendly and personal with you. But the hot dogs were just not that impressive. There are many places out there that will taste EXACTLY the same. Also, they only take cash!"
2075,"I LOVE hotdogs and when I went to Chicago, I HAD to try this place. I think I saw them featured on FoodNetwork or Travel Channel as one of the best hotdog places in Chicago. So we went a little before noon & there was already a long line, parking was difficult, we parked like 2 blocks away on the street. I think I ordered a regular Chicago dog, drink, and fries that were cooked in duck fat (YUM!). It was good. They have a good selection of hotdogs made with all types of different meats. The food was good but the place was so packed that we had to wait (10 mins)for someone to leave so we could get a table & eat our food. Definitely was worth the wait (about 30-45 mins) & every hotdog lover should try this place least once"
2076,"Having moved away from the homeland, and while yelping about some good food in SD, I started day dreaming about Doug... don't let the glasses fool you, that man has a vision, a vision of encased meat, topped in hedonistic fantasy; he never serves up a miss. Never have I seen so many rmoulades on so many species, with so many cheeses. Doug, what are your drams like? Even if you don't love kitsch hot dog paraphernalia, if you are willing to eat meat, eat Hot Dougs, there is no better sausage. If you go on a weekend, bring a book."
2077,I can't remember which dogs I had (friends picked up the food) but they were really delicious!! Not too impressed with their duck fat fries as it tasted pretty much just like regular fries to me with no trace of duck.
2078,"I thought NOTHING could top Crif Dogs until NOW... Like Calumet, this place was also featured on Bourdain's 'No Reservations'. I have been dreaming of the foie dog since that episode, but to no avail on my first attempt. It was roughly 12pm on a Good Friday and the line wrapped around the block as we drove by. Not a chance in hell we were going to wait. Saturday rolls around and we think our chances are better since it's a rainy day. We are right to some extent. Only 1hr wait, roughly 30 people in front of us at 11am. As you enter, you have the standard menu, then Today's Specials to the left of that. Newest addition to the hotdog family, featured on the Celebrity Sausage chalkboard is the Jamie Jungers, a cherry pork sausage w/ pomegranate creme fraiche & snow white cheese, a Tiger Woods allusion. Doug, with his beaty eyes and black rimmed glasses in tow, mans the register and order counter. It's only then that you get the option of sitting, but many opt for take out. The walls are brimming with primary colors (red, blue, yellow). The back wall has silver glitter that reinforces their mantra, 'There are no finer words in the English language than, 'encased meats,' my friend. Well said, so well said that it's also imprinted on the back of their tees, which I then HAD to get. I'll let the hotdogs speak for themselves sans my usual comments, since this is one of those experiences that you HAVE to see/taste for yourself. Let's just say that the foie topping was generous and your eyes will roll to the back of your head, CRACKTACULAR!. Well worth the 9 bucks! The duck fat fries are similarly awesome, with skin on. After your visit, there will be no wonder why there are over 1000 reviews with a 4.5 avg yelp star rating. Customer demographic is college kids, with the occassional die hard junk food lover on line. You won't see Granny or Mr. Fancypants lining up. THE GOOD -Flavors were symphonic -Quality ingredients THE BAD -Long waits -No menus posted/handed out while waiting on line THE UGLY -Doug Ordered: -Cranberry shiraz wild boar sausage ($6.50) [w/ sweet curry mustard & grand canaria cheese] -Foie Gras & sauternes duck sausage ($9) [w/ truffle aioli, foie gras & fleur de sel] -Duck Fat Fries ($3.50) -Hot Doug's tee ($15) Total came out to $34 after everything Pics: http://www.meetup.com/fo"
2079,"Hot Doug's is my favorite hot dog place. The restaurant is nice and colorful, complete with many hot dog and hot dog related pictures and the menu is very creative. My favorite thing to get there is the andouille sausage, who's name varies from time to time, but is formerly named the Madonna. All fountain drinks have free refills. The most amazing things on the menu are the duck fat fries, available only on the weekends, that are extremely fatty and delicious and best covered in hot cheese. It's some good shit. :)"
2080,"For lunch today I made the trek all the way up north to Hot Doug's to meet Jeff. We just missed the lunch rush, so I had that going for me.... which is nice. I ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, the Gyro Sausage, The Dog, Fries, and a small Fountain Beverage. Can Doug be any nicer? You'd think that after slinging that many sausages for so many years to so many customers, he'd be a total prick. On this occasion I allowed him to pick my final sausage and he totally took some time and thought about it (he suggested the gyro). Anyway, after much internal debate, I decided to eat the sausages one at a time and started with the duck. First off the sausage itself was moist, well seasoned, and just straight up yummy. However, the yumminess didn't stop at the sausage, because it was topped with Foie Gras Mousse and Truffle Sauce. Wow! This was more than a sausage, it was a well orchestrated gourmet meal disguised as a sausage and delivered on a bun. I then moved to the Gyro, which wasn't so much a play on a traditional Gyro, but more a Mediterranean inspired dish on a bun. The sausage was comprised of lamb & beef, topped with a Spinach Riata, Black Olives, and Haloumi Cheese. Another winner! Finally, I dove straight into a classic Chicago dog. Doug keeps it real with a nice all beef dog, drags it through the garden, and leaves off the ketchup. It was delicious, but the bun wasn't steamed, which is a bit of a turn off for me. The fries were spot on and the Root Beer was flowing freely from the tap. The space looks like just another hot dog shop. Bright colors, plenty of seating, and walk up service really makes you feel like you're at the corner greasy spoon. However, excellent service, great tunes, and an amazing product elevate Hot Doug's to be something so much more. If Charlie Trotter was really nice, cool, was obsessed with sausages, and down to earth he might have opened a joint like this, but he's not and Doug is. I hate dishing out 4 or 5 star Yelps for fast food joints, especially when I only gave White Castle a 3, but this is just straight up sinful and delicious! 2 Sausages of the Day 1 Hot Dog 1 Fry 1 Drink ------------ $21.00"
2081,"Still amazing. I've recently tried some amazing specialty hot dogs that everyone should try. The merlot and blueberry infused venison with raspberry cheese on top, the rib eye with crispy onions on top, and the buffalo sausage with serendipity cheese are some of my favorites there. The duck fat fries of course are a must if you go on fridays and saturdays."
2082,"What hasn't been said? Arrived at around 10:15am on a weekday morning and joined the handful of people hiding in their cars. Not much of a wait, even for my second round at 11am after a quick drive to the ATM down the street (CASH ONLY!). Four dogs and a cheesy fries later, I was ready to pass out on the floor. Foie gras and duck sausage was definitely the highlight. Not a big fan of the chicken sausage (kind of bland), but the ribeye sausage was awesome. Sure, it came out to a $40 meal for two, but I'll definitely be returning for future encased meat brunches."
2083,"When you have over 2,000 independently owned hot dog stands in the city of Chicago, it may seem silly to travel out of the way and stand in line for an hour just to try another hot dog. However, Hot Doug's turns out more than just another hot dog--this is a ""Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium!"" From your simple Chicago Dog to a truffle-infused chicken sausage, you can't really make a wrong decision here. I have even tried the Vegetarian dog, and for a place that specializes in meats, even the veggie option left me satisfied. Conclusion: Go to Hot Doug's and use the time spent waiting in line to make up your mind between whether you want an Alligator, Snake, or Foie Gras dog--or maybe you should get all three..."
2084,Worth the over-hour wait? Yes. Well priced. The basic hot dog was one of the best I have had. But the duck fat fries were some of the best fries I have ever had. Oh man. Now I really wanna go back to try some of their special dogs. And get more of those fries. Oh man........
2085,"Excellent. I had never heard of this place, but as a Chicagoan and a carnivore, i am ashamed i havent and i will be returning soon. I had a Don Rickles which was so tasty and cooked so perfectly i barely had to bite it. The guy who takes the orders was funny, nice and generally a good dude i think. The staff was nice, it was clean, i am going to try everything on the menu. Good spot."
2086,"True thing about the long lines...but I've only gone on weekends during lunch hour. I've only actually waited once for it which was the first time I went because my fiance raves about that place. I got the andouille that time but it was only pretty good. It wasn't worth the wait. For some reason he didn't order me the special meats which are more expensive: about 6-8 bucks (this includes tax) for one of them. But go for the specials if you want the good stuff. The others are just normal any good hot dog stand type stuff in terms of their quality. I've tried the special meats a few times already. The wild boar or pork sausages are quite good. Yesterday, a Wednesday in April 07, the line wasn't out the door but there were about 5 people ahead of me so the wait wasn't too long. I tried the Luol Deng (Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Green Apple Cream Sauce and Smoked Almonds...this was really good by the way.) and the Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Harlech Horseradish Cheese was good too. I think out of the two I liked the Luol Deng more because the horseradish cheese on top stuck to my teeth too much (i rate food on texture a lot). Who knew smoked almonds and green apple cream sauce would go well on a sausage. It was a little sweet but not too sweet. I really enjoyed that one. I'm just sad that it costs so much to get two of the specials but for me to be full I need both of them. I usually get two hot dogs if I go to other hot dog stands to get full. I didn't have enough money for fries but it's okay since I was full. I spent about 13 bucks for those two and free ice water. Duck fat fries are delicious but you can only get it on Fridays and Saturdays. Oh and cash only!! Hopefully they allow credit cards soon. The seats are usually pretty much filled up. Oh and they close early like 4pm, fyi. They get quite good business even though they have short hours. The owner, Doug, is smart and pretty well off I think. He's also really nice, he's the one taking orders behind the counter. Make sure they're open before you go too. Their website updates daily or weekly? Street parking is possible. Usually it isn't hard nor takes longer than 5 minutes to find. But a lot of people carpool too."
2087,"I just want to attest to the vegetarian good times that can be had here. comely, cheerful staff Doug Sohn's booming belly laugh fuckin' dijonnaise"
2088,"With so many hot dog places in this city you have to ask yourself what is so great about Hot Doug's? Well for starters how about duck fat french fries, or frio gras on a cognac infused pheasant sausage with black truffle mustard? This place has it all, from more traditional Chicago style hot dogs to the more exotic. The first time I ate there was on a Tuesday and I ate there two more times that week because it was so good. I can't say enough about this place, the line my be out the door but it is worth the wait, this place is unbelievable."
2089,I ADORE this place! Yes there's a line and usually a wait and yes the space is on the small side but the dogs are monumentally good! I had no idea that something as simple as a hot dog coud have so many thoughtful variations. I love coming here and going out of my comfort zone trying venison hot dogs and unusual sauces. In my opinion this place is a fun destination for a food experience. Plus if you are friendly you can meet some really fun people in the line and the wait seems less painful.
2090,"THE BEST HOT DOGS! I love a good Chicago style dog as much as the next person, but Hot Doug's takes it to a whole new level. What makes this place really incredible is the amazing encased meats. There is wild game, exotic fare, delectable fillers which culminate in an amazing flavor sensation. The place is always packed and with good reason...check it out right away!"
2091,"The 45 minute wait was well worth it! We were ready with our selections by checking the website while standing in line. Got the duck sausage, uber garlic, elk sausage and the sonoran. The kids got the corn dogs. I thought eating 4 hotdogs was more than what I and my husband can handle but boy, I was mistaken! The hubby and I shared the hotdogs and they were more than enough! They only accept cash which is better for us. So far, it does not compare to any other hot dog places that we've been to."
2092,"PS: I have decided that if ever a guy I'm dating doesn't like Hot Doug's, it's a deal-breaker & I will have to break up with him on the spot."
2093,"Used to be a fan until Frank n Dawgs came along. No lines, much tastier and more creative."
2094,"I cannot say enough good things about Hot Doug's. I started going here before I ever even moved to Chicago. Every time I visited my sister, I insisted that we eat at Hot Doug's. The food is really good (especially the duck fat fries on Fri and Sat) and really inexpensive. And Hot Doug himself is great. He is so friendly (the guy in line after me was short like 50 cents, and Doug didn't even care. I know that's not a big deal, but it was still nice to see.)"
2095,"I almost felt ashamed being this pleasured by hot dogs. Seriously, I feel like heaven is lined with duck fat fries and phesant and other awesomely delicious animals."
2096,I have dreams about their corn dogs. I have dreams about Hot Doug's. Try going on a weekday when the weather is death-defyingly cold and arrive a bit before they open. Prepare for hot dog dreams.
2097,"Love Hot Doug's!!! It's simple: Bring cash. Prepare for lines. Always check the specials. Be respectful of seating. Enjoy!!! This establishment is one of those rare experiences that's worth the trip and time. You will not be disappointed. I repeat, you WILL NOT be disappointed. We tried the following: The Frankie ""Five Angels"" Pentangeli Italian Sausage, The Elvis Polish Sausage (both with everything), The Sauternes Duck Sausage w/Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras mousse and Sel Gris, & The Blueberry-Infused Venison Sausage w/raspberry mustard. Oh, and Duck Fat French Fries. Yes, my Law...YES! Did I mention that I LOVE Hot Doug's?? If you live in Chicago and haven't gone...go. If you visit Chicago, don't waste your time with Navy Pier...go to Hot Doug's and have a true Chicago experience."
2098,"Stop #4 on the tour and the best so far! The variety of dogs and sausages is amazing. And I love that you can choose how you want your dog/sausage cooked. Also, for someone who has vegetarians in her family, this is a great option, cuz they can have the veggie dog! My husband and I each had two dogs, one steamed and one char-grilled. Both were great! And even with that and splitting a large fry, I didn't feel overly full. Fries were great, by the way. Granted I was quite hungry. Also, we sat outside (which was in the cleanest alley I have ever seen...great use of space) and when we ordered large drinks, he charged us fro small drinks since they have free refills and figured we wouldn't want to come back in. So nice! Overall, this place is worth the wait. Because as I have learned over the past few weeks, not all Chicago hot dogs are created equal."
2099,"This is a top-tier Chicago restaurant, there is no doubt about it. The lines are ridiculous, but they are that way because the menu is absolutely unique, uncannily delicious, forever metamorphosing, and not very expensive. Just look at some of the current and past menu items and you will realize that this is a special place: Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Caraway Havarti Cheese Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Chive-Dijon Goat's Butter and Duck Rillettes Rattlesnake Sausage with Smoked Gouda and some sort of nut that I can't remember right now As a seasoned veteran of this place, I know a few secrets which I will share with you now. You're Welcome. 1) If you get there at 10:30-11 on a weekday, the line is relatively short. Like 5-10 minutes short. 2) If it is a weekday and you are ordering more than 25$ worth of food, you can call your order in and pick it up, thus avoiding any line. Yes, you will receive the ire and burning wrathful stares of the hundred or so people you walk past going straight to the counter and picking up your food, but it's worth it. 25$ is probably more than a normal person's order, but I usually always clear 25$ because I have a problem. 3) The specialty sausages are honestly why you are here, why you waited in line, and why Hot Dougs is Hot Dougs. The choices rotate frequently, so if you see something delicious sounding, you should get it, it may not be there for long. I recommend always getting at least 2 sausages, trust me you won't regret it. Also, if you finally get to the front of the line, order 1 regular hot dog with nothing on it (I've seen this done before), you are doing it wrong! 4) The Duck Fat Fries are also amazing, only offered on Friday and Saturday, which adds significant wait time and why Doug does not allow aforementioned tip #2 of calling in your order. They are a specialty which I love, bring a book. 5) The tip jar is not just there to look at people. 6) If you get a tattoo of the Hot Doug's logo, you get free Hot Doug's for life. This is true, ask Doug yourself when you go there. When I think about all the times I've been here and all the fabulous encased meat varieties I've tried, it's really quite impressive that Doug can still come up with new menu items that still satisfy just as much as his previous masterpieces. Thankfully Doug seems to really love doing this, and I am glad to have known his work. A true sausage genius!"
2100,"The place is cool, the dogs are very good, I had the Don Rickles, it was awesome, and I had a corn dog just because I hadn't had a corn dog since I was a kid and it was a good corn dog. I wasn't a fan of the duck fat fries, to each their own, I prefer the fries over at Burger Baron."
2101,"I've been a hot dog fan for years and was happy to find Hot Doug's on California. Not actually on your way type of place, but worth the drive since it's the only place in Chicago and one of the only places anywhere to enjoy unusual sausage combination like hot dogs made from lamb or ones with truffle oil! The fries are deadly good. And as far as the brilliant classically trained Doug, kudos for finding a restaurant job with good hours! You go guy."
2102,"I obviously never thought hot dogs could be all that hot doug's makes them be. More importantly, I never thought a restaurant would so baffle me by its efficiency and creativity and despite its obvious popularity, utter lack of pretension, exceptionally friendly service, and completely reasonable prices."
2103,"SO SO GOOD! What is there to say that hasn't been said already. I have the fois gras dog which was indescribably tasty. I heard a couple behind me complaining about price and yes $9 bucks for a hotdog may seem a little hefty, but its not in this case.Don't let your self being fooled into thinking all dogs are created equal, the encased creations are beautiful gourmet meals served in a convenient bun. Also if you want to go more traditional they do have a Chicago Dog for less than $2 bucks which is also mighty tasty."
2104,"Whether you chow one of the weekly specials (alligator, duck or smoked anything) or order from the regular menu (say a Don Rickles with raw onions, kraut and honey mustard), the only way the H.D.'s experience could be improved upon would be an addition of a green room with hammocks for after the debauch. Lordy, considering the amount of dinero I've dropped in this joint, Mr. Sohn should name a wing of his mansion in my honor. And in a perfect world, H.D. would already have an internationally observed holiday named in his honor."
2105,There is no better meal in the city....make sure to go on Friday or Saturday for the duck fat fries..I would check online at http://HotDougs.com to see what the weekly specials are....there is nothing like the tueben which is a corned beef sausage. My personal favorite was the Cranberry infused Buffalo meat sausage.
2106,This place is worth standing out in the cold for over an hour. Few places are. You'll make new friends. Enough said.
2107,"Pros: - friendly service, Doug is awesome! - kitschy but cute interior that is spotlessly clean - unique encased meat flavor combinations with inventive toppings, their game of the week seems to reliably hit it out of the park Cons: - the line can get long; I came at 10:00 a.m. on my off day and was first in line, but before it opened at 10:30 there were already 10 other people behind me - cash only - be aware before you go and line up - YMMV in terms of value for price; Doug's encased meats are good, but for 3 out of the 4 specials I ordered, I found myself wishing that I had spent the money at a comparable establishment in the same price range elsewhere instead (e.g. Xoco) - this may depend on your palate's inclinations Summary: order the specials and you'll almost forget your eating ""just"" a hot dog; come early or at an off time to avoid the worst lines."
2108,"This is one of those places that I have heard a lot about but didn't ever go to, I thought it was a Chicago novelty kind of like Chicago style pizza...I want to tell you my friends (Hot Doug's lingo) that I was wrong. If my heart could handle this, I would eat here every single day, it is that good. They have unique sausage items that you can't get anywhere else in the city, like Elk, buffalo, etc. and for people who don't like to try new things...yes, they have the Chicago style hot dog. Finish everything off with some fries cooked in duck fat (available on Friday and Sat. only) and you have an awesome meal. The only complaints are the long lines and the random hours."
2109,"i finally tried hot doug's! since i live in chicago, i didn't want to venture over to hot doug's on a weekend to wait over an hour in line (although this means no duck frit fries), so i went with the BF on a weekday right after lunch rush (well around 1). we waited for about 45 mins and then placed our order with mr. doug. we tried to order a large soda but was told that since there are free refills, we should just get small (um, why would you say no to that?). considering we waited in line for so long, we didn't want to order just 2 dogs and leave feeling hungry (cuz we were not going to stand in line AGAIN) so we ordered the fois gras duck sausage, bacon sausage, the Dog (chicago style) with everything and a small order of cheese fries. the fois gras duck sausage was sooo good. it was so smooth and tasty. i didn't like the bacon sausage too much - it came with onions and brie cheese but compared to the duck sauage, the bacon sausage's flavor and texture just wasn't as great. the chicago style dog was not the best - the celery salt was really heavy - but then again, that one was only 1.75 (tax included). and the cheese fries... were oh so delicious! they do not go cheap on the cheese or the fries actually. a small is def enough for 2 people and you don't have to fight over the cheese. i pretty much ate the whole order myself though because i thought the fries were really good (i was afraid i would be disappointed in not having duck frit fries but yea.. the cheese fries def made me happy enough). everything other than the special dogs are pretty cheap here. the prices on the menu are tax included so you can calculate your total quite easily so you know you have enough cash (that is exactly what we did because we forgot about the cash only policy till we were in line but thankfully BF had enough). the specials are kind of pricey but then you can't find it anywhere else! i would come again (on a weekday to hopefully not wait in a long line) to try the special dogs (going to skip the basic ones) plus order those cheese fries. and yelpers are correct - there is always an empty table. i think they have a policy where you can't sit at a table until you order your food, which totally makes sense. people can't hog up tables while waiting so that the people actually trying to eat can have tables to sit on! this way, you will always be able to find a table to open for you when its finally your turn to eat."
2110,"Look, I don't mean to be contrary. Call me an out of towner, a food snob, whatever. But I understand good eats, and I have eaten enough hot dogs to consider myself a worthy critic. But I am apparently alone in my opinion of these dogs. Like so many foodies, I planned my trip to Hot Doug's months in advance of my stay in Chicago, having seen the virtues of this place touted on various TV food shows. Other than a very friendly Doug at the counter, and the cool ""hole in the wall"" atmosphere, the experience was a massive disappointment. I had a Chicago Dog, a Chili Cheese Dog, and the Fois Gras dog, and all were usatisfactory. The wieners themselves were tiny and unremarkable. I've had better Chicago Dogs at the Triple A baseball field in SLC. Aren't Chicago Dogs supposed to have sport peppers on them? And what exactly is that cheese made of?? I've gotten suckered into too many bad meals by watching The Food Network. Screw it."
2111,"Come on doug. do you really need another 5 review? well my friend, you got one. most of the stars are for your service at the counter. The dogs arent too bad either."
2112,"Thank you for Hot Doug's! This place is phenomenal. Don't think just hot dogs, think ""encased meats"" as Doug puts it. I had a duck sausage with smothered with a fois gras sauce. It was rich and amazing. Also had a boar sausage that was really good. Dogs like these are on the specials board, but they serve plenty of classic dogs and sausages too. The Thuringer is the best classic on the menu...absolutely amazing and what I usually get. The duck fat fries are awesome too, but are only served on Fridays and Saturdays. Only open for lunch only Mon-Sat."
2113,Has Guy Fieri been here yet? No? Good. Let's keep it that way.
2114,"SO GOOD. We went today thinking that the lines on a Friday afternoon would be more forgiving, but there was a largish line even at 11am. So worth it, though. I had the cheddar and bacon elk sausage and my husband had the pork jerk sausage, and we shared duck fat fries. Delicious! (but the duck fat fries really need to be eaten while hot -- when they're lukewarm, they really are not that diff from the regular fries) Cash only here, but all prices include tax. We'll probably run back over to Hot Doug's later in the week to try the alligator sausage. Bring something to read in line on the weekends, or bring a friend who won't mind sweating it out in the sun with you while you wait."
2115,"What can you say about the best hot dog stand in Chicago other than go try it for yourself. I went there today and got a Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Black Truffle Butter, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris and their duck fat fries. It was as good as it can possibly get. The atmosphere is a fun retro style hot dog joint with the music to back it. You will be able to tell you are getting close to the restaurant by the line around the block which is 1 of my 2 complaints is the wait is long for a fast food restaurant but the food more than makes up for it. My second complaint is that they should warn you that the food is so good that you will want more that 1 dog or sausage. If you are craving the duck fat fries make sure you go on a Friday or Saturday as that is the only 2 days they sell them."
2116,"I hadn't been here in over a year. But nothing's changed, and that's the best compliment for this place. I had the ""Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Tartar Sauce and Fontina Cheese"" and it blew my mind. The shrimp added an element that kept the pork sausage interesting. Don't get me wrong! I'm just saying that having two meats with such complementary flavors worked like magic. Kinda like a jambalaya dog, I guess."
2117,The Foie Gras dog will blow your mind. Seriously. Don't be afraid. It is unbelievable.
2118,"Tip: A minute before 10:30am on Saturday, and there's barely any line. Of course maybe you don't want to face eating hot dogs at 10:30am on Saturday -- fair enough. Wasn't crazy about my duck sausage with blood orange mustard and blue cheese -- I mean, it tasted good, but the sausage was a wee bit dry. And at first, the duck fat fries didn't overwhelm me. I thought they were really good, crispy, brown, fresh fries, but just as good as fries fried in regular ol' peanut oil. But the weird thing is that they kinda got better and better over time. I snacked on them out of desperation later in the afternoon (yes, a little gross) and I'll be damned if they still weren't pretty crisp and fresh-tasting. Bionic fries!"
2119,"I can't imagine how you couldn't give this place a five. Where else are you going to have exotic meats for six to eight dollars. The french fries, even the regular ones, are out of this world."
2120,"i had been wanting to try this place FOREVER since seeing it on a pbs special and hot dog paradise on the travel channel. at that time, i was still eating meat and was really interesting in trying the fois gras dog. i can't give this place 5 stars, since i am not eating meat anymore and didn't get to try all the interesting sausage/hot dog choices. however, i will give the duck fat fries a big thumbs up!! so my bro and i walked here, and he used handy dandy google maps in order to find the closest L station. we got off at belmont off the blue and then proceeded to walk a LONG way to find it. after walking about a mile, he thought that perhaps he didn't zoom in on the map, so it was a lot further than it looked. geez. thank god it wasn't super hot, but by the time i got there, i was about to pass out. then i saw the line, and i really was going to faint. the line took about 1 hour, but once you get inside, it is worth it. i just had the veggie dog chi-town style, and my bro had the chicago dog and the game of the day, which was buffalo w/ a remoulade. service here is really fast, and doug himself takes each person's orders!!! i felt like i met a celebrity when he took my order since i've seen him on tv so many times! i wish i was eating meat still so i could try all their sausage choices. maybe by the next time i come to chicago, i will! btw, my brother says he would give it 5 stars, b/c even the regular chicago dog is good, and at $1.75, it's a great deal!! he's a superdawg fan, but i guess that is more expensive."
2121,"There are long lines here for a reason......the variety of sausages, and quality are far greater than most hot dog places...anywhere. I've ordered the special gourmet dogs on a few occasions and enjoyed them more than the regular dog. I'm not a fan of standing in line...and fearing that there will not be a seat when i eventually get my order...but for some strange reason, a seat is always open. I didn't get the duck fries, because another person in line told me its hard to tell the difference from the regular fries. I'm not a fan of the hours they are open...closes early....but if when you have quality product and people standing in long lines to eat your food...you can afford it."
2122,"woe was me when hot doug's closed up in roscoe village. where was i going to get my raquel welch with the obligatory side of fries and a corn dog for desert? then my ears perked up upon hearing swirling rumors of a reopening. and when it rang true, twas truly a joyous occasion. never ever leave us again hot doug's."
2123,"I love this place for its creativity in something I absolutely love: sausages (a.k.a. encased meats). I can just picture Doug and his fellow geniuses huddled in the kitchen, brainstorming on their newest deliciously disgusting creation. One guy goes, ""Gee. I think we should try a chicken and pork sausage combo,"" and the other guy goes, ""And let's throw in some horseradish and a little bit of gouda,"" and of course everyone else chimes in with various other ingredients and spices, and voila!-- a new masterpiece is created. I wish I lived closer. If I could try one new Hot Doug's creation a day, I would be one happy girl. Of course I'd probably become broke and significantly larger . . . but it'd be worth it."
2124,"I haven't had a dog here since around when they opened and I ate meat, but man.. it was delicious. Now I stop in for perfectly done fries (not on duck day). The veggie corndogs get thumbs up from everyone I know whom as tried them, and my family is crazy about the duck fries. Friendly staff, good service, really fun environment. Avondale is Proud of its own cased meat emporium."
2125,Who doesn't enjoy encased meats? This place is really good. It was raining horribly the day we went but there was still a line around the block. We waited it out for about an hour and was not disappointed. Also had the duck fat fries - very tasty.
2126,"Well I would think that ""duck fat fries"" should pretty much sum up why I love this place, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The specialty hot dogs are fantastic, truly a gourmet experience in casing and a bun... and I really don't think you can say that about any other restaurant in Chicago."
2127,"this place gets 5 stars because the owner, Doug, is a really really really really (did i say really?!) nice guy! one of those first impressions you get from a person that sticks with you for a long time. he made me a believer that there are still restaurateurs who do their gig because they absolutely love it and that it's not all about the money. :) stupid me didn't read basic info about this place and found out, while my friend and i were the 5th in line to be served that they only accepted cash. WHAT?! and they don't have an ATM! so my friend went outside to look for one, while i thought of what i'll be able to get with just $13. i figured i can get the foie gras dog that cost $9 (because that was what i came here for, and a regular chicago dog, grilled, and with everything on it for my friend for $1.75. never mind the drink, and never mind the fries (they didn't have the duck fat fries anyway because they only have those fri and sat). so it was my turn and gave him my order. he asked me what i wanted to drink and i said i didn't want any. he asked if i wanted fries and i said no. after which i asked, ""where is the nearest atm?"" and he pointed me to where it was (about a block or two down the street). then he asked, ""is that why you didn't order drinks""? and i said, ""yes."" i told him i didn't know it was cash only and that my friend is on her way to get cash and that we'll just line up again. he said, ""no no there's no more lining up, we'll just take care of it right now. he asked me if i had cash what drink i wanted and i said i wanted a coke. he said ok. he also asked me what kind of fries i wanted if i had cash. i said duck fat fries but since they don't serve it on mondays, i said cheese fries. he said ok. then he asked me how much cash i had. i told him ""$13"". he said, ""alright then, your total is $13."" AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! i almost teared up! hahaha! he was just so nice! i told him i'm sorry and that i'm just visiting and we joked around for a bit. i called up my friend and she was amazed as well and was sooo relieved because the ATM was a bit far and it was about 85 degrees outside! i can never thank him enough! he really cares about his guests. so there. 5 stars. the foie gras dog was a good combo! i liked the touch of sel gris. the regular chicago dog was good as well. all in all, i can't say anything bad about this place. yes the lines are long. but you should already know that when planning to come here. so just be prepared. our line wasn't that long, maybe a good 30 minutes wait. so yeah. i can't wait til i visit Chicago again and try out everything else on the menu! and next time i'm bringing cash. :)"
2128,Best food baby maker in Chicago.
2129,"The best ever... You can't beat good specialty dogs, punk music in the background and an awesome owner. Come before the lunch crowd though, it's a wait..."
2130,I don't need to say anything about this place. Just go.
2131,"oh celery salt, how i long for you to be in my mouth. you too, sausage."
2132,"I really enjoyed the service here. The staff were really friendly, and helpful. I thought that the names for their hot dogs and stuff were HILARIOUS!!! The food is pretty good and the price is good for the food. I LOVE their fries! I also love the decor."
2133,"So much has already been written about Hot Doug's, so I will keep this review brief. Simply said, Hot Doug's is one of the most charming (it's certainly the most hippest) hot dog restaurants in the city. And with a large menu of various dogs and sausages (even a vegetarian dog) complete with colorful ever changing names, you can be as adventurous you want to be. But don't worry, if all you want is a Chicago style hot dog, you won't be disappointed. My only complaint (other than the poor location) is that Hot Doug's is only open until 4pm. Also, you should be warned that if you make the trip out to Hot Doug's on the weekend (closed on Sundays) you will find yourself in a line that goes out the door and down the length of the building's side. Oh, it should also be noted that Doug (who takes your order) just might be the friendliest restaurant owner in Chicago."
2134,"4.5 star rating, nearly 1,000 Yelp reviews - it seems kinda redundant to review this place, but it's also a Chicago institution and consistently ranked amongst the best eateries in the world. WORLD. By guys like, say, Bon Appetit. It's also a Food Network favourite - everyone from Man -vs- Food to die-hard New Yorker Anthony Bourdain dry-hump Doug's counter at some point in time. And you know when you see crowds of people - locals and food nomads, young and old, some still attached to IV drips from their escape from the hospital, some covered in barnacles - standing outside in a line for 2 hours in the snow to get a hot dog that something quite magical is about to occur. O, the magic. It's truly ridiculous - the concept that a couple can spend $30-$40 eating hot dogs (HOT DOGS!!1...actually, if you're going to stand in line for an hour+, you want the Total Hot Dog Experience - you deserve it) until you pop - why would you do this? It's a damn hot dog. But if you don't want to hug Doug (who serves counter, every day, always smiling and kind, a total sausage geek sweetheart, it's bloody madness) on the way out, you're doing it wrong. Go to http://www.hotdougs.com and look at the Specials page if you're still undecided. But there is absolutely no reason you should not be there, right now, eating encased meats. And it's truly a jewel of Chicago. They understand lamb. They have Game specials (always, always try their game specials). They are ingredient pioneers, championing and introducing classic world favourites for the Chicago crowd. Like a great white shark at the bloated carcass of a month-dead sperm whale, your eyes will roll back in your head as you gurgle ""WTF is this tomf**kery?! It's a damn HOT DOG!?! How can it be SO. GOOD?!"" It's an unexpected high, staggeringly remarkable, and yes, worth standing in the snow for (tip: bring coffee). In fact, it's the only place my husband will queue for, ever. And that's saying a lot. My inner food snob is appalled that I've dished out 5 stars for a hot dog joint. My inner food snob can go f**k itself. We love you, Doug."
2135,"I would brave the cold for Doug. And I have. Because the line is always out the door when I get there. And this is Chicago so we all know what the winters are like. After you get in through the 2 sets of doors though, the always friendly Doug takes your order, chats for a bit and then you're good to go. The waitstaff are friendly and attentive - helping people get tables as soon as they pop up. I've been there enough times and they take the time to learn names so they no longer have to call out to find me when my order's ready too. So people = good. The decor is eclectic and fun. And appropriate! Hot dog imagery abounds in a kitschy way. The names of the hot dogs on the menu make me laugh. The music is played at a good level and is always of good taste or at least to my liking (usually rock/rockabilly/punk/seasonal). Ambience = good. So that's my review. Oh, wait? I guess I forgot the food. Riiigggggghhhhhht. Doug is a culinary genius of encased meats. One February I asked him what he had on Valentines day and he said he made his girlfriend some lobster. It wasn't until I got home that it even occurred to me that he didn't say lobster sausage. That was how I pictured it when he said it. I don't normally get the regular menu items (besides tator tots that I don't believe are actually on the menu as their own thing). I always go for a specialty dog (that I look up on their website beforehand). They are awesome. Be adventurous! Various types of meat, decadent toppings, menu changes every week so you can always try something new. Sometimes I think there are too many toppings for the sausage (i.e. surely there is no way he is THAT generous), but everything always tastes well-balanced. I like the creamy sauces for the most part, anything labelled ""atomic"" hits you slowly. My favorite encased meats are the crayfish-pork mix or the teuben. My only complaint is actually about newbies... don't loiter when you're done eating. Those seats are prime real estate."
2136,"Hmmmmm. There was no line today at 2:30. I never thought I would eat here. It was on my blacklist, along with Kuma's. I never thought I'd join the Hot Doug's Bandwagon. But, I have to admit, the foie gras hot dog was delicious. Absolutely. Like the T-Shirt says, ""The two most perfect words in the English Language are: Encased Meats."""
2137,"Whats not to love about a great hot dog? I have only been once, but I left wanting to go back again! I went with a friend and we wanted to try a couple, so ended up getting 3 to share. We ended up choosing the foie gras dog, the Chicago style dog, and a special they had, tomato basil. All were absolutely wonderful! The fries were standard, I really would love to try the duck fat fries, but those are only available on Fridays and Saturdays. Fun and affordable experience overall!"
2138,"Seriously how many Hot Dog places get a 25 from Zagat for food. I just wish the hours and lines were more convenient. Now that I am on Vytorin, I would be there a ton.. Example : I have the menu bookmarked on my blackberry and saw the menu was a killer this Saturday...( Venison, elk, and buffalo in one sausage ...ribeye..bacon...) get there and the line is almost to the alley...I had to skip it because I did not have enough time and I yearned for it the rest of the weekend..."
2139,"Doug's not that hot (Fat, typical Chicago Male), but the Hot Dogs, Sausages, and Fries are Damn Good!"
2140,"Hot Doug's is an essential Chicago landmark, not to be missed unless you are a Vegan. There are limited Vegetarian options, but I am told the veggie dog is great. I take all of my friends and visitors to Hot Doug's whenever I can. I count the Rattlesnake dog with caramelized onions and sweet curry mustard I had there as one of the best eating experiences of my life. I have never been disappointed by anything I've ever ordered and was ecstatic when my wife and friends took me out to Hot Doug's for a birthday lunch - She even got me an awesome Hot dog t-shirt and buttons with images of all the types of meats and wild game you can get there. While the specialty dogs may initially seem a tad expensive for 'just a sausage'... they are so good, Doug could easily charge more... but he doesn't because he clearly likes what he does and loves his customers. It's really a bargain. Particularly in nice weather, there is likely to be a line, but it is well worth the wait and you are likely to meet fun and friendly people and once the doors open, things move along very well. It's worth it - Hot Doug's isn't just a meal, its an experience. And the staff there are fun and pleasant people who work with a quickness which must be seen to be believed. Be sure to drop a couple extra dollars in the tip jar at the counter and know that they deserve it. To top it all off, Doug is an exemplary local business owner who regularly supports the local community and nonprofit organizations. Hot Doug's earns and deserves your patronage."
2141,There's really nothing to say that hasn't already been said. The hot dogs and duck fat fries are easily worth the wait. I had the gyros dog and lamb with harissa and haloumi cheese. Both were phenomenal.
2142,"Imagination is rare, hence the line but imagination is worth waiting for. I had the game of the week (this time Ostrich with cherries and cheddar) which was mind blowing. The veggie dog while nothing as creative as the others tasted just like a real hot dog, which I suppose is quite creative if you've ever tasted one of those horrible Smart Dogs from Whole Foods. Although the line was long, it seemed directly matched up with tables making it easy to get one right after you ordered. Duck fat fries: put this on Randolph and we'd have an Iron Chef Doug."
2143,"Chicago, hands down, has the most amazing encased meats in the nation. It truly is a meaty heaven. I went to Hot Dougs after seeing it on the travel channel. Wanting to try as much as possible I ordered a regular hot dog, an Italian sausage, and had the man at the counter pick one off their special list for me. He surprised me with the foie gras dog. I told the man to fix all the dogs as if he were making them for his family. I wasn't disappointed. I began with the regular dog which upon seeing it wasn't sure on my plan of attack. It took the steadiness of a jenga expert to balance the pickle, tomato, and peppers. The dog was amazing. From the very first bite I knew Chicago wasn't serving your ordinary Oscar Meyers. The flavors from all the toppings melded into something magical. The second one to go was the Italian sausage. Crazy deliciousness. Just the right amount of spices in the sausage and so good I ate it too fast to tell you what they put on top. The final leg of my hot dog trek was the unknown foie gras dog. I've only herd about the fatty liver from shows like Top Chef and I was about it eat it for the first time on a hot dog. The sausage along with the foie gras and the creamy sauce on top make for something toe curling. First, foie gras to me was like a creamy well seasoned rich butter. And secondly, it is something I doubt you can get anywhere else. You must try this dog if you go there. Even if you don't like liver, which I don't, put the thought in the back of your mind and order it. You won't regret it."
2144,"Okay, so, being from Los Angeles, the hot dogs here are done one of two ways: relish, mustard, ketchup and maybe some jalapenos. . .and then there's the ghetto dog way. . .the link wrapped in bacon and grilled on a baking sheet on top of a shopping cart by a Mexican in downtown LA. It's then piled high with grilled onions, peppers, and what else, but a giant jalapeno. Oh and the bun is rolled around in the bacon grease to make it extra delectable. So when I came to Chicago, even as a dog lover, I was a little hesitant at first to try the dogs here. Pickle, onions (bleh), tomato, and CELERY SALT? That's some crazytalk man. But I mean, it's a Chicago staple, you've got to try it. So my friend and I, being crazy foodies, decided to take the metro, transfer twice, and take a bus all the way to Hot Doug's for some of the best (we've heard) dogs in the city. After a 90 min trek. . .we made it. The line was wrapped around the building, but there were empty seats inside. Apparently the owner won't let you sit before you eat! But that ensures that everyone who orders food will get to sit and enjoy their meal! And even though this method doesn't seem to make logical sense at first, somehow it all works out. My friend and I, between the two of us, ordered five dogs: The Dog w/ everything (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) Shrimp and Pork Sausage with goat cheese (http://www.yelp.com/biz_), the Marty Allen w/ everything (http://www.yelp.com/biz_), the Atomic Bomb aka spicy sausage with pepperjack cheese (http://www.yelp.com/biz_) and the Saucisson Alsacienne aka bacon sausage with double cream brie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_). . .oh and of course, an order of small fries. The owner took our order, and I have to say, he is the nicest dude and super efficient. He approved my ordering The Dog with everything on it. Out of all the fancy dogs I had that day, I actually preferred The Dog. I loved the crunchy pickle, the sweet onions, the juicy tomato and the celery salt. . .yum. I thought the Saucisson Alsacienne was super rich, especially since it was piled high with creamy brie, and the Atomic Bomb was quite spicy as well. I mean, I love cheese and all, but I think I got a near overload, since halfway through the meal, my buddy and I were eating the hot dogs sans the cheese. I would definitely come back again. . .even though the bill was crazy. . .I think the five dogs and small fries plus two sodas set us back maybe 45 bucks! Insane, but the food was great, the store and service were good and they also have some interesting soda brands in the fridge!"
2145,"1) its a pain to get here. if you are a tourist (like we were), rent a car, otherwise the metro is complex and long to get there 2) omfg lines. the lines. we waited 1.5 hours to get in. 3) the prices, so awesome. $1.75 for a beef hot dog. $8 for the foie gras hot dog. 4) the foie gras hot dog 5) duck fat fries 6) foie gras hot dog 7) doug himself, such a nice dude. Let me just explain #5 and #6. Duck fat fries Fri/Sat. So good, deliciously seasoned. Foie gras hot dog = duck sausage, foie gras on top, nuclearly good sauce. If you only have one chicago hot dog, just go to doug's. You'll pay under $10 (even if you eat 2 hot dogs), you'll wait, but in the end, you'll orgasms from hot dog heaven. While Pink's in LA is ridiculous hot dogs, Hot Doug's is legit textbook hot dogs."
2146,"The only place casual or otherwise where I can order Keira Knightley with my foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse and fleur de sel to wash down with a bottle of Green River. I love Hot Doug's. And yes, Doug Sohn the owner sort of resembles a sausage but I think that's a good thing."
2147,"Damn you Doug and your Hot Doug's!!! For the first time in my life I thought I had found the way; the Fred's franks way, but noooo - I had to go to Chicago. Fine. Fred's franks are seasonal and nooo, Fred doesn't offer Fries fried in Duck Fact on Friday & Saturday. Alas, it is true Fred doesn't offer a dozen varieties of mind-blowing, house-ground encased meats. Nor does Fred offer them topped with such things as Fois Gras. And yes, Doug's zen-like calm demeanor in spite of the throngs of barely patient people loosely organized into a line around the corner might provoke you to contemplate the possibility that encased meat IS happiness and therefore we all have happiness within ourselves since each of us might rightly consider ourselves as meats encased.... Less philosophically, what is it about the the chicago-style dawg that makes it so good? The obnoxious condiments? The rich flavor, bright red color, the snappy encasement and the big honking pickle I first thought someone was too lazy to place next to the dawg, not on it? Hmmm, I wonder what Fred could do with one of Doug's Hot Dawgs or even an ordinary chicago-style one? In any event, kudos to Doug and his Hot Doug's for proving the impossible nearly possible!"
2148,"Haven't eaten here in a while so my fiance, being the awesome lady that she is, waited in line to pick up Doug's to go for my birthday. The ""small"" order of cheese fries is probably bigger than a large order at most of your other hot dog joints. They were delicious and generously slathered in cheese. I also ordered the celeb sausage of the day (Mole Smoked Chicken Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Queso Enchilada) and the Spicy Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Jerk Mayonnaise, Smoked Gouda Cheese and Roasted Plantains. The Mole Chicken sausage was very good, but the true standout was the Jamaican Jerk Sausage. The sweetness from the plantains blended perfectly with the spice in the sausage and the slight smoky richness of the gouda. Any questions about Doug retaining the title of Sausage King of Chicago can be put to rest. Sorry Abe Froman..."
2149,"It's okay. The hot dogs are good Chicago-style hot dogs but not the best you can get. The more exotic sausage creations (Gator, rattlesnake, rabbit, etc.) are good, but dude totally overdoes it with the sauce and cheeses. The duck fat fries are a little skinnier and crispier but I can't really tell the difference. I don't care for Doug's fries, duck fat or not, because they're not blanched and double-fried like the best fries are. If you see a line, keep driving because it's not worth the wait."
2150,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about this place. I'll go ahead and say that all I had was their regular hot dog, but I thought it was very average. The atmosphere was great, but I think the hot dogs are very overrated."
2151,"Why is this place so freaking awesome that they get to close at 4pm! AHHHHH sucks for me! I can't wait the day that I'm so amazingly good at something that I can close freaking early and still have amazing business. That says a crap load. That's why one day you will be mine. Until then, be prepared Hot Doug's....or me?"
2152,"what a cool place. when we got there (a sat) the line went outside and on the sidewalk for a bit. The main menu is ok, but the specials are awesome: antelope sausage? elk sausage? pretty cool stuff. I had chorizo with chipotle mayo and smoked gouda. it was quite good and the service is fast (once you place your order that is). the fries are homemade and actually taste like potato. the only thing is that, man, that sausage is sitting hard in my stomach. i mean you think oh i'm just having a sausage...it's not like a half pound burger or something, but no, it's heavy as hell. enjoy the craziness of the place, just don't plan on running around afterwards."
2153,"I know I'm gonna get hell for this because this seems to be Chicago's newest favorite hot dog joint but I can only give my honest and unbiased opinion. This place has been misclassified as a hot dog stand and it's not. It's a gourmet sausage shoppe whose sausages are served on a bun. Don't get me wrong, their plain ole hot dog is good but if I'm going to go to a hot dog stand, I want to go to a HOT DOG stand not some gourmet sausage shoppe. That's my biggest beef with this place."
2154,Great hot dogs.. The duck fat fries were a bit of a let down. They were ok.. but not as spectactular as I expected. However the Line.. OMG the line. 2.5 hours on a friday early afternoon. I think they have it setup where they will have a line. The eating area is small. and they don't wait on people until a table is free. I think they make a line on purpose. Just to keep the hype. The dogs are worth the wait. However... they could make it smaller by setting things up a bit better.
2155,"simple review! great selection, great quality, great prices and can't say enough about Doug"
2156,"We waited from noon to 2pm on Saturday to get in the door. Doug took our order and was very friendly and nice (I would be too if I were making cash hand over fist like he is). We had the bacon duck with goat cheese (really good), wild boar with chili and cheese (favorite of the bunch), cherry and apple pork sausage with mustard and chocolate (okay but a lot of chocolate), Chicago dog (very good), and veggie dog with the works (not a lot of flavor compared to the others). The duck fat fries were very crispy and good (available Friday and Saturday). We were told the foie gras dog was good. Worth the wait? Yes, but we wouldn't wait that long a second time. Next time we'll get there early and hope the line is shorter. Bring cash! The specialty dogs are around $8, regular dog is around $2."
2157,"This is the best place in the universe!!! I would like to give more than 5 stars...I LOVE HOT DOUG'S. I do everything humanly possible to cut out early and get lunch here at least once a week. The fries are the best, the plain old hot dogs are so much better than anywhere else, and the other selections are always enticing. They have veg. options too, and a fun selection of drinks. Great music, other customers are usually friendly and willing to talk if you want to...The staff is super nice, and when they remembered my name I felt very special...It's worth the wait x's 100!"
2158,"Mmmmm duck fat fries. Yes, it sounds gross, but they are so yumming delicious! I had the gyro doug and it was really good. They have some interesting dougs like the britney spears and elvis costello which are all custom made. The service is fast once you get inside (the wait can be really long) and Doug is always there to greet you! A Chicago classic."
2159,I love this place!!! Something about cylindrical meat in a casing that tastes soooo good. You have to try the Elvis. It's by far the best thing they offer. A must for any hot dog aficionado or just anyone visiting Chicago.
2160,"(Obama reference to come..) I can't say i hate Hot Doug's, but after having been here several times, I just think its not worth it. I gave in to the novelty at first and I'd probably go here again if a friend wanted to try it. My beefs with hot dougs are: There is no reason to wait 1 + hours for anything and you can almost count on that here. The whole novelty of this place is the ""gourmet"" hot dogs which can yes at times taste pretty good but honestly often times not for the price you pay... and 1 dog is too small for a meal so you have to order another regular menu item or maybe another special dog, plus fries.. plus a drink.. So your hot dog meal ends up costing 15-20 bucks?!... did i mention the line? Seriously this is one of those businesses which intentionally restricts either its size or efficiency to build lines and thus popularity. Good for business, annoying for me. There is absolutely nothing physically around this building and instead of expanding, or maybe adding say.. 1 more cashier... just ONE more.. they keep things the same... Heres an idea Doug - decrease the wait to say 20 minutes - and you'll still have a line outside but at least I won't be totally running out of things to talk about while I'm waiting, checking my watch every 5 minutes, and can actually enjoy the dogs you serve. Not trying to be a hater, this place is still gonna stay at 4.5 stars overall even if I gave it 500 2 star reviews. But for such a unique Chicago restaurant, I think some CHANGE is due. YES WE CAN YES WE CAN! ..k a lil contrived, i realize:)"
2161,"Went here at 11am on a weekday just before I left Chicago, still had to wait in line for 20 min! It was okay though cause we had planned accordingly. Now I love hot dogs, but of course since these are specialty sausages they don't bear THAT much in common taste-wise. I ordered some of the wilder things (elk sausage) and I liked it, but I didn't see God like a lot of the other reviewers. Worth going back to with out-of-town visitors, and I loved how comparatively cheap it was, and the decoration was adorable, but I wouldn't make the trip out to Avondale all the time just to eat here myself."
2162,I'm not a big fancy hot dog guy. There's nothing wrong with a good old American hot dog and they are good here but there are better.
2163,Yea. What's with the hours? Most people are at work while they are open. Good service. Good food. Small seating space.
2164,"This place really did exceed my expectations. The line was a bit long, but was well worth the wait. The menu makes it almost impossible to decide what you want because it all sounds delicious. I had an anduille chicago-style, buffalo sausage with aged cheddar and some ridiculous mustard i cant remember, but the best was the rabbit sausage with white wine dijon and fresh feta chesse (think soft, not crumbly). Duck fat fries were also unreal. I felt like an absolute glutton, but it was an experience I will not soon forget."
2165,This is a great place to clog your arteries with delicious Duck Fat Fries and more hot dog and sausage combinations galore.
2166,"Will I come back to eat Hot Doug's? YES. Will I wait in line for 2.5 hours again? NO. I think this place is worth maybe one hour wait at most..... but I think people wait longer because there are a lot of tourists who come here from far away, and it'd be ridiculous to not wait, since they're already here. I'm a BIG fan of foie gras, and that is one of the reasons why I want to eat at Hot Doug's. But expect fancy preparation of foir gras, that's all I'm saying. It's not bad, worth a try. Very interesting to incorporate foir gras in hot dogs I must say. My friend and I ordered 80% of their menu... spent close to $100...I mean, go big or go home right? Might as well if we spent 2.5 hours of our lives waiting to get in. Some hot dogs are good, but some are just like ""what the f*uck did I just put in my mouth?"" So you just gotta try all of them I guess. But I must warn you, it'll cost ya. Towards the end I felt like a blood vessel popped due to overload in grease. (yes, we ordered duck fat fries, and they're good). So, a good strategy to attack this place, is to bring a bunch of friends, order one of each on the menu. Everyone gets a bite, so everyone gets the most out of waiting. And go run 5 miles afterward. P.S. don't get the nuclear green relish. It's absolutely disgusting."
2167,"Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm DEFINITELY coming back to Hot Doug's!! LOVED IT. Great hot dogs, fun atmosphere, got our order taken by Doug himself, just come early cause of early closing time and that line that wraps around the corner! All the way from LA, these Chicago dogs are goood. :)"
2168,Best Hot Dogs in the cIty
2169,"This place is a MUST for all foodies visiting or living in Chicago. Every hot dog I've had here has been fantastic, they have some really interesting and exotic combinations. And OMG the Duck Fat Fries, soooooo good!!! The line can be long at times but I assure you it's well worth the wait"
2170,"Large Variety, that is why I give it 5 stars, if you don't like one style, you will definitely find your dog within time. Love all the toppings they put on the dogs, the different types of meat, and atmosphere. Insane long line though! Ya, and just for hot dogs, i was waiting about 30-40 min until i was able to order my dogs, but......its worth it if you find your right dog."
2171,"If you're good, you'll go to Hot Dougs when you die. If you're bad, you'll go to Moonshine."
2172,"I have just returned from my first visit to Doug's, and I can say with confidence that this place earns its hype. I had been salivating over the pictures and menu descriptions since moving to Chicago last year, and finally decided to give in temptation. It didn't hurt that my girlfriend told my parents to get me Hot Doug's gift certificates for my recent birthday (which Doug sent BEFORE they paid for them, by the way). The place was a convenient 20 minute walk for a Northsider such as myself, and arriving around 11:30AM there was a 30 minute line filled with a variety of folks (decked out hipsters to the front, a guy behind us with a suitcase on wheels who I imagined scheduled his layover with time for a hot dog run). We ordered four dogs and two drinks from Doug manning the register personally, who matched my mom's description of seeming like ""such a sweet guy."" He remembered sending off the hot dog vouchers to me, and just took my $20 worth of paper back and called it even for what we calculated was actually around $30 retail. It's that kind of kindness and personal touch which makes a lot of Doug's regulars regular, I bet. The encased meats in question came through the assembly line with the quickness, and we started with the most luxurious of the lot: the fois gras duck sausage, which we agreed was one of the tastiest things we had ever had (PETA be damned). Then there was the cognac and pheasant sausage, which was a stark flavor contrast from the last with its wine sauce making it more of the fruit serving of this deluxe meat tray. The Marty Allen was next, slathered in traditional Chicago hot dog condimentation, and proved that Doug's makes a regional dog that stands toe to toe with the old guard (and we were able to switch out the onions for sauerkraut for a juicy alternative!) And last but certainly not least was the ""game of the week"": wild boar sausage. I would have never imagined such a snarly little prehistoric looking creature would be such a tasty treat on a bun. And that chistou cheese sprinkled on top had that authentic aged cheese taste, like all those $20 French bricks they have at Whole Foods I dream about melting onto nachos. This was certainly a memorable dining experience, one that I won't hesitate to recommend to others. And to those that are put off by the price, you may have a little piece of mind in that all of the menu prices have tax included (which makes it easy for the percentage dummies such as myself to figure out how far they can stretch their sausage dollar). And I also think that the cash only policy probably keeps the prices down by not having to shill out monthly to Visa. I think if you moved it to a bigger building, made 10 of these and scattered them around the city, or even expanded the hours it would disrupt that personal touch that was a big part of why I loved this place. Let's keep Doug at the register where he belongs."
2173,"I made my second trip to Hot Doug's on a Saturday morning. Little did I know that there was a long line at 11:30am. Despite the long drive to get to this place, we decided to stand in line and wait....and we waited for 1.5 hours. Finally after a little past 1pm, we were able to order our 3 special dogs: Uber Garlic, Today's special (which I can't remember), and the celebrity sausage that just melted in our mouth. Plus, we finally got the duck fat fries!! All I have to say, despite the long wait, it was worthwhile! You can't find any place like Hot Doug's!!!"
2174,"The rave reviews don't lie - Hot Doug's will always be a staple on our Chicago trip itinerary. The long lines are there for a reason, so no point in griping about that. I would agree to going there during the weekday for shorter lines, except that you'd be missing out on the Duck Fat Fries, which are served on Fridays and Saturdays only."
2175,"Great food but it's hard to love as much as when back in the day when it was located by Roscoe and Western where you would never have to wait. For years while I was at Lane Tech I went there and now it's been ruined with the ridiculous wait. Just like Kuma's, amazing food, but the wait can just get so irritating."
2176,They close at 4. We got there just past 4 and there was a line waiting that they wouldn't let us join. They were very rude right off the bat. Can't speak to the food but the service was terrible and the place is way too crowded.
2177,"Doug has mastered the art of encased meats. The game of the week is quite interesting: some top ones include the elk sausage, gator, duck. The chorizo is remarkable but you may want to take a few days to eat it or your tummy might pay for it in the morning. Oh the line...and those annoying hours, and closed on Sunday. These should all be knocks against the place, but quite frankly, I really have to respect the fact that he doesn't give a damn."
2178,Prime Rib Hot Dog. Loosen your wallet and go for the specials; they along with the duck fat fries make the wait worth it. Oh and corn dogs. My god the corn dogs. This is not even to be compared to the frozen variety your mom served. If I could give Doug more stars I would.
2179,"Yes! My first Yelp review and I had to write a review for this place. I just came back from Chicago this past weekend and I can't stop thinking about Hot Doug's. It was a scorching 90 something degrees when we went there. We were told the wait was 1 1/2 hours and almost left, but something told us to stay. I had the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli and it was unbelievably delicious. I love getting anything with foie gras so this was an obvious choice. I highly recommend getting it char-broiled. I also had the fries cooked in duck fat (only available on fridays & saturdays!) and that was extremely tasty also. The prices were not expensive at all too...ranging from $1.25 (for a regular Chicago hot dog) to $9 (foie gras duck sausage hot dog). If you're ever in Chicago or if you live in Chicago, PLEASE PLEASE go to Hot Doug's! It's totally worth the wait.!"
2180,fantabulous! this is THE place for dogs in Chi-Town... everything and everything is great... hate that they are not open late but if they make their money during daytime hours why stay open late... best chi dog in the city... yup better then the place you think is great...
2181,"Hot Doug's makes one mean hot dog. With choices like rib eye sausage and sweet pepper and mozzarella chicken sausage, you can rest assured that you won't be eating a run-of-the-mill ball park frank. As a first-timer, I ordered ""The Dog"" - a Chicago-style hot dog with all the trimmings: pickle, onions, tomato... delicious! The duck fat fries may sound a bit strange, but they are so flavorful and fried to perfection. These fries were so ridiculously good. The restaurant is colorful, bright, and has lots of character. The line was out the door and around the corner when I went, but definitely worth the wait. If I'm ever in Chicago again, you'll find me here for sure."
2182,"I don't like bicyclists. Sure, people who randomly own bikes are fine. And I believe in environmentalism. I drive a car that gets over 30 mpg. I refer specifically to the obnoxious, self-righteous, critical-mass, not-equipped-with-brakes, traffic-borking, ""one less car"" herding mouthbreathers. I've overheard the most ridiculous conversations between These People while standing in the (very long) line at Doug's. E.g.: ""Like, I was riding my fixie through Roscoe Village the other night when a goddamn PEDESTRIAN HIT ME!!! How dare she! She acted like her arm was broken and demanded my drivers license, and I was, like, I don't haaavvee a drivers license."" Listen, grease-Trixie: Pedestrians don't hit you. You hit pedestrians. In fact, if you added a tiny little LIGHT or maybe even some rudimentary BRAKES to your uber-chic stripped-down safety hazard you would probably have avoided this accident altogether. Anyway, if you're like me and don't like snotty bicyclists, avoid this place, especially in the summer. It's almost as bad as Handlebar. Other than that, the wild boar sausage is to die for. Yelp shakes down small businesses: http://digg.com/food_dri"
2183,"I am perfectly okay with waiting for an hour to order and eat a hot dog. I know, a HOT DOG! But I've waited longer for worse food. That said, make Hot Doug's a social event, take friends, take a book, take the thrill of people watching. It is absolutely worth the wait. The dogs themselves are tasty morsels of awesome that left me dreaming about their plump snappy goodness the minute I took the last bite. The selection of dog's is indeed incredible, from yr basic dog to gourmet sausages. Don't be afraid to get it with everything and skip the ketchup; after all, this is Chicago. And don't forget the fries. Man can not live on encased meats alone and heaven know's I've tried. I didn't expect the large order of fries to be, well, so large. But that's not a complaint, since I love fries and it's likely that I could eat all of mine and half of yours when I've finished what's on my plate. They were the tastiest bag of fries I've ever had, making it more than easy to polish the whole lot of them off. They're everything fries should be, including fresh and hot. I've eaten a lot of dogs (and burgers) in my life and there are a multitude of sins that can be forgiven if you're fries are up to par. To have both a good dog AND good fries at Hot Doug's is a transcendental experience."
2184,"I've been going to Hot Doug's since early 2005 and it seems like as every year passes, my desire to go lessens. I think people need to start focusing on the food rather than ""Doug"" to start getting some honest reviews here. For anyone new to Doug's, you would swear that he is some sort of God-like figure... people walk up to that counter with nervousness and admiration. Everyone seems like they have to ""consult"" with him on advice. Questions like, ""Do you get that new (insert indie band) CD"" or ""Where did you go on vacation?"" Just order your damn food and maybe the line would move and it wouldn't take so long to order. I was there this past Saturday and there is now a line out the door at 10:30! Why? On paper (the website) all the food looks so good. Foie gras, blue cheese, wild boar, etc. But, when you sit down and eat the food, I'm always left saying, ""Why?"" Why did I just wait an hour for what is simply a sausage on a bun. No matter if it's boar, elk, ribeye, pork, it just tastes like a sausage on a bun. His gourmet condiments sound better on paper than they taste. Usually, when you are happy with a restaurant you are looking forward to coming back, but I don't get like that with Hot Doug's. Hot Doug's is simply overrated and all hype. It's like the hype you have waiting for an iPhone or a PS3... You open the box, take it out, and then it becomes just a thing on your desk... all that anticipation and then realizing it's no big deal. I'm done being part of the crowd of people that would rather ask Doug what he had for breakfast than actually start going their for the food. Matt"
2185,"Amazing food...and I mean amazing! The hours are however, unacceptable. Apparently if you have a 9-5 job you are not welcome here. People love this product. Sell it them and make your customers and future employees (God forbid you look at the social impact of your doors being open longer) happy. Lose the pretentious hipster hours please."
2186,streamlined service. a no-nonsense menu that is full of nonsense and...encased meats. the wait in line is well worth the smile that will visit your belly.
2187,I never loved a hot dog till I had a Chicago hot dog. Hot Doug was delish! The food as well as Doug himself!
2188,"Honestly, this is one of those places that when someone says ""I really like hot dogs"" and you ask them what their favorite Hot Dougs sausage is, and they can't answer, you stop trusting them as a friend. Everything is great here. You can go with the standard Chicago dog, which all good chicagoans can appreciate, all the way to a Duck Sausage with Foie Gras Mousse. I've yet to have a bad meal from Hot Dougs, not have I dined with anyone who had a bad meal. Some of the Sausages are very heavy, so be prepared, it may seem indulgent to get two sausages, but be prepared for a post-sausage food coma if you do."
2189,"Truly the finest in encased meats. I wish the location was more accessible from downtown, though the concept and execution here is awesome. And the names of the dogs are great - hilarious and apt. And oooooh those duck fat fries."
2190,"Things I dislike: sausage, tomatoes, mustard, relish, pork, avocado, onions, mayonnaise. Things I love: The Keira Knightley, Atomic Bomb, BLT, Taco Sausage, and any other beautiful concoction Doug comes up with. I was nervous on my first trip to Hot Doug's, because I am so incredibly picky. Grilled cheese, strawberries, and salsa are really all I need. But after my first trip, I was hooked. Seriously, EVERYTHING is great. Foie Gras? Count me in! Unfortunately, I moved back to Kansas City. Looking at the website right now, I see that I am missing out on Jamaican Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy Mango-Passion Fruit Mayonnaise and Roasted Plantains, Jalapeno-Cheddar Pork Sausage with Jalapeno Mayonnaise and Habanero-Jack Cheese, and Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Thai Peanut Sauce and Toasted Coconut. I am kicking myself for moving. If I ever move back to Chicago (which is very likely), Hot Doug's will be the first place I go. Doug is super nice, and I have never met anyone in line who wasn't friendly. A plus since the line can get a little ridiculous."
2191,"I only had a hot dog from one other establishment while on my visit to Chicago, but I can safely say that I doubt there is a better hot dog joint in the city. This place was fantastic. And not only because its named after me....or that it has a mascot that kinda looks like me if I was a hot dog. But simply because it was the best damn dog I've ever had (yes, potentially exceding my love for the Guadalahara Dog at Pinks). I went with the Don Rickles (a beef and pork dog with a healthy dose of garlic) Chicago style. I'm an LA boy, so for those of you in LA who don't know what Chicago style is, this puppy was topped with onions, relish (greener then your average relish), sliced tomatoes, mustard, and a dill pickle spear....and this is the key...garnished with Celery salt. Bliss i tell you. Jenny had the Merguez dog with feta cheese and a tomatoe sauce. Not your traditional Merguez but really good. Fries were delish. This place is sorta in the middle of nothin, from what I could tell, but well worth the trip. Seriously, buy a plane ticket today and fly to Chicago simply for a taste of one of these puppies."
2192,"I'm glad that Hot Doug continues to do well at his new location, I missed his old Roscoe Village shop for a while, but the California Av. location does have its advantages, such as more street parking! I don't recall that I've ever tried a ""regular"" hot dog here as I am always intrigued by the specials & ""gourmet"" offerings. There is ALWAYS a line out the door on saturdays, but the food is worth the wait, you can spend your wait time reviewing the different menu options . The counter is run by Doug himself & the atmosphere is very friendly in spite of being very very busy. The duck fat fries served on Fridays & Saturdays are not to be missed! I only wish Hot Doug's was open on Sundays too!"
2193,"I like this place. Alot. Everything I've had there is amazing. I mean it. I like that Doug only keeps this place open during weird hours. I like that he wont add anything to the menu if it means extra work. I like that he is the sweetest hot dog vendor in Chicago. My yuppie sensibility also likes the idea of having fancy cheeses and sauces on such a trashy medium and my trashy sensibility loves the fact that you can order fries cooked in duck fat. Five stars but for the fact that I thought all the sausages were house made. Yes, I really did think that he made Vienna hot dogs from scratch. I'm naive like that. Can I have a corn dog fried in duck fat?"
2194,"A real Chicago icon! If you haven't been there, you're really missing out! This place is famous, with thousands of reviews & numerous features on TV shows like ""No Reservations"" and ""Future Foods"". I've been to Hot Doug's many, many times, & I've even flown their food with me 700 miles to veg on at it home (fyi the fries don't keep after refrigeration, but the dogs are still great!). I debated myself viciously over giving Doug's a 4 or 5 star review (considering 4 because, well I mean come on, a 2 hour wait for a hot dog?!?!), but I will settle on 5 primarily because Doug runs that place his way or the highway, and it's damn tasty, cheap, and just fun! You gotta respect a guy like that! The place really has personality! I heard that he pays his employees six weeks of vacation each year, & I believe it since they're closed for a month & a half every winter, & his staff is always the same people. I even read online that he used to be a fine dining chef, and he quit that job to open up his hot dog Mecca! I'd believe that too, as his menu is jam packed with elements of top notch cuisine blended into encased meat magic. You can dine on Elk sausage, partake of duck sausage topped with foie gras, or enjoy some Cajun shrimp remoulade! The Good: The food is great. Nuff said. Anthony Bourdain agrees, and so do like 1,000 Yelp reviewers. The decor is hilarious - from the men's & women's restroom signs (a hot dog in a bun & just a bun w/o a dog) to Doug's unique naming system for his menu. You also have gotta like the hard hats the kitchen crew wear - real men at work! The price is crazy cheap for what you get, especially if you don't indulge in the specials & remain in regular hot dog land. Do NOT order a large fry because you WON'T finish it! You'll also notice that Doug is a good man - his giant tip jar has a sign saying that it goes to the people ""doing actual work"", not him. His bathrooms have signs that say something like ""Employees must, guests should, & really everybody ought to wash their hands."" The Bad: Doug being a true character, he refuses to submit to the fees from credit card companies. This place is CASH ONLY!!! Also, a huge problem is the fact that they close at 4:00pm every day! No dinner service, unless you take some home right before closing. This place is damn popular and amazingly well known. People from all over the country stop here, and the lines are often well over an hour, sometimes 2! The Ugly: Again, the decor! Lol, it's funny & full of character, but it's also ugly. This is NOT a fine dining joint, but that's okay by me :)"
2195,"It isn't very often that vegetarians review hot dog joints, but I was dragged to Hot Doug's by a coworker when we were in town for the day. The results were shocking. I actually loved this place. I got the Pete Shelley (the vegetarian dog), and it was awesome! I am not a fan of fake meat 95% of the time, but this really hit the spot. I would go back again and again if I lived in Chicago. Good work, Doug. You're hot."
2196,"You can only find better deals at that sketchy hot dog stand where you fear to tread. This place is clean, efficient and welcoming, and to get yourself a polish for this cheap... c'mon do yourself the favor. Just avoid it between the hours of 11:30 and 1:30 on weekdays and you'll be alright. If you can catch it any other time I promise the wait is no more than 5 to 10 min depending on your order."
2197,"For a vegetarian who loves hot dogs (or pups) this is as good as it gets. Their vegetarian corn dogs are so delicious, I hate it that they are closed on sundays.. Even the regular hot dougs for vegetarians are very good. One down side is that they are SO GOOD that they are packed. I have waited up to 45 minutes on a saturday just to get my doug- I don't mind, just don't go hungry cuz that would suck!"
2198,"I keep seeing reviews saying they tried the hot dog and not sure what the big deal is. Folks, please, if you're going to wait in line for this place, and trust me you're going to wait, do NOT order from the regular menu. You have to have one of the specialty encased meats on the specials menu, also viewable on their website. As an example, today I had the Jalapeo Smoked Chicken Sausage with Mole la Carlos and Cotija Cheese. Phenomenal. Hope that helps."
2199,"I love this place. It's perfect for foodies that get excited about a sausage made with elk or alligator or some other unusual meat. If you are such a person, then you must make a trip. If you don't see why paying more for a hot dog made of alligator and shrimp than a normal hot dog, than you probably won't like it here. The lines get long, but moved pretty quickly. The times I've been I was with a group so we could each try several of their unique hot dogs. I haven't been disappointed with one yet, the flavors are huge. I wish I could go here more often."
2200,"It is really not necessary for me to write another review for hot dougs, seeing as there are 700+ reviews. But I wanted to say that everytime I go and he has The Atomic Bomb, I have to get it. 2 of them. Its like an asian curry flavor (not an indian curry but like a Thai curry) and the cheese completes it. Not very subtle but so amazing. GET THE ATOMIC BOMB."
2201,"Con: 2 hour wait Pro: ""Encased meats"" completely made up for it. Con: A little pricey for their ""specials"" Pro: Completely worth it. Doug himself greets you and takes your order so it's pretty neat to chat a little with him. We were really looking forward to the duck fat fries but it was forgettable, but we took it with a grain of salt because it was towards the end of the day (they close at 4pm) so the duck fat flavors may already have been soaked up earlier. I LOVED the catalina dog with the saffron rouille (where you can see each strand of fine red saffron). The Hot Doug's BLT was pretty good with the avocado mayo because the ""encased meat"" was an entire tube of bacon. Yes, a whole sausage filled with bacon meat. My friend got the foie gras dog and it was very heavy and creamy. Definitely delicious but I think the saffron rouille dog really took over my palate. Try going early right before they start serving. If you go any later than I say, 2:30-3pm on a weekend (as in friday and saturday), you probably won't be able to make it through the door."
2202,"Gourmet hot dogs! So delicious! I'm not much of a hot dog fan but ever since I had a Hot Doug, I think about the dogs all the time."
2203,"Very Simple... Duck Fat Fries, Chicago Dog steamed with everything (includes carmelized onions the best new addition to tradional chicago dog fare) and you have an afternoon mouth-gasm. Chicago Dogs should be steamed, but it is nice that they give an option for char fans. Expect long lines, which are worth the wait, even in the cold."
2204,"To call Hot Doug's a hot dog stand is highly understating the excellent choices and food. There was everything from a traditional Chicago style dog to gourmet options with such things as Elk, Steak and gourmet cheeses. Worth the wait in line! The owner was really friendly and the atmosphere was bright and engaging. I can't wait to go back and try the Duck fat fries. I can see why Bourdain liked this place."
2205,"Best Ever. Duck fries may be a tad overated, but the the Dogs and sausages are second to none. WIsh they had shorter lines and longer hours, but still a perfect place."
2206,"Anyone giving this place less than a five-star review should be shot on site. Doug, keep sellin' the fwa-graa!"
2207,OMG! Simply delicious..... Well worth the 1 1/2 wait in line.... The Cheese Fries with Chili is a must.....
2208,"we waited 1.5 hours for this. great reviews on yelp and heard from some other folks that this was the place to be. here's what we ordered: foie gras and sauternes duck sausage w/truffile aioli, foie gras mousse and sel gris --- tasty sausage. i'd give it a 7 out of 10. smoked applewurst pork sausage w/sweet curry mustard and tomme de savoie cheese - tastier, slightly sweet. i'd give it a 9 out of 10. corn dog - basic corn dog. it took me beyond full at this point. nothing special, but at least it was only $1.50 fries - we got two kinds: regular with cheese on it (it was good, not great). and fries that are fried in duckfat. to be honest, i could tell the difference in terms of richness in the duck fat fries, and the fries were good, but nothing spectacular like holy shit i gotta grab a handful of them and jack off w/them. the richness you get with the duck fat isn't worth the premium price or the bad cholesterol. all in all, glad we did it. it lived up to its hype and it was certainly the best hot dog i've ever had. however, it wasn't at all the best $9 meal i've ever had, you know what i mean? i wouldn't eat there again. i like gourmet burgers, but when it comes to hotdogs, i guess basic ones are best. they didn't have the greatest buns, just plain, unwarm, and pretty dense -- delivering a concussion to your self-consciousness."
2209,"is this really worth taking my time to write the 1,057 or whatever review? eh, I'll do it anyway. awesome concept, great food, great service. ONE problem: the line is always out the door no matter what time you get there. when I was there I saw the owner (who is always the one taking orders one..by..one...) chatting it up with costumers while the line out the door was only getting bigger. If the guy would just take the orders and go on to the next, I feel as if the line wouldn't be an hour long each day. or if he hired more people. but obviously try it if you havn't, and you have to get the duck fat fries. mmhhh"
2210,From NY....the dog was delish...servers could have saved the attitude. Shop has a great look....go for the dog..not the ppl :)
2211,This is it people.......there is NOT a better place for hot dog's anywhere in the world!!!!!!!! This is the truth......... and on the seventh day god rested and ate at Doug's.............Family Tattoo backs this 100000%....thank god it's down the block.......
2212,"I travel miles and miles for the encased meats and wait in line for what feels like forever and I am not sorry at all. If you think about all the hot dog stands I pass along the way just to get my sausages from here it boggles the mind. Words don't do this place justice, just go! The only downside is parking is street and can potentially suck and the line can try your patience."
2213,"After nearly 10 years of Hot Doug's I can say that I never tire of going to Hot Doug's. From the game of the week to the fire dog, its all good. The only thing that I have a problem with is the long lines. Yet I can't fault anyone for wanting to eat at Doug's."
2214,The dogs are worth the wait. Don't let the long line discourage you. I will definitely come back and try some more of their interesting hot dog combinations.
2215,A dining experience like no other in the world. Also one of the best executed ideas in the world. If you are ever in Chicago and like food you have to go to this place.
2216,"Okay, so I visited this place almost a year ago and forgot to write the review along with other places in Chicago I visited. So, here it is... After waiting in the long line that wrapped around the block, we ordered 3 hot dogs and the duck fat fries. The Keira Knightly, The Dog and the Fois Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli. It wasn't really fois gras, but in mousse form like a pate. Anyway, the dogs were delicious and worth the wait and experience! having the fois gras dog by itself would be too overwhelming, so make sure that you can take bites off of another dog to change up the taste a bit. The duck fat fries with 3 dogs were too much. We couldn't even eat half of the fries so it mostly went to waste. We were so stuffed that we couldn't even taste the duck fat in the fries after chomping away at the hot dogs (mind you... we waited well over an hour!) If it were just me and one other person, I would skip fries all together and order 3 dogs! or just share 2 dogs and order some fries. I could've done without the duck fat ones and just ordered the regular..."
2217,It was everything I expected...simply stunning. We waited in line for a little over 30 minutes to finally order our rattlesnake and duck dogs with duck fat fries. I would suggest going close to when they open or close to not wait as long. Also try to make it on a Friday or Saturday because those are the only days they serve the duck fat fries. You're missing out if you have the chance to eat them and you don't...it's as simple as that.
2218,"I'm not much of a hot dog person, but every time I'm in Chicago I crave for one. Hot Doug's is by far the BEST hot dog joint ever. If you think Pinks is good, you have not tried the best. I love their Andouille sausage. They have specialty dogs on their daily special menu as well that includes exotic meat such a rabbit, rattlesnake, venison, etc. Make sure you try their fries fried in duck fat, available only on Fridays and Saturdays. They are delish! Expect to wait in line; there's always a line outside the door even when it's raining or snowing. It's worth the wait though!"
2219,"Doug has dragged the traditional corner hot dog stand kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century without losing the fun and taste of the original. A regular hot dog is only a buck and a half and is available steamed, grilled, deep-fried, or deep-fried AND grilled. Caramelized onions are not only available, they're standard issue. The fries are nothing short of perfect -- hand-cut and not too greasy. The specials are what set Hot Doug's apart, however. Sausages made with exotic meats and topped with unusual sauces and cheeses are on the menu side by side with the rest of the fast food fare. The nostalgic decor is heavy on sausage and Elvis memorabilia. The mens room has a picture of a bun with a hot dog in it -- the ladies room, an empty bun. Hot Doug's is a MUST for any serious hot dog lover!"
2220,"Makes me wish I were a carnivore, really! I love a place that serves a veggie dog, don't get me wrong, but man, how much would I love to try one of the banned fois-gras dogs, fries cooked in duck fat...wow..."
2221,"Hot Doug's is amazing! Their menu is always changing with new offerings. Although we waited a really long time when we went here. We went on a Saturday so we could get the duck fat fries. The portion is huge to you can definitely split them between a few people. My boyfriend and I both got the fois gras hot dog with truffle mustard. This was awsome! There were so many great looking dogs on the menu. This is a great place to get your hot dog fix. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the wait is ridiculous, at about an hour and a half."
2222,This is the best place for a dog and sausage in Chicago. The service is friendly and fast. If you're a vegetarian they'll make any one of their exotic sausages of the day with a vege dog instead. Just keep in mind when you go there it's cash only my friend.
2223,Wonderful hot dogs!! So many choices....last time I had the veggie dog and it was outstanding........I'd definitely recommend this place even if you have to wait a bit.
2224,What can I say that hasn't been said already? Place is the best.
2225,"All I have to say...duck fat fries! Yum!!!! I used to live in France and even the French don't make fries as good as Hot Doug's. I like mine with mayonnaise. Don't overspend on the specialty sausages like I did: spicy thai and alsacienne w/brie. Go for their regular menu: red hot topped w/everything. Yes, the line winds around the building but it moves pretty fast. PS For parents w/infants, they don't have high chairs (no room) so I kept my son in his stroller and fed him the duck fat fries (he loved them, too). Outdoor seating has a bit more space but good luck getting a table."
2226,"I'll try anything once...and this is one of those places. I won't be spending another Saturday afternoon waiting in line for something that doesn't taste like a piece of heaven. Way over hyped. This is a place for people who have never actually tasted gourmet. -Flavors are not actually inside the sausages, but put on top of the dog...real creative...i.e.cherry sausage, think comstock cherry pie filling on top of a dried out Italian wiener. -Line to get in almost 2 hours. -Only one cashier, Doug who seems unmotivated to make things move along better -Four people making the dogs in the back....I have an idea, 3 guys cooking, two taking orders=20 minute wait... -Not worth the price $8 a dog so that you can eat unusual things like elk, venison, rattlesnake...try your local butcher, they can get you the same types of meat. -Only takes cash, makes you wonder if they pay all of their taxes -The cheese was good, but cold cubed cheese made the dogs feel cold when you got them -Sausages were all dry...Who ever heard of a pork sausage that was dry? -Sausages were small Since I can't give 0 stars, the 1 star is for the hype."
2227,This place is fantastic! Doug your an angel and his cooks are just as beautiful. Vegetarian friendly and taste bud savvy its worth the wait in line. I really wish there were more neighborhood places like this in Chicago.
2228,"Its a great hot dog, but this place is not Alinea. Is it worth a 60-90 minute wait? Not for me, but for others with nothing to do. Dougs is a victim of its own success, lines are good, but his are ridiculously long, as a result, I do not make the trip to this out of the way neighborhood for a hot dog. A Chicago red hot can be had just anywhere. Dougs may be marginally better, just marginally, but certainly not worth the long lines. As Yogi Berra said "" Nobody goes there anymore, its too crowded"""
2229,"Amazing encased meats with regular menu items, specials, and game of the week. The hot dogs and sausages themselves are great and the toppings and sauces are out of this world. I love Doug's business attitude. Totally worth waiting the line that goes around the corner."
2230,"Waited 1.5 hours... worth it!! Foie Gras dog was off the hinges. Even regular dogs were genius. Best hot dogs I have ever eaten in my life. Duck Fat fries were good, but nothing special. Just tasted a bit saltier than normal fries."
2231,The food was good BUT I waited way too long and it wasn't that great for the wait. Like I said the food did taste good but maybe I expected so much more because of the wait and because I saw this place on a tv show? IDK oh and FYI cash only :(
2232,"You've got to admire Doug -- he's doing what he loves (at least he seems like he is), making tons of money doing it (I would assume), and we all benefit! My boyfriend and I went on a weekday at noon (he was off from work) and got some regular hot dogs, a polish, and one weird one. (Pork blue cheese sausage with green apple creme fraiche and toasted almonds.) I actually wasn't a huge fan of the weird one, but I was glad I tried it, and the hot dogs were good. So were the fries. All in all, for me, the ambience and Doug himself, who was so friendly, made the experience. I'll go back to try more of the dogs, but I wasn't overwhelmed on this visit."
2233,I've had some pretty memorable post hangover meals here...the wait seems like it's going to be a lot longer than it actually is but it's totally worth it. It is not your typical Chicago hot dog joint. Let's see there's the duck fat fries which are excellent. And the specials...one of the most unique and wonderful ones i've had was a spicy crawfish sausage...HOLY crap it was delicious.
2234,"Hot Doug's has the perfect corn dog! I know. Who'd get a corn dog with everything else that they have? That's why I get the corn dog as a side dish. The hard part is deciding what to get as my ""main"". There is no doubt that the duck fat fries are tastier than the regular fries. It isn't a mind-blowing difference but it's enough to make you appreciate ducks (more). First timers, don't worry about seating. It magically works out so that you have a seat before your food is out. The staff does a good job of matching groups with appropriately sized tables."
2235,Best place in the city for encased meats. Too bad they're not open for dinner. The wild game sausage is always a good bet. And you can't go wrong with cheese fries. Always worth the trip and the often very long line.
2236,"Oh Hot Doug, I do sometimes miss the old building. Who doesn't enjoy the Sunday NY Times and a Brittany dog near that sunny front window? But thank god you rebuilt, and I'm so happy you did. Just wanted to say thanks for staying in the hood, and for keeping us fat and happy."
2237,"Encased Meat. Made how you like. Fun decor, cool owner, fast service, cash only, duck fat fries on weekends. If you haven't been here yet, I hope you live in another state or are vegan or something, cause otherwise I don't understand why you wouldn't be standing in line RIGHT NOW."
2238,"I love ths place! Doug is always so nice and friendly as he takes your order. The special sausages are always soooo good. And, who doesn't love cheese fries? I love coming here. Beware, the line can wrap around the block!"
2239,"clearly, this is one of those ""places to eat before you die"" joints. three of us came here on MLK monday at 10:30, ready for an hour plus wait. (btw i don't think ANYTHING is delicious enough to wait more than an hour for). luckily we waited about 15 minutes since it was just opening. everything we got was pretty solid. i was afraid the hype of it all would make me hate the place, but luckily the encased meats spoke for themselves. the highlights were definitely the foie gras & duck sausage (of course, a lovely combination!), and the elk sausage (surprisingly not gamey and very delicious! the mustard and cheese combination was yum). the celebrity sausage of the day was a chipotle chicken sausage and was just too smoky for me to the point it was bitter. i was not a fan of those flavors. we also ordered a corn dog and the atomic bomb or something, hello spicy!!!"
2240,"Four and a half stars is spot on. Okay. Yes. the commute is a b*tch and a half... but it's worth it. One might argue that there isn't much you can do with a hot dog to make it ""great,"" and one might be right. You can grill it or you can boil it, and when all is said and done, there just isn't as much room for culinary creativity as say, a rack of lamb. Like the Shake Shack phenomenon in Manhattan, you go to Hot Dougs for the experience. Part of that experience, to the dismay of some who just want to fill their bellies with meat and relish, involves waiting in line. You have to go to Hot Dougs with an open mind (and an empty stomach). I won't deny it, the hot dogs themselves are delicious, as tasty and satisfying as any hot dog I've ever had, but a they are still just wieners on buns, good for 3, maybe 4 bites. The wait in line with other tourists and eager first-timers, the descriptions on the wall menus, and the excitement of finally seeing Doug's smiling face waiting for you at the counter, are what make this a great place to check out at least once. We showed up at 930am (the place opens at 1030) on a sunny, chilly, Saturday morning to find a dozen people already patiently standing outside. By 1030, when the doors opened, the line went back about three blocks. Compared to Shake Shack this is not a long line, but the difference is Doug himself takes your order, and also some spends some time chatting with each customer (and posing for pictures in our case), so the line doesn't move nearly as fast. No problem, you can take this time to read the descriptions of the various hot dogs for sale, as well as a menu of Daily Specials. I went with the Kiera Knightley and the standard hot dog, grilled and boiled, respectively. My girlfriend opted for the standard hot dog, with everything, and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli (I still have no idea what Aioli is), Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. We also got orders of the Duck Fat Fries (which tasted exactly like regular fries). My standard hot dog was very good, well cooked, juicy, and pretty filling. I don't really know how else to describe a hot dog... the Kiera Knightley had a spicy tinge to it, but nothing mouth numbing (I guess she isn't as hot as she used to be). If I'm ever here again I'll try the extra hot ""Selma Hayek"" (too bad they don't offer the Penelope Cruz... cuz DAAAMN). I had a bite of the Foie Gras, which was delicious, but I estimate that one bite was worth roughly $3, which could've gotten me another Kiera/Selma. The staff here is very friendly, and they make sure you don't grab tables until you've gotten your food. The space isn't huge, but you don't feel cramped either, even with a few dozen customers inside and a hundred more out the door. I'd return here again if I am in Chicago, but only if I have nothing else on my schedule. If you are just craving a Chicago style hot dog, then Portillo's in the city is a much quicker bet. One last bit of advice--find someone to drive you, or call a cab for pick-up 15 to 20 minutes in advance. We ended up walking 20 blocks to the subway stop to get back to downtown, since the area is entire devoid of taxis."
2241,"Catching up on some reviews today. My wife and I stopped again at Hot Doug's and it's still as good as ever! We ordered the Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Sir William Pear Cream and Roasted Almonds (always a good choice), the Smoked Portuguese Pork Chourico with Saffron Rouille and Rustico Red Pepper Cheese (Maria thought it was too spicy, she stopped eating it, so guess what..... I got to finish it off yum), the Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Manchego Cheese (it was similar to a gyro, another good sausage Doug), the Swiss Cheese Smoked Pork Knockwurst with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Vintage Van Gogh Cheese (excellent mayonnaise). the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Moody Blue Cheese (this one we saved for later) and the Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Tomme de Savoie Cheese (another reheat for later). Our total bill came to roughly $60 dollars. My only wish is that Hot Doug's wasn't such a far drive. Thanks again Doug!"
2242,this is my personal homage to doug sohn... the food is fantastic...when they have the linquica with saffron rouille and 2 year manchego i cry...it's some of the best food i've had...i bring all my buddies here from outta town to show them what the food in chicago is all about. and doug always remembers me (probably cause i bring him cookies...i dunno)... but i don't need to wax ecstatic. go eat there. now.
2243,The elk dog was unique and very tasty!!! Owner was taking orders and he was consistently very nice to everyone. Its clean but its so small. It was close to full on a Monday at lunchtime. On weekends I have seen the line around the building corner outside. I think they could expand with the amount of hype they have. I do see why people love this place! Only way it could be better is if you knew you could go without a long line.
2244,"This is no ordinary hot dog place. I'm just in love with what they are doing here. It's like raising the lowly hot dog to an art form. It's such a fun little joint. The people who work here really seem like they are having a great time, too. The duck fat fries are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. The hot dogs are all incredible -- you really can't go wrong no matter what you order. Even the music is a little unexpected (Sammy Davis Jr.s The Candy Man!). I didn't mind the line at all. It's worth it once you step inside. Look around and all you see are expressions of joy and hot dog delirium on people's faces."
2245,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place is fantastic! The wait isn't too bad (30-45 min depending on time of day), but by some dining pacing (it is only hot dogs after all), you always get a table by the time you get to the counter and place your order. Doug takes the orders at the counter. Always very friendly and helpful (got to love an owner of a place this successful that still so engaged). We always get 3 dogs (this time, polish, brat, and fire), fries (no duck fat today!) and soda. Best.Dogs.Ever."
2246,Amazing. My fiance and I went there in the dead of winter and still had to wait almost an hour. Between the 2 of us we ordered 6 specialty dogs. Worth the wait and the calories. I wish the lines weren't so long I would go there all the time. Doug is a genius.
2247,"Best hot dogs I've ever had. I've been here twice on my two trips to Chicago and I will honestly feel guilty if I don't come here every trip. I feel like I will be missing something special. I don't care about the lines if I'm getting the best something I've ever had. Here, no worries. This place makes me so happy. Spicy jerk sausage, froie gras dog, Chi dog, garlic dog, duck fat fries, regular fries. Everything, amazing."
2248,"I heard about this place constantly for over a year before coming here for the first time a couple months ago. I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I've worked it into conversation just to think about it some more. I've left work early in order to make it during their hours. I even left work 'sick' once just to sample some alligator. I'm the adventurous type so I tend to order off the specials menu at least and usually get the game of the week. I've had some misses here, the lamb sausage wasn't really my thing, but the hits are hits in a big way and even if you only have one sausage here you've liked it's good enough for the five star rating. The duck fat fries are over-hyped but are tasty, give them a try at least once. Small and short hours keeps the place very busy, be prepared to wait... and wait.... and wait."
2249,Best veggie dog in the US. Hands down.
2250,"this place is insane. coming here in the dead of winter and waiting for a hot dog was not my brightest moment. i believe we waited a little more than an hour... i stopped checking after the one hour mark. this place has gotten extremely popular and they know it. check before you show up due to its strange hours and abrupt closings. they do it bc they can.... and for good reason. the best hotdog of my life. yes. really. i ate 2 of them and had the duck fat fries (fries are good but honestly couldnt tell the difference from other fries). allll good things. docked one star bc i almost lost a toe for this hotdog. come at your own risk. but if you do, i guarantee the best hot dog experience of your existence."
2251,"Came here on a Friday with my boyfriend. It's a bit far from Downtown so it was about a $20+ taxi ride from our hotel. We got there around 2:00 p.m., the line was long, but we decided to hop right in. The person in front of us told us that it was the shortest line he has ever been in and he's been to Hot Doug's five times now. It took exactly an hour to get to the counter to order. Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered five hot dogs and of course the duck fat fries. We got four specialty ones, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Pork Sausage with Roasted Tomato Dijonnaise and Trugole Cheese, Uber Garlic Pork Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise, Blue Marble Jack Cheese and Roasted Garlic Cloves and Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Cajun Shrimp Remoulade and Queso Zamorano AND one off their regular menu, The Dog. The only one that was somewhat of a disappointment was the sun-dried tomato one. It came out a bit dry and didn't have much flavor. All the others were delicious! The duck fat fries were absolutely addicting. No ketchup or any other condiments needed. This was a great experience! Make sure you get there by 2:00 p.m. or else you're kind of cutting it close to closing."
2252,I really like this place. It's a hot dog place where you can get everything from your standard Chicago-style dog to exotic meat products. The duck fat fries are pretty good but I wouldn't call them awesome. Plus it's a fun quirkly little place that's kinda off the beaten path but well worth going to. But be prepared to wait in line out the door.
2253,"Career, marriage, kids...these are all things you do to kill time between trips to Hot Doug's. You will wait in line for a while, but that makes the reward all the more tasty. The duck fries are fantastic, and Doug has yet to serve me an encased meat that I didn't like. It will not be your lowest calorie meal of the day, but it will probably be your most delicious."
2254,It was decent. I just don't get the fuss. The greasy duck fat fries made me sad :(
2255,"second trip to hot doug's, equally as good. here's what i tried: - cognac-infused pheasant sausage with goat cheese and pomegranate-raspberry creme fraiche - duck sausage dog with foie gras and truffle sauce - duck fat french fries (standard) where does he come up with this stuff? as per usual, this is a perfect place to take guests (primarily because it gives me an excuse to go) to experience a uniquely Chicago establishment. we had about a 30-min wait... not too bad."
2256,"Having moved from Chicago, strangely I miss Hot Doug's more than anywhere or anyone else. Please open a shop on the West Coast, Doug! And for those of you lucky bastards who get to enjoy Hot Doug's, get the blue cheese pork sausage if it's ever on the menu and have a bite for me!"
2257,"Don't get me wrong - the hot dogs are goooooood - really good. As are the duck fat fries. Should you go? Most definitely. And, once you've tried it should you go again? Unless you live near by and have been blessed by the line gods and have no wait, no."
2258,This place is one of the gem's in Chicago. Don't let the long line outside intimidate you....it's worth the wait and Doug is always up front ready to take your order. If you're visiting Chicago you definitely want to make a stop at this place. If you're from Chicago then I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about.
2259,"What can I say about the wonder that is Hot Doug's that hasn't already been said? Just plain delicious. It makes me ridiculously happy that I work in Logan Square becasue its a less than five minute drive away. Sure, I've only been there twice but I'm glad to know its there. The specials are where its at. Last time I was there I had a chicken sausage with red peppers and some sort of cheese. Sweet holy mother was that the best sausage I've ever had. Just insanely good. Yes, its crowded, and yes, I had to wait in line outside but it was totally worth it."
2260,"Hot Doug's is for the serious sausage fan. The menu is flawless and the specials are always amazing. I did like the older location better, but the extra few blocks help make up for the duck fat fries (on fridays). Big fan."
2261,"Hot Doug's is awesome! Besides the typical Chicago style dog, they offer all kinds of sausages, with funny names such as The Salma Hayek (which is a spicy andouille sausage). The bratwursts here are really good. They also offer tons of daily/weekly specials, some of them using exotic meats. I tried their Thai spicy chicken sausage, with seaweed salad and this wasabi sauce. It was finger-lickin' good! A few things to note. As other people have mentioned, the hours are a bit odd, so make sure to check before heading over. Also, lines can get pretty long on Fridays and Saturdays. Furthermore, this place is not exactly cheap, so don't expect a bargain (though worth it in my opinion!) Most importantly, this is a cash-only operation, so make sure to bring some cash, since you won't find an ATM within walking distance (plus it would be a real torture to smell all that goodness and drool over the menu, only to realize that you have no cash)!"
2262,"Doug is my dude. He's everybody's dude, apparently. Super nice guy, and he talks with everyone. The line is around the block at his place, and I'm super happy for him because I love anybody with that much positive energy. Had a Chicago dog with a big pickle, a braut, and the Foie Gras dog. Couldn't finish the Foie Gras dog- toodecadent for me- but amazing. On Friday and Saturday he cooks the fries in duck fat, which sounds amazing. Couldn't really tell the difference between them and regular fries- it's not like they taste extra ducky... but they were awesome. thanks Doug! PS I love hot dog store names: Wiener and Still Champion, The Wieners Circle, Super Duper Weeny (in CT)... the list goes on..."
2263,I only went one time and only had enough cash in my pocket for a fire dog and some fries. The attention to detail was wonderful. The hand cut fries were awesome and the chicago style hot dog with all the fixings was exactly how it should be. I will be going back to try some other sausages.
2264,Went on opening time to avoid the queue. Specialty dogs were great and wanted to try everything. Price of regular dogs cheap while specialty dogs were $8 or $9. The order taker and cashier who I assume is Doug was really friendly. My family and dad enjoyed it. Will visit again next time I come back from Manila.
2265,"Well, yeah, it's the best, but it's really in its own category - ""encased meats"", like they advertise. Who can compare to their selection? And it's good that they have that overwhleming advantage, because there are minuses. Far from el and inconvenient in that sense. Expensive. Shitty building/space (why did he bother to move?), just nothing else really all that good about it. However, like I said, for exotic variants on the standard, it has no competition."
2266,"How thankful are we for Doug! He actually makes veggie dogs that don't taste, well, tasteless. They are delicious and perfect! Seriously, he is THE most friendly dude ever."
2267,"I love how this place has $8 hot dogs and they get away with it... I've even tried a few of their special dogs and honestly speaking... I never thought I'd pay more than $2-3 for a hot dog... no matter what kind of meat or cheese was on it. Overall, this place is unique and their dogs are great. Their cheese fries are my favorite... I don't think I've been there without ordering it. A few things that annoys me is that there is : 1. there is a line out the door almost every single day and the wait is close to 30-40 minutes (I timed myself). I went on a really nasty rainy day thinking there wouldn't be a line and to my amazement... the line was still there. 2. It's open from 10-4pm mon-sat. 3. it's cash only. 4. You can easily spend too much money here. Not only are their specialty dogs expensive, but after waiting in that long ass line, you feel the need to make it count. If you don't mind waiting in line for 30 minutes to get a hot dog, definitely go and try it. As for me, the long lines, inconvenient hours, and cash only policy (i never carry cash... I believe in the debit card system) keep me from coming here more often and I live a block away... but maybe the fact that I can't get it whenever I want makes it that much more appealing. Whatever the case, if you haven't tried it yet, make sure you stop by and if you're turned off by the long lines, try going there right around 3:45pm... just don't be late cause they will shut you out."
2268,Had the apple chicken sausage with brie and sweet curry(?) and it was AMAZING! It was my first time there and the place was packed and the employees couldn't have been friendlier and more patient as I was so overwhelmed about what to order. I will definitely be back and already know what I'm trying next!
2269,"Doug is a genius! I can't think of a better way to combine an adventurous eating experience with semi-convenience and a decent price. I say semi- convenience because there is the notorious line outside, but surprisingly, there is available seating inside, thanks to the attentive staff. The price is decent considering the fact that some of these dogs are made of just about anything from rabbit to smoked shrimp. He has the regular menu with more of a streamline fare, but the real deal is the ""out of this world"" specials; these are dogs (technically sausages or emulsified meats) the likes of mandarin orange teriyaki chicken sausage with chili-garlic mayonnaise and butterkase cheese for $7.50. Fries are separate, but come here on a Friday or Saturday and order a generous helping of french fries cooked in duck fat. They're open from 10:30 to 4:00, they're closed on Sundays, and they tend to take most holidays off. For a foodie with out the money and means to experience creative eats, this place hits the spot."
2270,"Having accumulated over 400 glowing reviews, Doug has received a lot of much-deserved hype. Not much to add, except some practical advice: 1. Arrive at either 10AM or 4PM to avoid the thirty minute wait (for a hot dog). 2. There's not a lot of distinction between the regular fries and special duck-fat fries, (to my tongue). 3. It's remarkable how Doug remains so personable, even when dealing with hordes of hot dog demands."
2271,"Encased meat heaven ! I can't believe people are waiting in line when it is -20 F wind chills to eat at this hot dog restaurant. Every type of meat possible including aligator sausage. Even the veggie dog is amazingly tasty and not dry. The experience is unique. I had guests in from overseas and they loved it ! There is a slight feel of the Seinfeld ""soup nazi"" episode as there seems to be a custom or a cult following along with all of the nuances of ordering and eating here. You must go !"
2272,"Yes, Hot Doug's is great. Having people in front of me in line? No, not great. I can't blame it on Doug though or have it tarnish my review. It speaks to his high quality and low prices. The trick is to eat Hot Doug's for a late breakfast BEFORE the lunch rush.."
2273,"This place was all hype. I liked it, but I didn't appreciate the staffs crap attitude and that it's 2010 and its cash only. I made a comment in line about it being cash only and the owner gave me an aggressive lecture about how I must not own a business (which I do) and I wouldn't understand how expensive it is to have a credit card machine. What I do understand is that he's already charging 8 bucks for a decent-at-best hot dog he can prolly take credit cards but chooses not to because cash only makes the taxes look better. This guy is an old school business owner who still thinks its 1980 where he can make short cuts and be fine. The place is okay but the line is not worth the wait."
2274,"Not worth the line, even if there wasn't a line its still not worth it. Their hours are terrible, I'd recommend going somewhere else...trust me."
2275,"Wow! This place is truly awesome! I had heard about this place for several years. Today 5 of us went there, for this special treat. We arrived at 12:50, we waited in line almost exactly an hour. As is usual Doug took our order. He was a pleasure to deal with. Despite it being a typical crazy day he was great. Since this was our first time we wanted to try as many things as possible. So in addition to each of us selecting one we also ordered 3 additional items. Two of us had the foie gras and duck sausage. This was very good. It was incredibly rich. Other items we tried were the Rueben/ tueben hot dog ( my wife loved it, me not so much). We also had the Thai sausage, this was unreal. In addition we had the cheese with chipotle mayo. Really good! The Sonora dog another winner. someone else had the chipotle buffalo sausage, they loved it. Three cheese sausage also good. For $1.50 we had to order a corn dog, fun treat. It was Saturday, we had an obligation to order duck fat fries.........OMG! These were truly a heavenly treat! While not an inexpensive lunch, this place is worth the wait, worth the calories and worth the cost! Chicago is the home of great hot dogs, this is the temple of encased meats! Wait in line, over order and enjoy the hell out of this great culinary experience!!"
2276,"Delicious, authentic, quality Chicago hot dog! Great fries, friendly service - the perfect lunch!"
2277,"I have now taken over 20 out of town people here and they just love the place. Retro feel and a menu board that I get excited for every time I visit. I think the bacon sausage is the best I have tried thus far, however the corn dog is also the best I have had in the city. They changed the cheese sauce for a bit so those fries were off, but they are back to the original blend. Doug reminds me of Elvis Costello and is king and genuine in the way where you wish you could hang out with him in an everyday setting... and without feeling guilty for making the 50 people behind you wait a minute longer."
2278,"Best specialty hot dogs ever! Highly recommend the spicy buffalo w Gouda. However, the special menu changes on a daily basis. Needless to say, a classic steamed chicago dog is always a must. Doug takes great pride in his hot dogs and it clearly shows. This place is a Chicago landmark."
2279,I did indeed break a several year vegetarian streak to eat a rattlesnake sausage here. I regret nothing.
2280,"O man, where does the line start?"
2281,This one's a gimme'. Can we all collectively say that we love Hot Doug's? The guy and the place. Go figure the only recent bad reviews are from some douche New Yorkers. Even better than the food is the concept. Wish I'd thought of that!
2282,"I don't think this is as good as Pink's hot dog in LA. However, I'd give this place 2 thumbs up though. Great place, good food, creative menu, great friendly service. I wish I had a chance to try their duck fat fries. We went on a weekday and they only serve that on weekends. I think they're just discriminating toward Asians who travel on weekdays :) j/k"
2283,"dare i say it... the BEST hot dog place in chicago... yes yes i will every wednesday you will find me here at a table stuffing my face in sheer glory with no shame, and every wednesday i have yet to be disappointed by not only the quality of food but the awsome service. yes hot dougs its true im glad we have found eachother.... when you are closed i shed a tear and when you are open i would stand in a line half way down california just for a veggie dog. you complete me."
2284,"not as if this place even needs to be written about by one more person. but DAYAMN GINA. the hot dogs are incredible. (okay okay, i'm a veggie, but i still love this place.) I ordered my usual, the Chicago (veggie) dog, and added hot giardiniera and sauerkraut this time. the french fries are to DIE for.. they taste like the fresh cut potatoes tossed in hot oil and laid out on brown paper bags, that my grams would make when i was younger. one hot dog is plenty (especially if you order a lot of toppings) and a large fry is ample to share with a friend."
2285,After having Dougs Foi Gras Dog and Duck Fat Fries I.m HOOKED. Just wish I lived a litlle closer.
2286,I love Hot Dougs. The official encased meat of the Windy City Rollers!
2287,"When I was a kid, I hated hot dogs; soft, flimsy, tasteless, cheap snacks they passed off on the non-discriminating kids. An Oscar Myers laid in a potato roll was O.K. for a neophyte, but I just could not stomach it. The boundary between sausage and roll was indiscernible and the taste homogenous. I know they paid that chubby kid tons to sing so happily of crappy meat products on T.V. Then in my later years and owing to work, I had the good fortune to work with Vienna Beef, hot dog central of Chicago. At Vienna and in Chicago, the hot dogs are a world apart from home. Out there sausages are crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The extras too, are different and ketchup nearly never used. The loaded Chicago hot dog is topped with onions, electric green pickle relish, sport peppers, tomato slices, a dill pickle spear and celery salt. Wow! Since we got the condo in Irving Park, I have been dying to get to the Zagat rated 25, HOT DOUGS. FROM ZAGAT Carnivores ""wait in line"" at Doug Sohn's ""legendary encased-meats emporium"", where there's ""more seating"" and better parking than at his original haunt but the same ""lousy hours"" (the kitchen closes at 4 PM); rest assured, though, that ""it's worth"" it for his ""outrageously decadent sausage sandwiches"", including more than a dozen ""gourmet hot dogs"" - no, it's ""not an oxymoron"" - ranging from ""rabbit"" to ""rattlesnake""; P.S. he ""puts the fry in Friday with his duck-fat fries"" (available on Saturday too). So when in Chicago early on a Friday, I mapquested the place and after scribbling on a pack of matches, set off for the ""emporium."" At 1.9 miles it seemed walkable. I traveled it in Google Earth, but some 30 minutes into the walk, I figured it might have been more than I had been up for. I then planned to take a cab home. I travel down Waveland, down Addison FOREVER passing the Mirabelle a German restaurant we found last Winter. An aroma of sauerkraut drifted from the back kitchen door as a blue van drove up, dropping off authentic German suds. Finally, to California St, past the White Castle and Com Ed, I could see it in the distance. And too the line. Hot Doug's is about twice the size of a Subway and people lined the store out the door and down the street. It was hot and there were 2 vestibules of increasingly cooler air inside. After 20 minutes I made it into the inner sausage sanctum and to the menu board. CASH ONLY! The regulars were hot dog, Brats, Thuringer, Veggie, Hots, $2-3 and then the ""specials board."" Here the selection where more elaborate with Atomic Rib Eye, and Garlic, Pork Catalonian. These fetching about $7-9. I only had a twenty. Yeeks! As it was Friday, duck fat fries were to be had at $3.50. WOW! I signed on for the fries, the Thuringer and spending away cab fare, the Catalonian Pork. I got them loaded. The Thuringer came ""Chicago style"" and the Catalonian with mustard and grated Asiago cheese. A taste of the Catalonian, sent me skyward. Truly, the best sausage I have ever had! The ""Marty Allen"" Thuringer nearly as good was the second best ""encased meat"" of my life. The fries good, pailed to the links. It was cab fare well spent. Belly full I enjoyed my lengthly walk home feeling like I had been to Heaven and back."
2288,"Not that Hot Doug's needs an 82nd rave review, but I was so moved by my first visit there yesterday that I can't stop thinking about it. I did a special -- pork catalano with goat cheese and chipotle sauce (on a poppy seed bun, of course) and it was truly to die for. And I love that Doug himself still is the guy taking your order. Success hasn't gone to his head, apparently."
2289,"a prerequisite to eating at hot doug's is a medical exam from a professional doctor stating that your heart can withstand their delicious sausages. i was finally able to eat at hot doug's in the summer when he returned to work after his fall. before then, i would drive by hoping that the restaurant was opened like a stalker. i had to have his sausage! i've heard great things and i wasn't disappointed. and coincidently, i went on a friday and tried their delectable fries fried in duck fat. did i say fried? delicious!"
2290,Encased meat emporium. Doesn't get any better.
2291,"A friend teased me for weeks, telling me that he would take me to Hot Doug's. We set a lunch date, invited some other people, and make the long journey out there from the loop during a work day. Needless to say, we took a 90 minute lunch, gorged on duck fries. I had the greek lamb dog and a green river. Yeah, it is a really bad combination, but I got excited and couldn't help myself."
2292,"An hour wait to get into a hot dog joint, it better be a damn good hot dog joint ... It is. In fact it is probably the best if only for it's uniqueness. Finally tried the fois gras sausage, good but why order it again when there is so much else here to try. The duck fries are some of the best fries I've had. The bacon sausage was great, an absolute treat. Gotta make it less than 3 years between visits to this place."
2293,This is why I moved to Avondale.
2294,"i love you, doug. i love you, justin. i love you, girl who's name i don't remember but all my friends have a crush on. i love you, dudes making dogs in hard hats. i love you."
2295,"I went to Hot Doug's with my good friend Windy City Roller Nina Millimeter on my wedding weekend, and I had the Mole Chicken Dog with Mexican Cheese on it. It was spicy, savory, salty, and totally delicious -- and, to use my Aunt Caren's word, ""Tongue-asmic!"" Seriously, it was the best tasting thing I've had besides my wedding cake the whole time I've been in Chicago, and it managed to wipe away ALL the stress of the wedding planning AND staying with the in-laws for 2 weeks. Doug is a culinary rock star, and his cased meats make my heart sing!!!"
2296,"In-freaking-credible. All the sausages but the elvis were gluten free. so I helped my self to two dogs sans the bun. the duck fat fries were insane. SO GOOD! Doug, the owner, was very friendly and still had a warm disposition and demeanor at the end of a long day. we stood in line for a little over an hour, but it was worth it. My hubby got the foie grais and said it was orgasmic. By brother got a dog with chili, but we are from Detroit...and we think of chili two ways:chili dog chili and ""chili"" and the chili a really good ""chili"" not ""hot dog chili"" ( it had beans) so it was, in his opinion ""delicious, but inappropriate"""
2297,"Most definitely one of my FAVORITE spots in Chicago. I love trying the specials, which are like gourmet hot dog creations, and the duck fat fries are SO good. Service is fast, everything's reasonably priced, and this place never fails to please. I make sure to stop by Hot Doug's at least once every couple of months, and I totally want to befriend Doug who seems like the coolest guy."
2298,"Every hotdog I eat here is the best hotdog I've ever eaten. It's like a gourmet meal. There's always a line when we go, but it's always worth the wait."
2299,"I watched as firefighters fought the blaze when the original Hot Doug's on Roscoe was burning down. Figuring the dogs inside were well-done, courtesy of a the 4-alarm fire, I rushed toward the smoldering front door to save the encased meats within. Fortunately, the firemen held me back. I lived to see another day and Hot Doug established new roots on California, where I once downed the most delicious steak-dog ever created. From the flames rose a Phoenix!"
2300,"I don't want to belabor the point. It's good. Go for the unique stuff or you may be disappointed. I mean, why wait in line for just a polish (called ""Elvis"" here) or a Chicago Dog (called ""The Dog"" here). Lots of good stuff, and even though there is a long line on any given day, be social! The crowd is fun. Oh, and check the website before you go. Sometimes the man needs a day off. Cash only."
2301,"omg i love hot doug's. i think i have eaten here 5 or 6 times now and continue to go back for more. (i think we're going back on saturday and i am getting hungry just thinking about it.) i have to say, i've never gotten a regular hot dog here; i always go with my fiance and we split three of the specials and we have never been disappointed. they have all been amazingly delicious, even the ones i thought i wouldn't like. the variety is just incredible; where else can you eat a hot dog made out of antelope, buffalo, venison and elk as well as a duck sausage covered with foie gras and truffle aioli? i am notorious for my hatred of lines and my refusal to wait more than 10 minutes or so for just about anything. i don't mind waiting for hot doug's because it is THAT GOOD. (if you can go early on a non-duck fat weekday, you will have a shorter wait, but in my opinion it is worth it to try the duck fat fries at least once!) the line also helps ensure that you will get a seat once inside the restaurant, where you can feast upon your tubes of meaty deliciousness at your leisure. also, doug himself has taken our order every time we've eaten here, and he is a friendly and personable guy! so there is really no reason not to pay hot doug's a visit. just go already!"
2302,Amazing. I can't say anymore. The line is well worth it. Just wait and try something new. You won't be sorry.
2303,"Enough said. This place has the best damn hot dogs/sausages. I chowed down on three sausages in 5 minutes, it was so good that I couldn't let it sit out in the cold like that, just can't, that would be sinful. We were in line for 30 minutes and yes, it's worth every minutes in the cold. The item that stood out the most for me? the duck sausage with the foie gras, it's orgasmic, no lie. The fries fried in duck fat was so so, I couldn't tell a difference from the regular fries."
2304,"omg i crave for this stuff at least twice a week! yes, it's a pain to wait in line for a hot dog. but this is no ordinary hot dog. this is hot doug. this man is a genius. it's so orderly, and the guy is so awesome! everything is just 5 stars for me! i had my first game meat [elk] for the first time, and it wasnt so bad! my favorite was actually spicy jamaican. had duck fat fries and it was delicious! oh man, if only california had this. i would be soooo happy. doug, would you come to california???"
2305,Went here yesterday....my 5th time....but it feels like the first....mmmmm!!! Had the Spicy Thai Sausage and the Toulouse Sausage. It is amazing what refined and complex taste can be worked into an encased meat Doug you are an artist and a true patriot of your craft!
2306,"Fortunately, when I came here I didn't have to wait too long in line. I decided to order the Italian sausage special along with small fries and a small fountain drink, which came out to be a flat $10. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the sausage with the chopped up feta cheese and tomatoes. I'll have to come back and try out their other specials."
2307,"I LOVE HOT DOUGS. I don't ever mind waiting, either. Totally worth it. The only thing that sucks about waiting is hearing all the newbs in the line talk about Hot Dougs just because they saw it on 'No Reservations'. Anyway, all the hot dogs are ill, and the duck fat fries are worth 5 stars alone. I love the kooky hot dog decor and everyone that works there is really nice. The ONLY thing that bums me out about Hot Dougs is when I go there on a random day when they are supposed to be open and its CLOSED. TOTAL BUMMER, DOUG."
2308,"It's a very popular place and if you go on a nice day, especially a Saturday, you should expect a long (~2 hr) wait. Stop your whining. The website is extremely up-to-date and accurately reflects the day's menu. The duck fat fries are good to try once, but they're really nothing to write home about. I don't feel compelled to try them again after the first time. Obviously, you can go there to get a regular hot dog or brat, but that's really a waste of a trip. If you're going to wait in line for over an hour, at least get something you really can't get anywhere else. They're great at incorporating really unusual meats into their sausages. I've had rattlesnake, kangaroo, ostrich, bear, alligator, etc. Some of the aiolis/mustards/mayos are kinda weird (strawberry mustard is definitely a no-no), but overall the food is solid and Doug is awesome."
2309,"Seriously motherfucker, seriously. Any day of the week! I just wish you were open more than 225 days/year!"
2310,"Well worth the wait! Hot Doug's is Chicago's pride in an area of Chicago pride! I would recommend everything. Seriously. This place is great. My only issue is that it seems to always be closed. I feel like it should cut it's customers a little slack on the tight time frame that it is governed by. But if you can get there when it is open, you are in for a treat."
2311,"Absolutely Orgasmic. I waited in line for 2 hours, and yes, it was worth it. I'm going back tomorrow...and probably the next day, and the day after. Simply genius."
2312,"So after reading all the reviews and all the comments about hot dougs I finally decided to venture out and try it. I was well prepared for the wait and it wasn't necessarily as bad as I thought but in the end I think we waited about 1 and a half hours by the time we were out it was a good two hours just to get the hot dogs. I don't know if my expectation was just too high or I'm just missing something. The room was crowded after we ordered so we just decided to take it to go. I was super excited for the duck fat fries everyone talks about so I tried one right as they gave me the order. Wait..... I don't get it. It tasted like regular fries. I'm not sure why they were so special. Maybe they gave us the wrong fries but I don't know. They were just simply.... fries. Better than mcDonalds but not special enough for me to wait that long for. I thought well okay, I should try the hot dogs before I judge. So I went back to a friends place to try them. We got the Applewurst and the game of the week which was a buffalo dog with ale and some other things. Our ultimate conclusion was that the hot dogs were special. As it unique but definitely not something I would want to wait in line for almost 2 hours to get. It was an experience for me I'm not exactly amazed by the dogs but now I've tried it I don't think I'll be going back."
2313,"So good. I waited in line with my buddy yesterday. I had a rattlesnake sausage hotdog and a cherry/pork hotdog with bacon-infused chocolate for a topping. omg. so delicious. duck fat fries, too, because it was friday (saturday they have them, too). definitely waited 45 minutes for it, but it was well worth every second of it."
2314,"While we all know that Hot Doug's is amazing, I feel we must also acknowledge the fact that Kangaroo just shouldn't be consumed by anyone. Damn you, little Jackalope, with your exotic encased meat hawking chalkboard."
2315,"It's good...but come on now. This is clearly the ""herd AND heard' mentality going on here..."
2316,"Been here 5 times. Shortest wait: 45min with chilly, drizzly weather. Longest wait: 1hr 45min. But only have been here after 2p each time. If you want a quick hot dog, this is not your place. BUT if you are willing to make the wait and wait 2+ dogs, it is so worth it. First off, this is a hot dog emporium, so if you're not a hot dog fan, you'll probably think an hour-long wait is absurd. For the hot dog lovers, however, this is heaven. Chicago style is always great, I love the fois gras sausage, it is one tasty work! yums My favorite, however, is the fire dog. Not really spicy at all, but has a nice zing. Duck fat fries are indeed good, i mean not as ""amazing"" as I would have thought, but pretty worth it!! I just love the fact that when you are ordering, the owner (the guy who takes your order) doesn't rush you to order even though there's like 50 people waiting behind you. You get the full treatment I would say. He always seems to be in a super good mood like the owner of The Max in ""Saved by the Bell."""
2317,I love the food here but it only gets 4 stars because it has the stupidest hours of any restaurant I know.
2318,"We were there on a Thursday at 1pm and it was a 10 minute line--but when you get to the counter, Doug makes you feel like you're the only person in the joint. Great food, amazing prices--and Doug is just awesome--no wonder he's been featured on so many Food Channel/ Travel Channel shows. If we could eat here everyday we would! It's cash only--so bring the greens."
2319,The penultimate hot dog and sausage experience. It was the highlight of my weekend visit to Chicago. Will go back any and every time I get a chance. The duck fat fries are a must.
2320,Not bad. The gourmet dogs (ribeye & lamb) weren't sock rockin. The original was my favorite. We went at 1 pm on a Monday & only waited 15 min. I wouldnt wait an hour to eat here though. CASH ONLY
2321,"Long lines but good dogs "") I liky"
2322,"So nobody should be whining about the wait and giving this place fewer stars because of it. For God's sake, you can't help that the stuff is SOOOO good that it creates an insane demand. So somehow, on the way home from the airport, I whiz by at 1215p on a Wednesday and there's NO LINE. You're kidding me. They had to have run out or they're closed or there's a shooting inside. None of the above. So here's my chance and my wife will hate me because she always wants to go except for the line. I get inside and there's one person ordering before me. I peruse the menu and want EVERYTHING in there... except for the regular hot dog because for God's sake, you can get that down the street. So I double up and get the Dave Kingman (Chicken sausage, Santa Fe style) and get a special dog of Marsala and Roasted Garlic Wild Boar Sausage with Anchovy-Parsley Goat Butter and Black Pepper Affinois Cheese. HOLY CRAP. I nearly died of a pleasure heart attack. The meat was outta sight great and it was clear that these were prime cuts and fresh. Not the scrap that hits the chopping block to fill the sausage sleeve. Because I couldn't resist, I ordered a small fries as well. Polished it all off. The fries were fresh cut, crisp and hot. Just the way they should be, unlike a number of the local brethren's sloppy grease sticks. I only wish I could have eaten more and been able to transport the little lady in for some as well. I will not buy a lottery ticket because a trip to Hot Doug's without a line is a once-in-a-lifetime situation. BTW, I would wait an hour plus for this again."
2323,"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before? It's really that awesome. I am a vegetarian about 99% of the time but I just can't resist this place. I have had the Rattlesnake, the Alligator, the Kiera Knightley and about 5 or 6 other. My fave is definitely the Swiss Pork Weisswurst with Vincent Van Gogh cheese. It melted in my mouth and was nothing short of amazing. If you get here before noon on the week days the lines aren't bad. You will still wait but not nearly as long, about 15-20 minutes at top. They serve fries cooked in duck fat on the weekend and the wait is painfully long. I stuck it out once just to try them and have to say that I won't wait that long again. I really couldn't tell the difference. Whether its your first time in Chicago or you are a local, definitely give Hot Doug's a chance."
2324,"It was well worth the hour wait in line! Very affordable and quick. You have to try the duck fat fries. Its crispy, thin, and pretty tasty. The employees there were real nice esp the one guy that was cleaning up and helping people find a table! Great sense of humor. Love the decorations and how the menu was set up! I'll be sure to stop by here again when I'm in Chicago!"
2325,The best hot dog place on planet Earth. Doug is culinary genius. Don't waste your time with traditional dogs and sausages. Instead go for Doug's signature items like the Cranberry Pheasant Sausage with Port-Cherry Mustard and Smoked Gouda Cheese or the Applewurst Smoked Pork Sausage with Sweet Curry Mustard and Goat Cheese. Doug will change the way you think about hot dogs.
2326,"Stopped in to see how Doug and his delicious wieners were doing. I tried the tuben which was a Ruben hot dog. Holy crap was it good. It came with Russian dressing and sour crout. I have also tried the buffalo dog, the Thuringer, the classic Chicago style dog, chili cheese dog, and a corn dog. If I had to make one recommendation it would be, DON'T PLAY IT SAFE, because whatever you decide will be the best hot dog you have ever had, and why not be adventurous."
2327,"This is the best place in the world to get any sort of ""encased meat"" you can think of. The service is incredible. The soda selection is great. Everything about this place is amazing. You have to go if you like hot dogs at all. It is always fun to go in there and try a new sausage that you've never had before."
2328,"All I can say is, I love Hot dogs, therefore I love Hot Doug's. :)"
2329,"I'm probably one of the few people who is reviewing this place who does NOT like rattlesnake, wild boar or any other kind of meat for my hot dog-I like the basic stuff. That said, I think it was the best hot dog I've ever had."
2330,Thank you Doug. I have another reason to visit Chicago.
2331,"waited two hours on a hot day for duck fat fries and ""encased meats."" doug is as charming as ever, but i guess i'm just not a sausage enthusiast. that's right - sausage. 99% of the things on the menu are sausages, not hot dogs. only hot dog on the menu is a chicago-style, and you can find one just as good at any of the other chicago hot dog haunts without waiting two hours. and if someone hadn't told me i was eating duck fat fries, i wouldn't have known it. good, but not the best fries i've had on earth. i'm glad i went once for the experience, but i won't be back. but to be fair, if sausages are really your thing, you will like this place."
2332,"As you step into this establishment after your long wait in line, you begin to understand the love and pride the owner has lavished on his premises. The decorations - from the wall detailing the history of encased meats to the wienerized ""American Gothic"" mural in the woman's bathroom - are eclectic but all paying homage to almighty and adored encased meats. Even there is a considerable line up outside, Doug himself always makes a point of greeting each customer with the same care, energy, enthusiasm as he does for the one prior which is no small feat. He even recognizes the people before us who came the day before for the first time and banters with them as they place their order for the day. He never batted an eye at our mildly insane order of 3 hot dogs each with duck fries on top of that. Seating is plentiful surprisingly given the long line-up around the restaurant so you can relax inside or out in the patio around the corner of the restaurant. 1)Antelope Sausage with Berry-Cherry-Rum Sauce and Sartori Raspberry Cheese - my personal favorite - the rich rum sauce combined with the sweetness of the fruit and meat mixed with a little sharpness of cheese... you can taste the love. 2) Cognac-Infused Lamb and Pork Sausage with Spinach Raita and Pecorino Pepato Cheese - a little disappointing. Not enough lamb flavour in the sausage, personally. The raita is a bit bland. Would have been better if it was a lamb sausage with garlic spinach yogurt sauce or something. 3) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris - the king of them all - The foie matched well with the truffled aioli and sausage. Delicious, luxurious - yes... it is as good as all the hype and well worth the wait. My fiance loved this dog! 4) Swiss Cheese Smoked Knackwurst with Smoked Paprika Mayonnaise and Smoked Provolone Cheese - Smoky, earthy matches well with the paprika. Was definitely burping up the smoky flavor many hours after ingestion. 5) The Chicago Dog - classical preparation - delicious - sweet, salty, crunchy. Delectable and less than $2 - a much better deal and better tasting than the dogs you get on the street venders (who charge you $3.50). 6) Elk sausage 7) Duck fat fries (available only Fri/Sat) - not enough duck fat to really get the flavor into the fries. Who cares though - really - the fries are secondary to the real focus here which is the encased meats. So for those of you thinking about braving the 1.5-2hour wait, know that there is a wait here for a very good reason - the food is excellent, the atmosphere is warm and the service is friendly."
2333,"Love the dogs! We were in line for about 45 minutes, but could totally understood the wait. Everything was cook to order and fresh. We had 3 gourmet hot dogs (Foie gras, spicy sausage, and something else) plus the classic Chicago style hot dog. They were all good with the Chicago style being the best. Trust me, I always eat hot dogs with nothing but ketchup, but I am now a fan of the Chicago style. Thanks to Doug!"
2334,What's left to say? It's worth the wait. You can get sausages here you can't get anywhere else. The duck sausage with foie gras and truffle mayo is easily the best hot dog/sausage I've ever had.
2335,"awesome sausage dogs. my group had the rattlesnake sausage, the duck sausage with foi gras, the buffalo sausage and their veggie dog. all very different from your Chicago dog but excellent in quality and taste. the duck sausage was very good! it's about $7-9 per so be ready, this place only accepts cash money yo. we also had the duck fat fries, they were crispy and very good, they won't taste like duck but the oil makes them a little greasier, yummy. get here earlier there is always a long arse line. checkout my photos."
2336,Is everyone missing the obvious? Its a hot dog in a bun. I have been to Hot Dougs twice the 1st time after we closed on our condo and our real estate agent kept raving about the place. Then I went for lunch to see if maybe I missed something the first time. Nope! Its still a hot dog on a bun. I guess the different sausages are interesting but overall I could ditch the line and get a good hot dog just down the street from where I live. I don't think the third time would be the charm so I will not be back. Come on people a line for Hot dogs. What's next?
2337,"hooooomyhotdoggoodnesssssss!! when caty k. & reese t. were in town, they insisted we visit hot doug's- and i thank them for it. im going to skip to the good stuff- the dogs. i had the salma hayek, which is a little bit spicy and crazy delicious. friends brought back a variety of dogs and we passed them around to taste them all! my favorite was the salma, but the mountain man was a close second. chomp chomp. i am an absolute sucker for anything w/goat cheese, so the mountain man made me very happy! like caty k. said, there was a heck of a wait on a tuesday at 11am- so i cant even begin to imagine what it's like there on the weekends. if you can, go on an off time...but at some point, if you're in chicago...you should go! its the most inventive, delicious hot dog place out there!"
2338,"We had the foie gras dog, some sort of mushroom dog special, and the duck fat fries. The duck dog was delicious, the foie gras was a little over the top but hey if the option's available, you gotta try it. The foie gras wasn't the best I've had, I think this dog would be better with grilled onions on top instead. The mushroom dog was delicious. I wish I paid more attention to what was actually in it. The duck fat fries were great. I had to give this place 3 stars because the standing in line in the cold was not fun. I not really a stand outside in the cold kind of girl for any kind of food. This place is good, but it's not a 45 minute wait good let alone 2 hrs."
2339,"If I was a Death Row Inmate and had a choice of where to eat my last meal, this would be the place. Can happiness be had in tubular meat? Oh yes, it can. You usually have to stand in line for a while, because there are many people who come here to eat their way to hot dog nirvana. But you know what? These are happy people standing in line. And Doug? You are the man. Long may you and your fried in duck fat fries live in infamy."
2340,"Um, awesome. Had the pleasure of this local experience while out on business. I still dream about it. Damn cravings that originate in another time zone!"
2341,"Well, I saw Hot Doug's on the travel channel like two years ago and thought ""Hm, looks tasty, if I'm ever there I'll check it out."". I just moved here (Chicago area) about a month ago and decided to go. It was AMAZING!!!!!!!! The best sausage, maybe, anything that I have ever tasted. I'm going back again on Friday!"
2342,This place is as good as everyone says- the kind of place that makes me wish I was unemployed so I could come on weekdays and avoid the line.
2343,"I can't believe I lived at my current place, which is withing 5 minutes of walking to Hot Doug's, for 2 years now and only today I had the chance to stop by! I pass in front of this place daily and never fail to see the line down the block. So today was the same of course...but the line actually moves quicker than one might think. I just ordered a regular Chicago style hot dog with everything in it, and of course the cheese fries! I think I should have ordered 2 of them though, because one definitely wasn't enough for me. It was so delicious I could eat even 3! It's a very friendly place that delivers fast and great service."
2344,"Is there a Doug or is it just, like, the fancy French pronunciation of dog? Either way, doesn't matter. Had this Catalanian pork sausage with this cheesy sauce on top AND the Paul Kelly AND my friends and I split cheese fries. What the hell were we thinking. It was too much. But in the immortal words of Mae West, too much of a good thing can be wonderful. And in this case, it was."
2345,"I wish I could have tried more of the hot dogs. The jerk chicken one with plantain stuff on top was FANTASTIC. The thai one with peanut sauce tasted like a too spicy sausage with peanut butter on it. Not as good. But still, it was very yummy and I hope to go back and try some more! Especially on a weekend when I can get the duck fat fries!"
2346,"It has been a year since my one and (sadly) only trip to Hot Doug's, but I continue to proselytize to everyone and anyone that I can corral into conversation, regardless of the topic. I came down from Madison last year around this time to experience May Fest with my old college friends as a reciprocal to Bockfest at the Capital Brewery. Friday night was a tour of the bars in Bucktown, and Saturday morning was not the best I've ever felt. My friend tells me to get dressed because we're driving to a hot dog restaurant and we'll likely have to wait for a half hour or more. I frankly wasn't too excited, because my opinion was that nothing is worth waiting that long, let alone a frickin' hot dog. Obviously, I stand corrected. We picked up a few people on the way and parked near some nondescript bungalows and low-slung industrial buildings. I thought we were in the wrong place, but there at the corner was a small building with a line of people out the door and around the side. It took us about 45 minutes to get up to the counter, all the while my friends and other people in line kept telling me how great of an experience I was in for. Against this kind of build-up I figured there would be a bit of a come-down. It turns out this was not the case at all. At first I had planned on being conservative in what I chose, but as I waited in line my courage grew and I ended up with the Game of the Week, which was an elk sausage with a smooth French cheese made with bacon and topped with a spicy Dijon mustard. As my conservative ""back-up"" I went with a steamed Chicago dog, and we all split an order of the duck fat fries. Since I was going all out, I got a can of the Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray celery soda. It was, without exaggeration, one of the most enjoyable meals of life. The elk sausage with the bacon-flavored cheese and mustard was the perfect combination of spicy and savory, and the texture of the sausage was exactly right, balanced by the smoothness of the cheese. The duck fat fries were exemplary - perfectly fried and salted, hot right out of the fryer. The Chicago dog was last, and honestly I can't say that I really remember it other than being very good. At that point I was a bit mind-blown, since despite everyone touting the praises of this place my expectations were actually exceeded. Oh, and it turns out that I really like Cel-Ray too. A year later I still find myself raving about the place. Yeah, it's as great as everyone says. Obviously everyone knows this, hence the number of reviews. But I still think about detouring there every time I come down the Kennedy, and I have determined that, if anyone wants to go, we could leave Madison by 9 and be there by lunch."
2347,"Oh man, since I moved to San Francisco I have missed Hot Doug's something fierce. The regular menu is excellent, but the weekly specials are the best. Always worth the wait, no matter how long the line is, rain or shine. Small inside, but Doug manages the customer flow really well so there are always tables ready when your food comes."
2348,"Being that I'm a regular, I wonder to myself, why has it taken so long to write a review? I am a HUGE Chicago hot dog fan. I've eaten at all of the most popular joints in Chicago, and have had hot dogs all over the world. However, the one place I keep returning to, is Hot Doug's. Granted, the last time I was there on a Friday, I had to wait an hour to get my food, it was worth it. The service is friendly and quick (lines is slow, but food is ready shorty after ordered), and no matter how busy they are, Doug has always asked how I was doing, and was very friendly. Also, even at their busiest, I've always found a place to sit after I ordered. The variety of hot dogs toppings, and sausages are fantastic, as well as the quality, and consistency. The duck fat fries are a great treat, although I love their regular fries as well. Just do it...the 1809 reviews don't lie (well, the ones that gave it less than 5 stars are)"
2349,The best hot dog place. Ever.
2350,"This place is the best. Period. The dogs are not the quintissential Chicago-salad-on-a-bun (although you can order one). The dogs are simply the finest in creative, delicious, encased meats. I had a sausage made out of bacon, topped with herbed butter and fried battered onion bits. I've had fries, fried in delicious duck fat. I had a sausage made of rattlesnake, and it was good! Don't be scared though you scardy cats, there are delicious corn dogs and normal dogs too. Come here on a weekday if you can, the line is out the door on weekends. Hours are kind of strange, but this is the best 'dog place in the city."
2351,"I only went here once so I'm not sure if I can actually claim to ""miss"" this place, but I do! Hot Doug's is everything great about Chicago dining - quirky, fearlessly experimental, fresh quality ingredients, and the food is made with lots of love. And it's veg friendly! I love the pickle spear served in the standard hot dog. Ahh, Doug's. Totally coming here when I visit!"
2352,Duh. Hot Doug's is amazing. One of the places (like Kuma's corner) I bring anyone visiting chicago. Thank you for duck fat fries and rabbit sausage.
2353,"Went to Hot Dougs @ Lulas yesterday, I almost died. There aren't any descriptions that will help you make the choice to go, just go."
2354,If you only go once in your life make sure it's for the duck fries made on Fridays only!! The hotdogs are freaking fabulous even if you order the regular dog or the Salma Hayke Dog it's delicious. Just do NOT forget the fries made in duck fat... yummy! Oh and another thing this place takes cash only!!
2355,"I couldn't decide which place I liked better- Hot Doug's or Portillo's. I would probably say the chicago dog at Portillo's was better, but the vibe and decor at Hot Doug's takes it all. There are daily specials and duck fat fries, they even name hot dogs after celebrities (one of them was named Britney Spears but due to her recent debauchery was changed to some other celebrity hahah). The guy at the counter was cool and he sounded like the moviefone guy. However, the fries (not the duck fat fries) were nasty and the hot dog was smaller than I expected. And why would you close before 4pm??? That's when people get off work!"
2356,Can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. There is a reason for the hype and the long lines - these dogs are freaking good. Get the bacon dog!
2357,"keep it up doug! any restaurant owner that is the face of their business by working at it day in and day out is cool with me. yeah there are lines, but you just have to go with that expectation. don't plan on being somewhere in an hour. just go, relax, and enjoy a chicago original. i've had a bunch here and not all of the crazy specials are amazing. but the fries and the BLT put me in heaven. somehow doug has a sausage that tastes like bacon. and it's not like the sausage has little bacon bits in it. it's the consistency or a brat, but tastes like bacon. add some tomato, avocado-may and lettuce, and you have the hot doug's BLT. AMAZING!!! i make sausage myself and I will be trying to achieve this feat for probably the rest of my life. genius. pure genius."
2358,"This place is AWESOME. If I lived in Chicago, I'd come here all of the time. I had the standard ""dog"" grilled - which is so delicious grilled. And so cheap! Under $2. I also couldn't help myself and ordered the foie gras dog, which melted in my mouth and was yummy beyond belief. The two boys I was with were overjoyed by this place and ate a ton of sausages. Make sure you look up the daily ""specials"" menu and snag one of those. Fries were delicious too although I was sad they weren't rendered in duck fat like I had heard. Turns out this is only done on the weekends. In addition to true deliciousness, Doug actually is the person who takes your order. He does it pleasantly, is super kind, and doesn't try to oversell you. For the three of us, he advised only one order of fries. THANK YOU! Two would have been way too many. He also encouraged us to walk around the corner to the outside garden area, which was super cute. We had our food delivered right to the table. Don't be turned off by the long line wrapping around the corner. It moves quickly and regardless, this place is well worth the wait. Doug - please bring your deliciousness to other US cities ASAP!"
2359,"umm. amazing. i could probably just end the review right there. just two words. but i won't. max and i finally made it to hot dougs a couple of days ago. we went around 2pm on tuesday. there was still a line out the door, but it didn't take too long. we were able to order within about 15 minutes. since it's kind of out of the way and i wasn't sure how often we'd make it there, we ordered a little of everything. i wanted everything on the menu but we limited ourselves to 5 dogs and cheese fries to share. my favorite was the special. it was wild boar with smoked gouda and some sort of chipotle sauce. absolutely great. we also had the marty allen (beef, pork and garlic) and another one i can't remember. we ordered the classic chicago dog and the corn dog too. i had to see how they handled those classics. everything we ate was amazing. the corn dog and chicago dog were both the best of each i have had. but i would recommend getting some of their specials over them just because the specials are so unusual and great. i would absolutely recommend eating here if you haven't already or going back if you have."
2360,"36 min in line. No seats. $16 for a hot dog, fries and a drink. Ate outside on the curb. MAN! ... Well worth it."
2361,"If you are in to gourmet sausages, Hot Doug's is the place for you. Make sure you are ready to wait in line for periods of up to 2 hours outside. It's worth the wait people. Doug has the usual staple dogs on the menu and also rotates his specials on a weekly basis. There are many flavors to choose from and haven't had a sausage that I didn't devour yet."
2362,"Holy f#$%. As Neil Diamond sang in ""Sweet Caroline"", when I think of Hot Doug's, I think, SO GOOD, SO GOOD, SO GOOD. I had the portabella sausage with brie, bleu cheese sausage with pear creme fraiche and almonds, and duck fat fries. Duck fat fries, they reminded my taste buds of when McDonald's used to fry their french fries in trans fat. It was delicious, you can't find french fries like that anywhere in CA anymore - and I'm something of a french fries connoisseur. It was so worth the 45 minute wait in the Chicago cold."
2363,"Another place I've only been to once but I still have wet dreams about. Foie gras dog? Yeah probably the best ""hot dog"" I've ever had. The Chicago dog I had was easily one of the best I've ever had as well. I still need to experience the duck fat fries, so I guess my testimony for Hot Doug's is a bit lacking. But at least I know that I need to return. Soon."
2364,"I LOVE Hot Doug's!!! They have some of the best veggie Chicago dogs in the city, so my boyfriend and I aren't left high and dry when we take our out-of-town friends and family here to try out all the specialty dogs. Yeah, the cash-only policy's a bit of a drag. But at least I've had good luck in the timing department and never had to wait in line for longer than 15 minutes."
2365,"I have been to Hot Doug's several times, and it has always been excellent. If I had just one place to go in Chicago, this would be it for me."
2366,I've been a couple of times. It's totally worth the wait.
2367,"update: seriously! you don't want to wait forty minutes, do you? even for hot doug goodness. 1) call in your order ahead from, say, the corner of addison and damen. 2) drive to dougs, park. 3) excuse yourself past the lined up masses, walk up to the side of the cashier, say, ""i have a pick up"", pay. 4) walk to the back. 5) your bag will be there or ready in less than 5 minutes. 6) chow down in your car. you didn't really want to eat in that crowded place anyway, did you? doug's is the best! along with every combination of regular dogs imaginable, they offer a veggie dog and two kinds of chicken sausages, minimum, for those few of us who don't eat red meat dogs. i love their santa fe chicken sausage, charred to perfection, and their fries, which are always fried up brown and crunchy, not limp and undercooked."
2368,"Yum. Delicious hot dogs, sausages, and french fries. It only gets 4 stars because the bathroom was disgusting."
2369,"The problem with Hot Doug's is its WAYYYYY to close to me so I am always tempted to go. And why not when you have maybe the nicest owner around running the register. That guy is always in a good mood , always polite, and ready to answer any question or tourist hesitation.To add insult to injury the prices are WAYYYY to reasonable. And the other kicker is everything is WAYYYY to delicious. I have not sampled the whole menu but everything I have had was excellent. If its up to me I go with the straight up Chicago dog with everything on it, cant go wrong with that anytime. The fries are perfect, I have never tried the Duck fat ones but I assume they are good. As for the location itself the place is clean colorful and always busy. I may have to go this weekend now that I am thinking about it again."
2370,"I am completely smitten with hot doug's. There was a line out the door and down the block, but it moves fairly quickly. and once you order, the wait is super quick. I had a brilliant smoked apple chicken with sweet curry mustard and melty brie. it was probably the second most decadent thing i've ever had in my mouth."
2371,This is a must if you are in Chicago and want the best hot dogs in the world. I never come here without going to Hot Doug's. Anywhere with a line as long as Hot's cant be bad. The service is excellent and the food is second to none. I can't wait till they open in the morning.
2372,"They have great hot dogs and fries. Oh if only they were closer to my house. It's a great place to go when you are hungover (if you feel like driving)....it's cheap, greasy and good. Oh have I mentioned their fries??? Sooooo good! And the corn dog is pretty yummie. They don't take credit cards....so bring cash."
2373,"Not much to say that already hasn't been said. Hot Doug's is crazy good. I wish the wait wasn't so ridiculous and maybe he could open a takeout window or something. But either way, this place is the spot."
2374,"Hot Doug's has given new meaning to my life. I have found a new mantra and it is, ""There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats,' my friend"". I do love hot dogs, but that has not always been the case. As a child I was an avid fan of the television program, The Simpsons. The character Lisa becomes a vegetarian during one of episode and the final straw for her is when she imagines different meats that she could possibly eat. The final image in her mind are the ingredients of a hot dog. The ingredients included a rat tail, raccoon feet, pigeon head, and boot tongue. After this I completely gave up eating hot dogs. After many years I decided that this was silly and found a new love for hot dogs. I recently have happened upon the restaurant Hot Doug's. Their gourmet hot dogs are something that will blow your mind. The combination of tastes that each specialty hot dog employ have me going back for more. The different games are also something that are exciting. Who knew that boar was delicious topped with Gouda? Uhh I did not until the other day. Would anyone ever assume that foie gras would make an excellent topping for duck sausage? At Hot Dougs all of these dreams have come to fruition. The exciting tastes and delicious foods are something unique to this wonderful restaurant."
2375,"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmm duck fat fries. My boyfriend and I went there on a Friday at prime-time lunch time, while it was raining..you know what that means..I waited outside in the rain, sweet! Well, luckily, the rain must have deterred some people, because we only waited about 30 minutes. While we got 3 hot dogs, 2 of the specials and the game of the day, and I really truly only fully enjoyed ONE of the 3, the experience in itself was worth 5 stars. the duck fat fries were amazing! i am DEFINITELY going back."
2376,"if there is a place in Heaven, Doug has it coming for his wonderful contributions to the science of tubular meats. I mean cm'on Duck fat fries? Duck sausage topped with foie Gras? Amazing. and worth any wait."
2377,Not much to write that already hasn't been written. I will say that I stopped by here on a Monday at 12:30 pm while out running errands. The line was already inside the door and I was in and out (got my order to go) in 15 mins.
2378,"So I rarely go to Hot Doug's anymore because I just don't want to wait over an hour in line for a hot dog and fries. But when I had the afternoon off and figured not that many other people did, I jumped at the chance to bring my boyfriend for his first experience at Hot Doug's. Luckily, we only had to wait around 15-20 minutes. The key is to go on a weekday (non-holiday) and go around 1 pm or later. There will still be a line and it will still be busy, but it won't be a crazy wait. I decided to splurge that day and go with the foie gras duck sausage... I know, I probably shouldn't be as it was banned before, but I had never tried foie gras before and figured I would try it once in my life at least. It was a good but very rich... I thought I would get sick after eating the whole thing, but thank goodness I didn't. It is definitely more of an acquired taste but I did like it. And of course, my favorite at Hot Doug's, is the fries with cheese sauce on the side. My boyfriend had the spicy pork sausage which he seemed to enjoy, and definitely loved the experience there with everything from having Hot Doug take our order old-school on a pad of paper to all the kitchy sausage and old rock decor. If you have never been to Hot Doug's before, you have to try it out at least once. Wait in that long line just for the experience and try the duck fat fries on the weekends just to say you had them. It is a Chicago experience!"
2379,"I went there on a Friday afternoon, and I waited for about an hour and a half! The waiting was terrible and it didn't help that it was a little chilly. I went with my boyfriend and we both got two hot dogs each and duck fries. Try their specialty dogs! Its the best! I wish they had a little more room since everyone always eats there instead of taking it home or picking it up. Do not take a large group, cause itll be hard to find seats. Overall, I have to say this is the best hot dog experience I had in Chicago. THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY! :)"
2380,Love this place!
2381,"-1 star b/c of the long long long line (2.5 hours in the rain) -1 star b/c the duck fat fries taste like regular fries and i was really looking forward to that otherwise, the hot dogs are pretty good but they're $$, not sure if it's exactly worth it. definitely a place to go and try differnet things and have nice cheeses w/ them... but yah, definitely wouldn't wait in that line again"
2382,I love Hot Doug's!!! Their Gator dog with Goat Cheese...I've never tasted such goodness!!!
2383,"Amazing gourmet (and standard) hot dogs. The line can be 2hrs but you forget the wait as soon as you take the first bite. The owner is always there and takes your order. He is incredibly kind. The first time we went, we didn't realize it was cash only . We don't usually carry a ton of cash so were going to skip the Cokes but Doug waived the charge. I was blown away by this gesture (and made sure to bring cash and tip extra the next time). Great place with the best hot dogs I have ever had!!"
2384,"I was lukewarm about this place. We weren't too hungry and decided to wait in line anyway on Tuesday. I got the pear-infused elk sausage with foie gras dijonnaise and gouda cheese, one regular dog for the kid and and my husband got the bratwurst. Nothing seemed extraordinary. The elk sausage was a bit too dry and the sauce didn't balance it out. My son like the Portillo's dog better. and the bratwurst was meh. It can't say it was horrible though, I'm willing to try the place again on my next trip out there."
2385,"I was in Chicago for a short time, and was tired of the regular restaurant fare. I wanted something different, so I thought of my idol Mr. Bourdain and viola! I'm not a hot dog fanatic, but I do know what a good hot dog should taste like. Its a cheap, pleasant, and charming place. I went at 3pm so the line wasn't as long. I loved Costco's hot dog & drink ($1.50) because its cheap, so for double the price and the experience of Doug's casing, it was worth it. Next time I'm in town, I'm gonna try the faux gras dog because it just seems utterly ridiculous, but why not?"
2386,"I have a love/hate relationship with Hot Doug's. I really hate the line that is there ALL the time. But I love the ""It's totally worth it"" feeling when I sit down and eat any of thier outstanding sausages. Well thought out and well executed food. Awesome"
2387,"If you are willing to wait in line, you have to try Hot Doug's. The service is awesome, the staff is so nice. I wish they had longer working hours and take credit cards, however."
2388,Tried to take my little brother before I left Chicago but Closed. Oh well another excuse to go back to visit.
2389,Doug is the man when it comes to meat products in tube form.
2390,"I waited in line in 32 degree weather for 45 minutes for this place. I had to go considering all the hype. I will credit them with creative hot dog creations, but most of it was a bit too wierd for me. I should have stuck with my gut and ordered the chicago dog, but instead i went with something that i cant even remember. It had a ton of flavors going on in it and i cant say that i honestly loved it. I did LOVE their fries though. This place is at least worth checking out."
2391,"I got there before the lunch rush and was amazed at how great the sausage was! I had the Jamiacan carribean jerk with a small fries and drink. The sausage had an amazing sauce with friend bananas on it. It was just too good I had to get 2nds and 3rds to go. I picked up the blue cheese pork sausage with sir william pear cream sauce and smoked almonds and a regular everything sausage and both were too delicious. Before I migrate to Ohio, I will definitely make my way here again!"
2392,Tried this place last week. Line was down the block like everyone's mentioned. I had the alligator dog and the Thai chicken dog with seaweed and siracha & the fries in duck fat.....both dogs were great!!! The fries were just ok- tasted like regular fries. Can't wait to try some other dogs!!!
2393,"Incredible joint, incredible staff... I just wish the place would turf out on the crowd already. Not that Doug and Co. don't deserve the money... the only thing annoying about it are the throngs of idiots that just caught on to this place. Here's a thought... if you're ""just there to get a chicago dog"" then go to say the 1838230320 other places you can get a chicago dog; you're blocking the food and you're baby is way too damn loud as it is...sorry boutcha."
2394,"Absolutely the best hot dog I have ever had. They have it all for the hot dog purist to the foodie who wants it topped with everything. I stood in line for about 45 minutes then got the exotic crocodile dog with the duck fat fries. I wasn't sure at first if I should order the crocodile hot dog because it sounded like a novelty food that might not end up being very good, BUT the hot dog was AMAZING. I've never had such a delicious combination of hot, spicy, sweet, meat goodness in my mouth. In addition, I got to tell my friends that I ate crocodile meat. The fries were good (not sure if the duck fat made a big difference). I loved the outdoor alley seating, as well as the atmosphere inside. I wish there wasn't such a significant wait, but I guess that must be part of the experience! Bring some friends to chat with while in line."
2395,"What can I say? Hot Doug's is fantastic. The specialty dogs are always an amazing blend in your mouth, as owner Doug Sohn knows *exactly* what he's doing. The chief downside is the location, as it's a bit out of the way from the Rogers Park - Near North Side corridor I typically haunt. There's also bound to be a line, but this is one case where the wait is worth your time. Finally, keep in mind that they only take cash, so hit that ATM before heading over."
2396,"After waiting in line for an hour plus, it's a pleasant surprise to be greeted by a friendly bespectacled man who doesn't seem to mind a bit of chit chat, despite the constant stream of people pouring through the doors. This bespectacled man is the genius behind Hot Doug's, and by gosh, he is a master of creating delicious encased meats. I've yet to try a sausage I didn't like, and it only makes it better that you could get a Green River or 50/50 to wash it down!"
2397,"never tried a duck + foie gras hotdog before. its different. if you love foie gras you will love it. im not that sophisticated and actually like cpk's peking duck pizza. so for me, it was just good. different and good. w also had the atomic, a lamb hotdog and chicago style hot dogs. atomic and lamb hotdog's were okay. not really an $8 hotdog. but the actaul encased meat in the chicago style was realllllyyy good. that red colored one. good. really good. duck fried french fries tasted like crispy inNout fries BTW."
2398,"Jesus Christ, what a selection. Unfortunately, I am the type who just likes his plain dog with nothing on it. Still Doug makes a mighty fine dog that pairs well with his homemade fries. I would like to try the ""duck fat"" fries sometime. Do not hesitate to wait in line for one of Chicago's true icons!"
2399,"Coming from LA, I have to say that this is better than Pink's of Hollywood. A buddy from ND suggested this as a must-go place during my visit, and I totally loved it. Their Elvis dog is the best polish dog I've had."
2400,"Hot Dougs incredibly creative tasty satisfying hot dogs!! I love the Salma Hayek (Spicy Andouille Sausage) and The Keira Knightly (Fire Dog), Although I can clearly say if I keep eating these I will never look like their namesake's...I was actually lucky enough to only wait 5 minutes the other day (after 2pm weather was horrid) and Doug was as nice and friendly as can be. I am looking forward to trying the Duck Fat Fries- I hear they are mind blowing. I love the feel of this place it is a true Chicago neighborhood kinda joint. Dig the Viagra clock in between the restrooms it is so classic:) So then I started wondering while I waited for ""The girls"" was the clock a subtle implication for the male clientele?? I dunno the answer to that BUT there are a lotta hotties that come here for lunch....just sayin'."
2401,My coworker tells me that all I eat is baseball foods... well... he's pretty much right! And Hot Dougs is the place to go for hot dogs! The thing i could do without was standing in line for about 50 mins and taking a bus back to the metro since we were too full to walk! Duck fat fries ftw!
2402,"Yes, the wait SUCKS, but there was a guy there selling ice cream! The duck fat fries were nothing special to me, in fact I'm not sure I was too impressed with them. The hot dogs were AWESOME. However, I wouldn't stand in that kind of line for one again. It was fun to try and nice to be able to say I did it. So, that said, I think it's definitely worth your time to try it out!"
2403,"Best food lover ""secret"" in Chicago. As 1300 reviews show, this place is no secret. However I am still amazed at how frequently I can surprise foodies with this barely hidden gem. My wife and I make it our annual Valentine's Day date, showing up at 10:00 am and ordering several game dogs each and duck fries. Then we pass them around, commenting on everything we taste while telling each other how much we love each other ( aw.). The only bad experience I ever had was when my i took my father-in-law and he ordered two regular hot dogs. ""What, I like hotdogs!"" he barked. Seriously, the place is great. And they go beyond for a hot dog joint. There is a ""host"" (again with the quotes?"") who makes sure that no matter how crowded it is, if you have placed an order, you have a place to sit. Be prepared to wait, be adventurous, it's one of the best restaurants in town."
2404,"Strangely enough, if you just want a classic Chicago style hot dog, you could find a better one elsewhere. But if you want to expand your horizons, there is no better place for dog innovation. I had the bacon jalapeno duck sausage with goat cheese gobs and the first bite was the most heavenly bite of food I've had in a long time. It's $7.50 but it is so worth it. Amazing sausage."
2405,Came here with 5 friends 10:40 AM on a rainy Saturday. Even with the weather the line the went around to the very end of the building.... which we didn't really mind since we were chatting the whole time. We all agreed that the wait made us just a little more excited about our food. Part of the wait is so that everyone will be able to sit and enjoy their food. With a group of 6 it somehow magically worked out that a large group left as soon as we placed the order and they even made sure to pull enough chairs together for us. I was pretty amazed by that.... 5 stars for service at a hot dog joint... so on to the food... Rosemary and garlic chicken sausage with cumin mayo and roasted peppers... This was VERY good...Juicy flavorful sausage...the mayo left me wondering where I could buy some... and the peppers added a nice kick. The Elvis... a polish sausage with everything on. Pretty good but didn't think it was the best I've ever had. Everyone else got the foie gras duck sausage... didn't try it myself but everyone was pretty happy with it. Duck fat fries... I give it 3 stars... I had been pretty excited about this... but maybe I don't have the palate that could tell the difference? I had tried the regular fries too and really couldn't tell a huge difference.... a plus that the large portion is huge. We had 4 servings and the 6 of us could barely finish 3 and trust me we were trying... I definitely will return to try their other specials
2406,"Everything on the menu is great. Perfect sized meal for $20-$30. BYOB. Tips: - Check the website before going. You will find the weekly specials. Also, the restaurant may shut down for periods for staff vacations. I'm pretty sure that Doug takes every single order. - Don't be afraid to try something. It is cheap. The Foie Gras Dog is amazing. - On a random weekday, just get there @ 10:20. You will be able to get your food by 10:40. This has worked for me 50+ times so far."
2407,"Waited 45 minutes on a Friday after arriving at 11:15, well worth it. We ordered 2 The Dogs, 1 Corn Dog, 1 Marty Allen, Tater Tots with Cheese, and the Duck Fat Fries The Dog: ands down the best dog I have ever had, and I mean the flavor even without all the delicious toppings. Corn Dog: Also delicious, great flavor in the breading Tater Tots with Cheese: Perfectly crisped on the outside, delicious. Duck Fat Fries: Only part of the meal that disappointed. Not because they were not good, because they were good fries and not too greasy like I expected. But based on the reviews here I was expecting something like I'd never had before, and they weren't. Maybe they are unique for Chicago, but I've had similar fries in Austin."
2408,"This is as advertised! Had heard about it and on a long layover in Chicago I headed over to try it out. Had the special Jack Daniels Sausage Dog, Nice! got there at 2:30 no wait but it would have been worth it. Looks like Doug is printing money here!!! If I lived in Chicago this would be on the weekly rotation."
2409,"This place has basically become a Chicago icon, for good reason. I've probably been here 15 times and there is always something different and amazing on the menu. It doesn't get too much better than this."
2410,To say it's the best hot dog place in town is a little unfair to this place because they do so much more than that. Their hot dogs are good I'm sure but their specialty sausages are just amazing. They're creative and work wonderfully with the toppings they come with. I'm not a fan of the duck fat fries they have on Fridays and Saturdays but their regular fries are really good. You will almost certainly have to wait in line but it's really not terrible if the weather's half decent. If you're from Chicago you have to go once but once you do that you'll want to keep going. The hard thing about that is it's tricky to get to since it's not terribly close to public transit. You could take the Addison or Belmont bus to Sacramento but buses can be a bit unreliable so driving/taxing/biking is the preferred method.
2411,"I'm so glad I live walking distance. It's pretty awesome that you can go during the week and get practically right in. That's the key, otherwise you are waiting for an hour or more. But Doug Sohn is one of my heroes. The habanero jack cheese that he uses on numerous different compilations is outstanding. Not sure what else to say, just make sure you have cash and if you're not adventurous you can just order the Chicago dog with all the fixin's as it is one of the two best in the city (with Superdawg probably winning that title with the pickled green tomato). Outstanding."
2412,good food. inexpensive. super friendly. what more is there to say?
2413,"Oh Hot Doug! I am so sorry that it has taken me so long to return to the encased meat Haven. I do apologize. However, like an old friend, I dropped in and its just like old times. With exception of a few name name changes. I appreciate you keeping up with the pop culture times. It was my chef friends bday and he had never partaken in the culinary wiener expertise that you exude! As usual, I always go for the specials. Gotta getum while they're there. On deck today, duck fat fries, Foie Grais dog, Sausage dog w blue cheese and almonds, and a veal/pork number that was like a super fresh yummy braut. You did me right! My friend was impressed as well. The Blue Cheese number was the best of the day. I would have voted the Foie, but the cool foie against my warm weiner...not a homerun. If the Foie was seared that it would be something from the Encased Meat Gods. Keep up the good work."
2414,"Dude, this place is friggin awesome! Doug is friggin awesome. Last time I went I had the rattlesnake sausage with blueberry sauce and some kind of cheese and it was amaaaaaazing. I always love trying their various game sausages, they never disappoint. My brother got the duck sausage with foie gras which was pretty good, but not great. He also says that they have the best fries he has ever had. They also serve duck fat fried fries every Sunday(?) which are pretty cool. Every time I visit my brother in Evanston I make him take me here no matter how far away it is!"
2415,"doug needs to expand his business hours. these are delicious , delicious treats. so much that my last trip, i was craving this place. took public transportation in 20 some below weather. given that im born & raised with LA lungs, it was one glorious adventure."
2416,"What else is there to say. Line is long, really long (-1 star). The hot dogs are good. Got the Foie gras, Paul Kelly, Chicago dog, duck fat fries and a drink. Total was $19. Glad I tried it but won't be coming back if the line is this long. Check out my pictures!"
2417,"went to HD for first time last month...went early to avoid crowds (10:40 am) and was lucky, only five people in the queue! talked to Doug himself as he takes your order, who is a super guy. after his recommendations, i had the chicago dog, polish dog, and fries. man, it was all good...had to go back to pick up some dogs to go and the ""encased meats"" souvenir t-shirt. driving around California Ave the next day about 1:20 pm, thought we'd get some lunch...and the line to Doug's is snaking halfway down Roscoe!? looking at an hour and a half wait....oh well, we got really lucky the first day."
2418,"I'm going to be the negative reviewer for Hot Doug's. I waited in a 2.5 hour line on my Birthday for what I thought was going to be the best hot dog I've ever had. Not only were they out of what I went there for, but when I asked for cheese, it was cheez whiz, not sprinkled cheeze like I imagined and it totally ruined the dog. Maybe it was a bad day, it was a Holiday weekend, but I was just disappointed and was hoping for so much more. I want that 2.5 hours of my life back, lol."
2419,"Hot Doug's is just something that you have to experience. Definitely go for the specialties like anything with foie gras or rabbit. Skip the plain stuff like the Wisconsin Bratwurst. The duck fat fries are worth the trip alone. Hopefully, there won't be a line out the door when you go... because it doesn't move that quickly."
2420,"I'm a fan! Really cool and laid back environment, and the choices are a bit intimidating. I would highly suggest looking at the menu first via Internet, although sometimes it is not as updated. Me and a buddy went and split four different dogs. We had the Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Sriracha Mustard and Sesame-Seaweed Salad,Three-Chili Wild Boar Sausage with Chipotle Dijonnaise and Smoked Gouda Cheese, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris, and chicken sausage with pepper jack cheese and guacamole. We went just to say that we went, really unique styles of dogs, so we have to come back and check out what the commoners are having. Overall meats were good a bit heavy with the sauces and such."
2421,"Moved to Chicago, felt I owed it to myself to try Hot Doug's, now make it a fairly regular occasion. Yes, it is worth the wait. A 2 hour wait? No. 30 minutes or less? Consider such a small line a gift from the gods, get in line and prepare to be amazed. If you are coming here solely to try a Chicago-style hot dog for the first time, I would recommend going someplace else. Doug does make a mighty fine hot dog with all the trimmings (though you must specify if you want sport peppers), but that is not the real draw of this place. I've always had fantastic experiences with his Chicago dogs, Brats, Thuringers, and all the other sausage staples that he offers, but one truly owes it to one's self to order the Game Of The Week. Take a game animal sausage, such as elk, antelope, or rabbit, add a sauce and cheese that are paired specifically to that sausage, and you have a truly magnificent gastronomic experience. The best I've had is the spicy smoked alligator sausage with Cajun Remouillade sauce and St. Pete's blue cheese. It is easily one of the top five meals of my life. It seems preposterous to many that something as simple as sausage could be this delicious, but this isn't yer brudder Bill's Poolish Sahssidge from da Jool's. Doug takes his craft very seriously, and he loves his job. I'm sure he gets tired of the endless droves of people at the counter every day who still can't make up their minds despite ample decision-making time while waiting in line, but he sure hides it well. His great service, friendly wait staff and all-around great atmosphere (plus the mind-blowingly great food) make this an essential Chicago establishment. If I ever find it in myself to open a restaurant, I'm going to have a talk with him. He has obviously done something right. If you're from out of town and you want to try a Chicago-style hot dog, there are certainly quicker and equally satisfying places to do so. But if you're serious about sausage, Hot Doug's is crucial."
2422,I don't understand the fascination and I would certainly never wait in line that long again. I tried a few different dogs and they were ok. The duck fat fries were very good but not worth waiting outside for 40 minutes for. Glad I tried it though.
2423,"Best hot dog's in Chicago, a definite must even if the line is incredibly long. If you want the full experience go on Friday or Saturday for the duck fat fries (evil genius) and the Foie Gras Dog. I'm not joking, this is THE BEST HOT DOG you will ever eat. And feel free to try the week's special dog, ridiculous in the best way. Refills are free and (contrary to other reviews) Doug is a really nice guy, just crazy. Trust me, you MUST eat here before you die... Ok, too much, but if you're in the city DO GO. It's not a recommendation, it's an order!"
2424,"Great dogs. And all different kinds. The GOOD kind. VERY kid friendly. Long wait, most of the time, but worth every minute. Also VERY friendly and NICE staff. Duck fried french fries Friday----awesome."
2425,"Doug, the foie gras dog, the vegetarian, the BLT everything really .... the whole operation. Go there.... eat and enjoy. just ask the other 1121 people."
2426,Hot Doug was well worth the wait. Doug is so cool when Chicago had ban of foie gras. He snub it and continue his sale. my hero
2427,"Ok so I have mixed emotions on how to approach this review. Having read other reviews and compared them to my own experience I have come to this conclusion. Hot Doug's has not let me down. Yes there's a long line often, and perhaps Doug should open another location to alleviate the congestion but then again who am I to decide what the man should do with his time and money. The man had a great idea and wanted to open a small quaint place that became overwhelmingly popular due to his brilliant idea. I've been there about 6 times now and have gotten 2 different dogs each time and have partook in the duck fat fries as well. The fries are rich but otherwise no big deal however the dogs have always been phenomenal! Definitely worth a stop..at least once."
2428,"The best dog on the planet!! Doug's attention to flavors is what sets apart this establish from any other in Chicago/World. He is a masterful chef creating encased meat symphonies daily. If you like dogs or like food that is well prepared with as minimum of three contrasting flavors ie. ""french food, sushi"", or you have an adventurous/delectable palate, Hot Dougs will completely satisfy every single taste bud you have !!"
2429,"Yummmmmm. Great hot dogs (but hate to use this term with such delicious sausages). I only wish I could have eaten more. Even with a 2.5 hr wait on a Saturday it was more than worth it which says a lot. Get ready to wait on any day, though since it is that good and that famous. Note, I had the duck fat fries which were only meh. Save the money and get another dog or the regular frites."
2430,"Waited in line for an hour. Foie gras dog described by my boy as ""decadent"". I say it's damn good. I'd gladly wait in line for an hour again the next time I'm in town."
2431,"I don't know that I can add to anything else here, but to say that Hot Doug's is spectacular, and what this man is doing is fantastic."
2432,"My wife and I were caught in traffic after we arrived at O'Hare and she noticed we were real close to Hot Doug's. As expected we saw the long line that everyone talks about. It took maybe 35 minutes to get in to order. We got 3 dogs. I got the Kiera Knightly and it was really good. My wife got the alligator and she loved it. We split the Jack Daniels special dog. All were really good. After going to a different hot dog stand off of miracle mile, I now know how terrific these dogs were. Don't leave Chicago without trying this place."
2433,Had to wait in line for 40 minutes outside around the block in the freezing cold..... BUT boy was it worth it! I had a regular Chicago dog and a crayfish /pork sausage special!! What a great experience! You have go there when in Chicago!
2434,"Just got back from a Chicago trip and Hot Dougs was on our short list to try. We decided to stop by for lunch before the Cubs game and it was well worth it. Our group took a taxi from the Sax hotel and found a line of about 20 people outside around 11:15 am. It took us about 30 mins to get to the door and the line had grown to about 50 people. You're standing there making small talk with all the friendly customers around you while taxi after taxi pull up and drop off people. Doug was personally taking orders and very congenial. The food came out fast and the turnover at the tables works so dont worry about not having a place to sit. I personally had The Frankie. Then, we shared an alligator ""Game of the Week"", Paul Kelly, Curry Pork, and Antelope. Everything on it but relish. All great and worth another trip back next time we are in town. The Duck Fat fries (only available on Fridays and Saturdays)were the cherry on top. Crispy and tasty. I would rec coming before 12pm and bring cash since they dont accept credit. This place is a good one."
2435,"come on guys, it rocks. seriously."
2436,I just went there yesterday in the late afternoon at about 3:30 p.m. There was no line and I was able to ask questions about the product till my heart's content. I had the lamb with goat cheese YUM! I just had the regular fries to go with it. Today I'm going for the duck fries and just getting a regular chicago style hot dog.
2437,"One of my favorite hot dog places, and a place I always take out-of-town friends to. It's a religious experience as evidenced by the followers that queue up out the door and along the side of the building every day, rain or shine. I'm into Doug's more exotic creations, the spicier the better. I've been here dozens of times, and will always try to time my visit with the availability of duck fat fries, a truly genius way of making an artery-clogging addiction even more so. Don't be intimidated by the lines or by the crowds inside. The line moves quickly, and I've never had to wait for a table once I've ordered. There's plenty to look at on the walls too while your food is being prepared. This place is truly a Chicago institution and something everyone must experience in their lifetime."
2438,"This place makes you feel like Chicago is the only place in the world where you can get a dog the right way! oh man, the cheese fries! oh man the wait is worth it! i wished they shipped like lou malnati's on dry ice!!!!!!!"
2439,Unreal- flavors I've never tasted before- definitely going back as soon as I get the chance.. There is a reason why the line is so long every day
2440,"It will be quite a wait, but the wait is worth it! I had the Ruben dog and it was very tasty! The owner is very friendly and takes every order."
2441,"My brother and I decided to buckle down and bear the wait for Hot Doug's... no matter what that wait was. I'm definitely glad we decided to do it. It ended up being an hour and a half, but I didn't think that was too bad for a Saturday at noon. The ordering process was extremely friendly and very efficient. I believe Doug himself took our order, and he was super nice. My brother ordered some sort of elk sausage, and I ordered an encased meat (I forget what type of meat now) with spicy pepper jack cheese and a jalapeno mayo. Of course, we ordered the duck fat fries. My brother loved his elk sausage, and I loved my spicy encased meat. We both thought the duck fat fries were good but nothing special. I'd definitely go back to order another unique encased meat, but I don't think I'd bother with the duck fat fries again."
2442,"we went there very early and the line is already building up all the way in to another building. It opens at 10:30am. we got there and i odered the Garlic-Rosemary Smoked Chicken Sausage with rosemary garlic mustard and Smoked Cumin Gouda Cheese- the hotdog itself was too much for me. I could taste of all of the ingredients the garlicky put not too much of the taste of garlic and rosemary..if u like this two ingredient combo then this hotdog is for you. If u want the duck fries...1 order is good enough for 2 ppl , but i didn't know how much portion they give out so my husband ordered one for himself. He ordered 3 hotdogs 1. Ribeye Steak Sausage with chimichurri and crispy fried onions=== i like this kind i guess better on what i have chosen... 2. Foie Gras adn Sauteres Duck Sausage with a truffle aioli foie gras mousse and sel gris---- i am not too fond of the taste of truffle bc it brings an after taste to my mouth my husband love this dog..he said it was tooo rich for him 3. The Dog Chicago Style HOt dog with all the trimmings--- he said he loved all of the 3 dogs.. would i go back ....me personally no not really.. I am not obsessed with hotdog's ...One time is good for me.... Maybe if they have specials that i would be interested. the duck fries--- i couldn't tell the difference. their fries were like shoestring kinds ......"
2443,OMG the best dogs ever. And the french fries made with duck fat are ridiculously good!
2444,"This place was great. Their corn dogs are the best along with thier famous duck fat fries. The only downside is the really long line. Depending on the day, you might have to wait up to an hour...but to some,like my boyfriend and myself, it's well worth the wait. Affordable and fast."
2445,"I am hesistant to give a fast food place 5 stars but Hot Doug's absolutely deserves it. Yes, I know the wait can be unholy but just be a bit smarter and don't show up at rush hour (noon, after a Cubs game, etc). Specialty sausages are incredible and change regularly. Added Benefit: Doug Rocks!!!!!"
2446,I broke vegetarian for this place. Not disappointed in the least.
2447,"Well worth the wait, will say that off the bat because their usually is a wait. If you are a hot dog enthusiast this is a place to visit at least once. I usually get the Dave Kingman (Chicken Sausage) and a regular dog, but there is a pretty good menu including some exotic choices you are not likely to find elsewhere. It's the kind of place I try to take as many people to who haven't tried it before. Not keeping this a secret, since the secrets already out (Travel Channel)."
2448,"I have been a fan of Hot Doug's since before the beginning... My wife used to work with Doug (back in the day, as they say), and we had the good fortune to run into him during his ""between days""...he was working for a caterer, and while he poured us champagne, he told us about this concept he had for a hot dog stand/sausage emporium. We thought the name was catchy, and wished him good luck. but it's not luck that keeps us going back...it's the fabulous combination of great, friendly service, PHENOMENAL sausage combinations (more soon), and that great intangible, ambience, that makes Hot Doug's a must stop at place. I went this past Tuesday, with my two college sons home for the holidays (Doug's is a must stop whenever they're in town), and neighbor BBQ Dave. In addition to a regular dog (charred, raw onions with the works incl. peppers) and Doug's best-in-class fresh French fries, I tried -- now get this -- a BACON SAUSAGE! Man, what a treat!! You like meat? You like bacon?? You like sausage??? You got it, all rolled up into one smoky, pink juicy and cracklin' tube of encased enjoyment!!!! Served on a sausage roll with beautifully carmelized onions, a bit of creme freche, and lovely slices of Camembert cheese....to steal the catchphrase of a local Oak Park chef, ""Oh...My...God!"" Absolutely sublime combination; the snap of the sausage combined PERFECTLY with the soft onions and melting cheese, the creme freche just adding a measure of silkiness (and an additional challenge to those arteries!). Knocked my previous fave (Thai duck sausage with pickled daikon radish) right down to...number 2! But let's talk about ambience. I was horking a handful of french fries (light, fluffy, not a hint of grease or slime, nicely brown and crispy, and BIG!), after being overcome with adulation for my bacon sausage...when the opening strains of Graham Parker's ""Discovering Japan"" blast out of the box. Now, you kids in the audience may be saying ""who?"", but to the cognoscenti of late 70s/early80s rock (of which Doug is a board member), Mr. Parker and the Brinsley-Schwarz band put out some of the toughest, leanest, most cool music post-punk had to offer. And ""Squeezing Out Sparks"" is my absolute fave Parker album! And this, my friends, is ambience...it made a fantastically flavorful food experience even more delightful, knowing that not only is Doug the EFFING SAUSAGE KING-GOD, he's got great taste in music, too. Seals the deal for me...why can't I give Hot Doug's 6 stars?!?!? AND A PS...all you people, complaining about standing in line...why don't you try coming sometime other than lunchtime on Thursday, Friday or Saturday? Just because you're eatin' hot dogs doesn't mean you turn off yer brain..."
2449,"Love this place, its hot doug's, you can't go wrong. I've been going here since before Anthony Bourdain made it popular and the line was out the door. Even with the HUGE increase in customers and the wait, i still find myself going here and waiting in line 30+ minutes. Sigh, i still remember the good old days when i could go on a weekend and there'd be no line. The only thing i'll say is, the duck fat fries, i can tell a difference between the normal fries and the duck fat fries, but its not like ""OMG"" crazy this is the most amazing difference. Actually, for the difference in price i'll pass up the duck fat fries and get a side of cheese or a corn dog."
2450,"I cannot wait until saturdays or when i have a day off work to go to hot dougs, it literally makes my week. Had a go a hot dougs again today, got there a little late (3:15) i thought that they were open until 430, but it was only 4. Got in around 4:30 and doug was still smiling and serving everyone that came in. i had the moutain man and the gyro and beef sausage; both were wonderful. i just can't say enough good things about the food as well as the staff here. a must do for anyone visiting chicago"
2451,"Ok, I went back and went all out. I guess if you're going to a gourmet hot dog joint you should really push the limits. I had some kind of boar sausage and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. When I did Burning Man a few years back someone had some wild boar sausage and it was unfingbelievable. The boar at Doug's was pretty good but not what I remembered. Of course it wasn't 110 degrees, I wasn't surrounded by naked women and starving... The Duck Sausage was another thing entirely. Ok this thing is probably about the richest thing I've ever eaten. Rich upon rich upon rich. This was a few months ago but from what I remember it was absolutely indulgently delicious. The sauce on the dog had little crunchy bits that were awesome. The only problem was the dog, sauce and bun were all pretty much the same texture. And it's all so rich that the taste blends together. But I've never had anything like it and it made the whole Hot Dougs experience memorable. If and when I go back I will have that addictive concoction again."
2452,"If you come here and just order a hot dog, you're a jerk. There are a million places in Chicago where you can get a good hot dog, please stop clogging up the line. Also, the duck fat fries are beyond overrated. They taste like the regular fries, except they're way worse for your health. People in this city like to tell themselves they can tell a difference, but they can't, they're just being fashionable. That being said, Doug Sohn is a true artist when it comes to encased meats The way he works with sausages and pairs it with the perfect topping makes him, not Abe Froman, the true sausage king of Chicago. Also, if you wait over an hour for it you're a jerk."
2453,"Make sure you know the following before you go to Hot Doug's. 1. You will wait in line outside to eat. Be prepared to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. 2. They only accept cash. 3. They have very limited hours. If you accept the above, you will have the best damn encased meats of your life."
2454,"Tried the Teuben - Reuben sandwich in hot dog form (of course) It was delicious. The duck fat fries had been hyped up for me too much. I was expecting a flavor revolution but discovered they were just french fries, although very delicious french fries. Also , I had to wait 45 min to get in on a Saturday, but it was well worth the wait."
2455,Wow and all this time I thought Weiner Circle was the best; wow was I ever so wrong! This place rocks! Best Hot Dogs and Polish I have ever had. Wait could be shorter but worth it!
2456,Want to eat the most exotic hot dogs you can find out there? This is the place! Wait is super annoying but their amazing fries cooked in duck fat and the amazing varieties of different kind of hot dogs you can find is a hard to anywhere else. I had tried their alligator meat and as much as it sounds disgusting it was that much tastier. Try it out folks!
2457,"Hot Doug is correct--There are no 2 finer words in the English language than ""encased meats."" They have a lot of them. All are fantastic. Unbelievable combinations of meat and cheese packed on to high quality buns that range from simple to gourmet, but all are sublime. None of this would matter if they couldn't make a tradtional dog though--but Doug's comes through like diamonds on that. Perfect in every way. If you want it grilled, get it grilled. The duck-fat french fries are the best in the world--hands down, there--I said it. You find me better fries and I'll eat them."
2458,"I want to meet my wife here. If you are going to order a plain hot dog......DON'T come here. You won't get it. Same goes for a typical Chicago dog. That's not what this is about. The specials. Go for the specials. Order 3. Go crazy. Take a nap afterwards. An afternoon at Hot Doug's is about all the happiness I need. But I do have to admit....all the publicity this place gets has given it a bit of a novelty feel, and I think it gets busier and busier because it's the ""thing to do"". So, if you are going to be a member of the block long ""line party"", do me a favor......don't order a plain hot dog. Take a leap. Try something different....and you'll forever be a member of something special. Again. Order 7 different hot dogs. Then nap. Trust me. Heck, order 10. I won't tell anyone. I promise."
2459,Its fine just not for me. Nothing bad just nothing I really liked. Quality food just not my taste. I think everyone should go once.
2460,"Worth the wait. Split the fries with friends, skip the duck fat fries IMHO. Order one of everything!"
2461,Well worth the wait. FYI: cash only!!! Chris S.
2462,"if i could give 6 stars i would. we waited 90 minutes and it was worth it. we got the sonoran dog, the elk and pear dog, and duck fat fries. i pretty much died and went to heaven. the staff is really friendly and the service is great once you order and sit down."
2463,"Genius. Absolute genius. Doug's encased meats are ethereal. Sad the mountain man was not available...antelope just fine today... If you're worried about the line, it may be shorter on a cold day. I always go when I have time, line or not. Once the thought of a gourmet sausage enters my mind, there's no turning back. Doug is the best. I once saw him tell a guy ""cash only,"" and instead of making him go get cash, he wrote up an IOU on notebook paper! An IOU? Seriously?! If only all people were that nice!"
2464,"Hot Doug's is very good. They offer a lot of unique sausage options like Foie Gras, alligator, crayfish. The service is also very good! The guy who took our order is very friendly and energetic. The food came our really quickly and everything was very tasty. I even loved their fries. I order the regular Chicago style hot dog and a truffle infuse chicken sausage. Both were awesome. I also got a large side of fries which were also very good. I really wanted to try their duck fat fries, but unfortunately they are only served Friday and Saturday. The line can get very long. I think we waited for about 1hr. It's a great experience with good food and interesting options. However, I don't think I'd do too often. The wait is just too long for hot dogs. And while the regular dogs and sausages a decently priced the specialties are quite pricey in comparison. The regular dog was $1.75 while the truffle infused one was $7.25. It's definitely worth a try though."
2465,"I heard great reviews of this place from friends and figured I must give it a try. After my first bite, I couldn't wait for another... and another and another. Waiting in line is not a big deal because all you do is lose yourself in dreams of your next amazing hot dog. IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE YET, GET UP AND GO!"
2466,Best dog in the city!
2467,"There is nothing funny, insightful, or otherwise that I can say about Hot Doug's without repeating what has already been said 100 times before. If you have never been there, go. If you have been there and have found a way to think about anything other than going back, please let me know how you did it."
2468,BLT dog is my absolute favorite when i'm hungover. DELICIOUS.
2469,"This place doesn't really need a lot of people online saying how great it is. It's incredibly popular and where else are you going to find sausages from rare animals. The more exotic sausages tend to be extremely flavorful and surprisingly filling. I can't say I like everything I've had there, but it's more about trying out something new and discovering what's good. Also the regular old hot dogs are not too bad and well priced. Just expect a long line."
2470,"Every time that I drive past Hot Doug's there is a line wrapped around the building, but for some reason the encased meat gods were smiling on me this day cause there was no line. Now I wasn't even hungry, but I knew that this was my opportunity. I ended up getting the Cajun pork sausage with cheese filled peppers and spicy mayo, and I AM HOOKED. On top of that the staff couldn't have been nicer. Next time I go I'll have no problem waiting in line. Good job guys."
2471,"This place is really good, I wish I lived closer. Definitely try one of their specialty sausages and the duck fries. Amazing."
2472,"i heart hot dougs. thank goodness i don't live any closer to this place cause those tasty sausages would lure me in like a sirens' song and i would probably weigh a bajillion pounds. i'll pretty much echo what everyone else has said. check the menu online before you go so you know what you're getting in to. expect to wait about an hour, mostly outside (don't worry, sooooo worth it). try the duck fat fries if you get a chance and definitely get a couple different dogs. most of them are reeeediculously good, a few of them are kind of weird but still tasty and some of them add character. don't be afraid to try the game of the week. kangaroo, antelope, elk, etc. all taste pretty damn good in sausage form."
2473,"There is no other place in Chicago where you can get true gourmet food with fries and a soda for under $10. Seriously, if I go for over a month without a lunch at Doug's I begin to get sad. Truly one of the best things about Chicago. Doug may be the smartest/coolest man working in food in Chicago."
2474,Most delicious $7.50 Hot Dog I have ever had. Is this place ever not crowded? I will be back.
2475,"Really good hot dogs. I don't get very adventurous and just order the regular dog. My husband always gets a specialty dog and usually enjoys it. This is the place I bring people from out of town to so that they may experience a ""Chicago style"" hot dog. The guys taking orders is great. I do wish they accepted credit cards."
2476,"I really like this place...the only thing that sucks is that it's not closer to my house. Doug's usually there taking orders which I totally respect as well. I go by for some eats every three months and every time I am satisfied. Everything sounds so good and I'm always surprised by the different gourmet hot dogs I'll see there. I mean, as with all places, you get some hot dogs that are hit or miss and it's happened where I've gotten a couple misses. But, I usually get more hits - that might also be due to the fact that I usually drop $80 on hot dogs when I'm there."
2477,"What a awesome place. It was worth the 30 plus minutes in the freezing weather outside. We came directly from O'hare on a Friday afternoon. We were so glad we made it before the 4PM closing time. Since it was Friday, we were able to ordered the Duck Fat Fries, unbelievable delicious. The sausages were excellent, and the price was great. The two drawbacks to this place is the wait and the smokiness of the dining room (from the fryers and grill). But the food, price and friendliness of Doug deserves a 5. Don't miss the Duck Fat Fries!!!!!"
2478,"Let me be review number six-hundred-whatever... Economically, it makes no sense waiting two hours for a hot dog. You could go to Target, Jewel, Catch a movie, eat a hot dog at another place, and maybe write the great American novel in the same time span. Yet this is Hot Dougs and waiting is part of the experience, but not for me. Economically, you should only go there for the specialty dogs. You can get a Chicago dog just as good waiting at some other place just five minutes. And when you go, go early. On a Tuesday at 11a.m. Take a day off and make it a mystical journey that only happens every few months. No duck fat fries can shed a couple minutes off the line. When you do sit down with your elk dog or alligator sausage it's great. But be nice: eat, then leave. There's people behind you."
2479,"Duck fat fries: so good. Fois gras with truffle mustard dog: very good. Waiting in line for only 10 minutes: the best! The other sausages on the menu look really interesting, but this is a place you go to when you have a lot of time to kill to wait in line. By the way, Doug is impressive as a human calculator and super friendly."
2480,My burps were still delicious three hours later. Totally worth every second of a two hour wait in line.
2481,I guess you could say I was kinda disappointed in hot dougs. I always check out yelp before going anywhere and hot dougs had tons of great reviews. The hot dogs were good but not waiting in line for two hours good. If you have never been and don't mind killing a couple hours you should check it out. They do have tons of gourmet hot dogs that are yummy. I don't think ill be going back anytime soon (unfortunately)
2482,"Amazing specials, worth-the-wait traditional Chicago dogs, and foamy soap in the women's bathroom--what more could you want? How about the always friendly and gracious Doug to take your order? Each time I approach the counter, I feel as if I have been granted an audience with the Pope of Sausages himself (though Doug would never take himself so seriously, and he doesn't wear a ring to kiss :) As another reviewer noted, many enter but few leave, yet there's always a seat when you need one. I won't hazard a guess why this is so, I'll just stick to my favorite Hot Doug's formula: arrive as close to opening time as possible (on a weekday) and wait a reasonable half hour or so until served. From arrival to sated in less than an hour."
2483,"Yeah, this is the best hot dog...er, ""encased meat"" place in the city. You can read the other 700+ reviews to get a sense of that. You can see the line that goes down the block from open to close to see that everyone and their brother knows this, too. Five stars, nuff said. But I do think this place suffers a bit from ""Blair Witch"" syndrome. You know, a great horror flick, but it had SO much hype preceding, it was really hard to live up to it in the end, no matter how good it really was. Coming here (and waiting..and waiting) for the first time, you're expecting some kind of religious experience and may actually be disappointed. Even though it's great and still the best place of its kind in the city. I don't know who Doug's PR guy is, but as if the lines weren't long enough, Anthony Bourdain recently put this on his short list of ""places to eat before you die"", up there with Le Bernadin and French Laundry! This kind of great PR means the lines around Doug's have slowly gotten longer and longer. Doug *really* needs to expand. I mean it's great he takes everyone's order personally and the banter he has with the customers is part of the experience, but at some point the +hour long wait starts to become a major deterrent to coming here as a regular. Is it even practical to be a regular here? The duck fat fries are awesome, but over-hyped. They're great, but not so much greater than regular old fries. The foie gras duck sausage was just OK (though I loved how Doug fought the city's inane ban on foie gras and continued to serve it). The Thuringer and Italian sausage are just awesome. One day I'll have to actually order a regular hot dog, but it's hard to wait for an hour and just get a regular dog. And that's the problem now. You could never just ""pop in"" at this place, but with all the extra hype of the last couple years you actually have to plan a whole afternoon just to come to grab a bite."
2484,"I waited almost 2 hours for my hot dog, and it was totally worth it. the rib-eye hot dog was delicious, and the duck fat fries were decadent. Surprisingly, although the wait for the hot dog is outrageous, once you get inside, there are plenty of seats. I suppose that makes sense since it doesn't take very long to scarf a hot dog. I would HIGHLY recommend Hot Doug's if you're a hot dog fanatic and are open minded to incredibly creative variations. If not, then there are better ways for you to spend 2 hours. oh, and i HATE when people whine about waiting more than an hr for a hot dog. You know this going in. if you're not willing to wait in line and make friends with your fellow hot dog fanatics, go home."
2485,"As a frequent traveler, i'm often suckered into overrated establishments in whichever city I may be calling home for the week. I was looking for a good Chicago dog and someone at the airport suggested Hot Doug's. So I did a quick search on Google Maps and head over to California Ave at 10:30am on a Monday. My first impression when driving past Hot Doug's? - ""This place must be good."" At 10:30 am (opening time), on a Monday mind you, there was a line already out the door. I had no idea what to expect at hot doug's so while waiting in line i opened up yelp and the rest is history. I was expecting your run-of-the-mill good hot dog; just your standard beef/pork frank with the fixins. I couldn't have been more wrong. Doug was working the counter and took my and every single persons order in the most polite, friendly manner I honestly have ever seen apart from 5-Star restaurants (but even then you know its not sincere). I had the game of the week and the celebrity of the week. Unbelievable flavors you would never expect out of a hot dog(encased meats to be correct). Honestly, all I have to say is: BELIEVE THE HYPE. Go out of your way for Hot Doug's. PS- I later found out Anthony Bourdain listed HD as 1 of the places to eat before you die. I could not agree with him more."
2486,"This place is no joke! I had been greatly anticipating my trip here after watching it on 3 TV shows and reading all the mouth-watering reviews on Yelp. Thank god my brother lives no more than 2 miles away and lent me his car for the day. We made the short drive over on Friday morning and arrived at about 10:10. By this time there was a decent 20-person line outside with half of them being locals and the other half being tourists (the ones taking pictures of the line and signs....like me). The place opened promptly at 10:30 and we were at the counter ordering by 10:50. The two of us shared four dogs: Scott Christman - Swiss Cheese Smoked Knackwurst w/ smoked paprika mayonnaise & smoked provolone cheese, Ribeye Steak Sausage w/ Horseradish Cream Sauce, a Keira Knightley, and a regular Chicago Dog. And of course we got an order of duck fat fries. My favorite was definitely the Scott Christman, which had a really nice smokey flavor and loads of cheesey goodness. While I can't attest to how the duck fat fries compare to the regular fries, they were unbelievably good and lived up to the hype. Oh yeah and Doug? One of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. You can see any sense of impatience disappear from the people in line as soon as they get to the counter talk to Doug. Plus he paces the line nicely so that there's always an open table. Really the only thing that could make this place better is if they cloned Doug and they opened up locations throughout the country."
2487,"The best thing is Doug himself, bedecked in his black tee shirt, and big black nerd glasses. He looks like he wondered in from the set of the old movie ""High Fidelity"". Doug has a laugh and a good word for each customer, while he personally mans the cash register in the tradition of small joints for eons. Careful, though. Doug takes time off now and then and the place is simply closed while he has ""gone fishin'"". So call to make sure he is open. The lunch line is insane. So go for early or late lunch. Many chefs meet there for mid-afternoon encased meats before going off to look after heirloom tomatoes and froth. This is not a classic Chicago hot dog stand. This is a tribute to encased meats of all sorts. Goi with the oddities and enjoy."
2488,"What a classy, classy hole in the wall. Ha! There's no other way to describe this little gem. We bought something like 5 dogs and a humongous bag of crispy fries with cheese for around $12. The steamed dogs were delicious and the fries... mmm. I really kind of wish they had ""specials"" more like your typical hot dog joint but otherwise it's an amazing experience. They serve the sort of hot dog that Chicago should be famous for."
2489,"Wow! This place really makes some damn good hot dogs. We were heading back home to SF and made the trip on our way back to the airport and prayed that there wasn't going to be a long line. Well we were in luck. It is Tuesday around 2:30 in the afternoon. Still a line, but not wrapping around the block as we feared. We tried a whole bunch of different hot dogs and they were all very good. Being very critical of our hot dogs we had discussion about whether this actually beats out Top Dog from the San Francisco area. I will have to admit that Hot Dougs comes up on top here. Everything we had was oh so yummy. We pretty much tried out half the menu or more. One of the ladies ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage. This thing is super good, but really heavy. She had to get something different since it was rich and she couldn't handle since we ate right before this too. This means I got more than one bite....yummy, yummy, yummy!!!"
2490,"Seriously, don't try any other hot dog. This is hands down the best place in the USA to get a hot dog. And Doug is awesome!"
2491,"Okay. So you waited in line for two hours. For a HOT DOG. But you forget all that once you reach the front of the line and are greeted with Mr. Hot Doug's smiling face. And he should be smiling. Not only does he make one mean dog, but he's got hundreds of people who will spend the equivalent of three lunch breaks just to get one. And it's worth it. Smoked gouda, foie gras, and truffles-oh my...ingredients like these make you pine for a hot dog like you never thought possible. And the best part (aside from the duck fat fries)? Leaving with a satisfied smile as you hear someone say, ""is this really the line?"""
2492,"On one of my many trips to chicago, I finally visited this place after seeing it on ""No Reservations"". The Foie Gras with Duck Sausage, I imagine this is what Crack is like. Since I've come back to NY, it is all I think about. I regret trying that first, because it lessened my taste for my other purchases that day. Not that they weren't good, but they couldn't compare. Duck fat fries are good, but the regular fries are also quite tasty. Dying to return to Chicago. There was an opening 10:30 rush, and by 11:30 the line was around the corner. I arrived at 11 and waited only about 10 mins, and you can tell the 10:30 rush because all the tables emptied at about the same time. The owner is also very friendly when taking your order, great experience. He suggested I get a small soda since I was dining in and its free refills, great guy."
2493,"If you have yet to visit Hot Doug's do so. It'll be a refreshing experience. Their hot dogs are like nothing I've ever had before. First visit here the line was slightly out the door, it went by fast. I was pleased to see the owner, Doug, working the counter. I ordered the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel and duck fries: D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!! (for a hot dog) I had a bit of my friend's hot dog (sorry I forgot the name), it also was really good. After my friend and I quickly devoured our food. We glanced at the line and then looked at each other. We went for round two. We each got a different hot dog from the Specials. Everything we ordered was finger-licking good! I will definitely be going back! NOTE: Duck fries are only served Friday & Saturday. Only open until 4pm & Closed Sundays."
2494,"Hands down, without a doubt, the absolute best hot dogs in the world! These are gourmet dogs made with every type of tasty protein imaginable (duck, gator, chicken, pork, lamb, beef, snake) and paired with the most perfect cheese/toppings you could ask for. I wish I lived in Chicago just so I could eat there weekly! Doug, you are doing a terrific job and I appreciate the hard work and time you continue to put in along with all your employees! There's no line that is too long to wait in for your wonderful establishment."
2495,"Yes! This was probably the Best Hot Dog I have ever had. And, I would go back if I am ever in Chicago again. Here are a couple tips: 1. Make sure you go hungry because you will want to order everything on the menu. 2. Try to find out the time when there are the least amount of people in line. Yep, that's right there was a HUGE line outside, and it was below freezing outside when we went. We waited almost an hour. (reason for only 4 stars and not 5) I just had to prepare you. Still, like I wrote, ""Best Hot Dog"", ever. Oh, and the cheese fries were pretty darn good too."
2496,"AMAZING! I love meat, encased meat is especially delicious. I can't wait to go back."
2497,"I've lived in Chicago, New York, San Diego, and now Indiana. This is BY FAR the BEST hot dog stand EVER! Superdawg doesn't even come close!!!!! This place is more Chicago than the Bears!!!!!!!!!"
2498,"Hot Doug's is a Chicago legend. This restaurant has been featured on several television show, most notably the Food Network. Chances are you will find yourself in a long line. In the Chicago cold this can be quite unbearable. Rest assured, the wait is well worth the pain! The menu is vast and very entertaining. The food is also great! Doug was working the register when I went in and he helped answer some questions. The duck fat fries are very good and the veggie dog was excellent. Defiantly give this kitschy hot dog joint a try!"
2499,"Yah! I'm a fan....my boyfriend bought some hot dogs to go for me. I loved the pork with cheese dog, it was super rich and super good. He also got me the thai which was a little disappointing and I love anything thai, but i think the seaweed topping threw the flavor off a bit. 4 stars because i haven't actually been there (locationally challenged) and loved one of the two dogs I had."
2500,"What can I say? The food is amazing, the place runs like a well-oiled machine, and Doug is a fun, friendly guy. LOVE. The hours can be limited, and the line is usually around the block, but it's well worth the wait. GO. NOW. EAT."
2501,"HIGHLIGHT OF THE NITE: FIRST EVER 5 STAR RATING. mm mm how a sausage should taste like and then some. being so far far far in LA how i miss the delicious gourment sausages that NO WHERE have i found that compares. first off. the sausage. ain't no plain jane all beef vienna sausages that be there specialty (yet they do have them and are good) but it's all about the specialty sausages. i always tend to get one of their game of the week. we tried the duck sasuage, buffalo and some jamican jerk sausage. now some places use these as gimicky tricks and then you take a bite and are like oh laa laa but than realize it don't taste any different. but hot doug's does it right pairing the meat with cheeses and sauces that make each sausage very distinctive. also a must is the fries (have tried the duck fat fries before but quite honestly you can't really tell the difference) with cheese and ghardinera and it is awesome. decore is kinda divey hot dog joint and very casual. be warned the line gets quick long during peak lunch hour times but trust me it's worth it!! LA hotdogs just don't compare..my tummy is growling jus thinking about these delicious bites."
2502,"I love Hot Doug's. I have been eating there pretty much since the day he opened his current location on California. My company, RIchardson Seating, manufactured his retro style chrome diner chairs. I actually prefer his regular fries, so I usually end up going on weekdays right when he opens. I would rather eat at an off time than wait in line. The sausages are fantastic. These are not your usual sausages. They have elk, boar, alligator, rib eye, and other non traditional sausages. There are specials all of the time so the menu is usually different each time you go back. They also carry your standard hot dogs and polish sausages. I usually split three sausages and a fry with one other person. The meal comes out to about $25.00 for both of us and that leaves us very stuffed. Most people prefer the duck fat fries so if you want to give them a try, make sure to go on a weekend."
2503,Way over hyped but still pretty good. I feel like they move the line slow just to make it seem like everybody is there. They could move the line a lot faster. This is a must stop that everyone should experience. I will go again!
2504,Pros: It's Hot Doug's. I think that says it all. If there is one place I take friends who are visiting Chicago it's here. Doug is a great guy and alwasys has awesome suggestions. The Chicago Dog is easily the best in the city and the specialty dogs are masterworks. On my last trip I had the Black and Blue dog and am not sure I will ever enjoy another hot Dog as much. Cons: The lines and it's CASH only... Still it's 5 stars easy.
2505,"This place is incredible. Definitely worth the wait. And Doug is as cool as it gets. For people who have never been here, Doug is the owner and the guy who takes your order at the cash register. He's very friendly and makes you feel like you're the only person in the restaurant when it's your turn to order. From the regular menu, I recommend the Frankie ""Five Angels"" Pantangelli and The Elvis. But you should really try something off the specials menu, especially the Ribeye Steak and the BLT."
2506,"2 Words - Ahhh mazing Although the wait is ridiculous (around an hour at lunchtime on a Friday), it is well worth it. I tried 3 dogs today: The Sonoran - Jalapeno bacon with a jalapeno sausage Foie Gras - Duck Liver Marty Allen - Beef, Sausage and Garlic Although it cost me a little over 20 bucks (after adding the duck-fat fries), I do not regret spending any of it. The dogs are juicy, toppings fresh and you get to have a nice chat with Doug before getting your food. The duck-fat fries are not bad, but nothing extremely special. Also, the foie gras was great, but not worth 9 dollars. Personal Recommendation: The Sonoran as is and Marty Allen with everything. Side of duck-fat fries don't hurt."
2507,"I had the game of the week, bison and also had the alligator both amazing. Definatly worth the 40 min wait. Also the duck fat fries were amazing.!"
2508,The duck fat fries are EXCELLENT! This place also makes it easier for the timid eaters out there to try wild game meats in a familiar form. Absolutely delicious!!!
2509,You shouldn't really come here for just a Hot Dog. Got to try the wide variety of meats available. Love the fries. I am one of those people that have waited an hour in the snow and yes...I'd do it again. FYI: Bring Cash
2510,Worth the wait. Long line though!
2511,Everybody knows how amazing Doug's is. I just wanted to do my part to get it into the five star realm.
2512,"If I weren't so impatient I'd roll 5 stars. It's not their fault they can't service all us as quickly as we'd like. Their food rocks, people know it, so people show up.The wide options are great and duck fat fries are to die for.I'd go more often if it weren't for the wait time and the fact that all of the fat in the food makes my stomach crazy."
2513,"I'm absolutely stunned on the high ratings Alinea is getting.I'll keep it short. If you like pretentious dinning at an obscene price, this is the place for you.If not, there's way better food at a much better price in Chicago."
2514,go some place else to eat you tourists....
2515,"I can't believe the reviews that this restaurant is getting! I am a foodie and open to interesting food experiences - but this place is a science experiment gone bad. I would say that only 2 of the 24 tasting bites made me say wow. That's not the percentage you are expecting when you pay $1000 for 2 people for dinner.Too many freeze dried, liquid nigrogen items - this treatment was used on a least 5 of the dishes. There is very little in the way of actual food. Don't get me wrong, I love tasting menus, small portions and fine dining. I expected just little bites - so it is not at all about the quantity of food - it is about the taste and flavours. So underwhelming. This restaurant it all flash and illusion with very little substance. If you have money to burn and want to go for the ridiculous experience than at least do yourself a favour and skip the wine paring. Wines are ordinary - and it the end since there is little food you just end up feeling drunk and getting a hangover.I have been to many high end restaurants around the world and was excited to go to Alinea. It is safe to say it was the worst food experience that I have had."
2516,Best gourmet hot dog/sausage dog place in the entire world. I'm from California and have probably eaten here more than most Chicagoans. I am 5ft tall and weigh 100 pounds...and when I come here I will be sure to order at least three dogs off the special menu. The Foie Gras is my favorite and a must try!! BTW - Ate at Hot Doug's rival Frank N Dawgs and that place was absolutely disgusting. Hot Doug's all the way baby!!!!
2517,One word.Wow.
2518,"Wow. Truly the dinning experience of a lifetime. I have a lot to say about the meal I had at Grant Achetz's Alinea. I haven't stopped talking about it for the last three days. However, so much of the fun comes from the surprise that awaits you with every course I wouldn't want to spoil anything with too many details. I'll just say; the food is art, it's theater, it's emotional, it made me laugh out loud several times, it was epic, and worth every penny. Cheers to Chef Achetz!"
2519,"Make Alinea a destination in your life, you won't be disappointed. Food, service, setting and ambiance are all stellar. A food-lover's paradise on Earth. Nuff said."
2520,amazing food experience. try it at least once in your life. I am from chicago and I am proud to have this restaurant in my city.
2521,incredible experience
2522,"We had a great experience at Alinea. We have been meaning to go here for months now and finally were able to go on a free night. The food was absolutley to die for! Great service, we would recomend it to everybody."
2523,"I don't get the hype, However i am Russian by birth and perhaps its all too greasy and American for my taste buds. I also don't understand why people line up in the cold, to pay $10.00 for the hotdogs...Three stars for the cute friendly Doug."
2524,"The food is unbelievable. Everyone said it all already, but I will say one thing different than others...I've been here 4 times, and each time I saw people taking pictures of their food -- it was really weird when someone asked if they could take a picture of MY food. Get ready for a really different experience here. I don't remember art being on the walls (but maybe there is?) -- what I remember is thinking WOW - the art is on my plate!My perception of the place was different based upon who I brought -- 4 different people. Go with someone who appreciates fine dining and someone who doesn't mind eating unusual food."
2525,1500 reviews and a 4 1/2 average? All Star Hall Of Fame status!This place is worth the hype and well worth the wait in line!Everything I have ever eaten here is AMAZING I am glad I stopped by while visiting Chicago. The owner was very friendly and glad to (briefly) talk baseball even though there was a line around the block (for serious!)
2526,The quality is worth the line. Dont go here unless you can afford the time. Especially recommended if you are out of town and want to eat some good stuff.
2527,Ok... So I finally broke down and tried it out. After all of the hype I thought that I would be disappointed. Ummmmm no. There's a reason why there is a line around the corner all the time. Doug has taken the hit dog to an artistic level and made some combos that you wouldn't even imagine. Even if you aren't a hot dog fan you owe it to yourself to give it a try. Maybe just wait till it warms up (for good!) since all good things come to those who wait.
2528,"The hot dogs are good but I had such high expectations for this place that it was a big disappointment. My hot dog was not hot, and I had to ask twice for a new one. It was extremely busy and we waiting outside for half an hour. However, I think it was an off day and I'm going to give it another try."
2529,"I had rattle snake here! And it didn't kill me! If you haven't already been, just go check it out already, you won't be disappointed (even in February weather)."
2530,"Best hot dogs ever. No real comparison at this point and I'm not really a hot dog person. The menu changes consistently and is posted on the wall (by the time you get to the menu everything looks good), the options keep you interested even if you've been to Hot Doug's before. The duck fat fries weren't bad, but for me, they underwhelmed. That being said, the hot dogs more than made up for the fries. As most everyone else has already pointed out, Doug works the counter and is friendly as can be. Doug's got a great sense of humor, quirky, down-to earth and will offer suggestions based on whatever info you give him (though you really can't go wrong). Best hot dogs, ever.The only downside is the wait and that it's crowded. We waited for around an hour and a half, which for some is ridiculous for any food, let alone hot dogs. For us, we'll be back, probably with a good book to read in line and we'll probably order more than one dog per person next time."
2531,All the reviews are true. I need not repeat them. Best restaurant in Chicago.
2532,"Awesome menu... lots of variety. Very long wait, but worth it.Variety is the spice of life. I love this place!"
2533,"of course the food and and service is great, but the staff needs to maybe take it down a notch.... a bit over the top to the point of annoying, very pretentious. the atmosphere is very very dry and everyone whispers as if im at a funeral? I get the whole experience and chicago scene and whatnot, but guys, it's ok, friendly conversation with the patrons is ok. i hate to say it but when i left i laughed a little.. haha"
2534,"Awesome, love the dogs, love the the decor, love Doug! Lots to be said about an owner that is always there and pleasant to boot!"
2535,"great food, great service. interesting dishes, and well plated."
2536,"Not sure what more can be said about this place!! It was a long wait, but damn well worth it. Potato dog with havarti cheese is my go to..I've tried some of the sausages too and they are fantastic. you really cannot GO WRONG!!"
2537,"Alinea is truly an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime experience.Service is outstanding. Decor is simple yet intimate. Not a big restaurant which I think is important to not overcrowd so you can enjoy the experience. Went with my boyfriend a month ago. We got the 24-course tasting menu with wine pairing for both of us, which I do NOT recommend. 2 wine pairings are a bit too much because we both got pretty drunk towards the end.. haha. Also not recommended to help your boyfriend finish some of his drinks. So for couples, I recommend just getting 1 wine pairing for 2 people.Hopefully I'll be able to go again soon!"
2538,"After reading several of the past reviews, I feel like I agree with all the reviews. My wife and I put our reservation in over 6 months before we got a table, but it was worth the wait. I will never go back, because I don't think any meal can justify the $150 per person price tag (just the cost of the tasting menu), but if you really want to splurge, it is worth a try for the experience."
2539,"On a recent visit to Chicago, I was excited to have gotten a reservation at Alinea. I had heard a great deal about the chef and his food, and since I've yet to get a coveted reservation at Per se in NY (my hometown) I was eager to try Chicago's much-celebrated restuarant. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met, and the whole evening was a bit too contrived for me. From the sliding door upon arrival to the hushed tones of the wait-staff that take themselves way too seriously, the evening was a disappointment. The food was good, but not outstanding. You don't get a menu so you don't know what's coming out, and there's no full bar, so you really have to go with the wine pairings (which were very good). It's just as well, since it would be impossible to select a proper wine to accompany the many courses. Maybe it's me, but I just don't go for having to be instructed on how to eat my food, which it was happens with just about every course. I have spent $600 for dinner for 2 before at top restaurants and have done so gladly, since I really do appreciate a fine dining experience; it's just that Alinea wasn't one of them. Everything was okay, but just not stellar. And for the prices charged, the bar should be set at stellar or above. I can still tell you every course I had at a meal at Lespinasse 5 years ago, and yet I'd be hard-pressed to recall more than 2 or 3 of the courses I had at Alinea just 1 week ago. Overall I'd say that Alinea is a good restaurant, but I'm at a bit of a loss to get what all the fuss is about. My meals that same week at MK and Copperblue in Chicago were better and much less expensive, and I'd recommend those restaurants over Alinea if you're visiting (or live in) Chicago."
2540,"I'll take this place over Charlie Trotters any day. While I don't like to eat this way, it's as comfortable and approachable place as you get for this type of crazy dining!"
2541,"Oh man...get ready for this people. I've done the Tasting menu (12 courses) once and the Tour menu (yesterday was 29 courses! Took 5 hrs!!!) twice. It's SOOO expensive but worth every penny. The quality of food is out of this world and the way everything is presented to you is nothing short of innovative and simply amazing. The chef can be classified more as a chemist than anything. The way flavors are mixed and presented you is a journey all on it's own. The best meal you will ever have, gauranteed."
2542,"Ever so delicious. Just as incredible as they say. Best service I've had, made me and my wife feel like king and queen. Like royalty. Well worth the bill."
2543,Worth the wait..great dogs
2544,"My buddy has been going here almost everyday for his lunch break and I have been making fun of him. I kid you not, he seriously has put on about ten lbs since July and I keep telling him it's because that is when he started going to Hot Doug's. Finally I decided to I needed to put on some weight and instead of my usual lunch joints I joined him. I think I am going to be 20lbs more by summer, this place is amazing but I don't have to tell you that because they have a crazy number of reviews. Plus they finally motivated me to yelp!"
2545,"First off, you'll wait in line Bubba. take that fact to the bank. it'll be worth it, trust me. second, for all you Canadians/folks from origional 6 hockey towns, Doug, the friendly proprietor displays an encylopedic knowledge of old school NHL hockey. now to the main act...The Hot Dogs are to die for - as in last meal on earth calibre. Last time i was there in November, we rolled in and doused our hangovers with the foie gras, the mountain man, the luca brassi and the traditional chicago style. the duck fat fries are a particular delight but you can only get them on Friday and Saturday. Wash it all down with a cherry cola. go now."
2546,awesome food. hits the spot whenever i have a craving.
2547,"I really Like Hot Dougs. I think he is an innovator and pioneer in this area. After going there many times, I believe each time is a little less great as the previous time. I guess this is statistically consistent given the standard deviation of your first and ultimate experience; it would be nearly impossible to replicate that feeling every future visit.The only thing that has changed for me as far as Hot Doug's goes is that amount of time I am willing to wait in line.After going over 5 times, I wouldn't wait more than 15-20 minutes to get in, and for those who know, this is almost an impossibility."
2548,"So i was very intrigued with the interest in the restaurant, always a line around the block on weekends. Till i went and waited all day to get a hot dog? Wasnt that amazing, was just a hot dog...there are other restaurants like this in chicago-without the long line-tastes the same...While it was good, and service was great...i dont understand the hype...i was expecting something greater."
2549,"Never did I think that foie gras belonged on a hot dog, but here I stand corrected....and full. It's too bad I don't live in Chicago or I'd go back until I had tried everything on the menu.Hot doug's is awesome. It's one of the single greatest places I've ever eating. It pulls no stops in making your food delicious yet cheap. There's always a long line, which tells you something, but getting your food doesn't take long once you're in there. Doug himself is a really nice guy (I recognized him from watching the No Reservations episode). The food is awesome: I had the duck hot dog with foie gras, the Sonoran, and the Buffalo one (it was filled with blue cheese and deliciousness). OK, i shared these with my fiance, but they were all amazing.My only recommendations if you go to Hot Doug's are:1) bring a book/phone while you wait in line2) order 2 hot dogs for yourself3) order the duck fat fries4) Consume5) Achieve nirvana"
2550,"There is nothing I can write about my 3 experiences that has not already been covered. This place is a gem, and every single item I have ordered has blown my mind and my taste buds."
2551,"I found this place on yelp and have been dying to try it for awhile now. Finally tried it over the weekend and the reviews we absolutely spot on. Despite the long wait, everything was perfect. We will definitely be regulars here!"
2552,"I came to Chicago to visit for business and decided to wait it out in the wind for an hour to sample some unique dogs. They must be good if people will wait in the wind and cold for 1 hour right? Absolutely right! I had the wild boar, alligator, and the classic Chicago dog. The wild boar was hands down the best hot dog I have ever eaten. The alligator was also delicious. The Chicago dog was the best I had on my trip to Chicago. If you haven't been there yet, GO!"
2553,I would suggest Hot Doug's to anybody and love the creativity and quality of the menu and the personality of Doug while taking your order. It is a unique place that everybody should try at least once. But there are a lot of places in this city where you can get a great hot dog and some of the sausages I've tried have been great or just ok. I thought this would be a place I would go to as often as I could but have found myself sometimes passing it by for other options. Definitely try it out and see for yourself.
2554,"What can I say about Doug's that everyone else hasn't already said? It's amazing! I've been going for around 2 years now (minus that 7 month stint I lived in Brooklyn) and I'm so happy to see how popular the restaurant has gotten. (Not to mention wildly jealous that he hung out with Anthony Bourdain.)The long lines are a drag but it gives you plenty of time to catch up on all your Words With Friends games and ponder which specials will be up on the board that week. Or.. skip out on work, go to Doug's around 2:30pm mid-week, and there's generally never more than 10 people in line. I haven't read all 1,000+ reviews, so I'm sure it's been noted, but for anyone who has never been, don't try to run inside and snag a table while someone else in your party holds the spot in line. It's rude to every other person who is patiently waiting to sit down and feast, and you will be kindly asked to go get back in line and wait until you've placed your order to find a table. Just trying to save you the embarrassment! Oh and in the winter, notice that huge sign that says 'DON'T HOLD THE FRONT DOOR OPEN' and abide by it. 5 stars for Hot Doug's!ps; One time, I saw Doug totally out of his element at Comp World or whatever that place is called on Elston across from Target and it was like seeing a unicorn. Rare, but epic."
2555,"Delicious, but the buns aren't as good as they are at other places. Must try though. And make sure you have time for a nap later:)"
2556,"I love this place, but the line is ridiculous. Everyday is like this. I love the Duck Fat Fries, but it's only available on Fridays and Saturdays. I would give this place 5 starts if they would expand their restaurant and eliminate the long lines."
2557,"don't eat hot dogs. they're fattening, unhealthy and filled with god knows what. i mean....well, i deny eating hot dogs. if I make it myself in my kitchen it doesn't count.Hot Doug's is a w e s o m e. i rarely get into this area,but when i do, i like to go here and indulge in fattening unhealthy yumminess.."
2558,"The food is defintely to write home about. The dogs come in a variety of 'spice' levels and are reasonably priced. the fries in duck fat are to die for and i am a huge fan of them. the atmosphere is very cool as wellthe reason i cant give 5 stars, is due to the WAIT. it is ridiculous to have to wait so long for anything. it feels like a ride @ Great America @ times. The place is always packed and can get loud and crampy as you might imagine.Overall, a great place though!"
2559,"If there is one thing I miss about America... this is it.My friend started taking me here this summer and... oh man. I don't even know where to begin with how delicious and wonderful this place is. We always get there pretty early to avoid an incredibly long line, but I'd even go there if I had to wait two hours. It's so worth it! Doug is amazing and is so friendly that your wait seems like it never happened. The specialty menu is divine, along with their everyday dog and sausage offerings! I've had so many things now I can't even remember, but I always love getting a boring ol' dog with celery salt, tomatoes, and onions. Yum!I'll go back there any time I'm home. Love it, love it. The music is always good, too!"
2560,When does food take your breathe away? When you eat at Alinea. I brought my husband here to celebrate his big promotion. We both had the tour and I'm pretty sure it's changed our lives forever.
2561,"Service was excellent! Food was excellent. My husband and I split the steak and Shrimp DeJogne Many foods to choose from, Desserts were good, too - highly recommended! ..."
2562,This is my favorite special occasion restaurant. It is definitely a culinary top chef theater for the taste buds. It is expensive but worth every penny. Out of the super high end restaurants in Chicago it is the best one.
2563,"This review is not about the restaurant nor the food. I'm just going to comment on the service i got when i was at Alinea.Excellent service. At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to my needs and they were really very respectful and very prompt.I love it here, the food may not be that delicious as the other restaurants but the service is what will make people come back."
2564,"An experience unmatched. We dined at Trio when Grant was the executive chef there and were blown away. Alinea is somehow even better. We found the staff to be extremely gratious and educational which is necessary if you want to get the most out of this experience. And the food is fantastic. The presentation is entertaining, to say the least. The creativity of the chef and his team is unparalleled. And everything tastes amazing! Even the dishes I was convinced I wouldn't like melted in my mouth. For those without huge expense accounts, it's worth saving up for!"
2565,"Service was acceptable for a high end place, though to be honest I find it awkward when people try to push in my chair or replace my napkin anyway.The decor is nice, especially the entrance. When you step into Alinea, the hallway shrinks towards the far end producing a very Alice in Wonderland type effect. Appropriate considering the highly creative dishes that are served.If you really love food, have the money to spend, and want something adventurous, I highly recommend Alinea. Otherwise, don't go. Many of the dishes are definitely hit or miss, and it's not fun to spend a chunk of change on twenty small courses, only a third of which you like. That said, I had a good time. I had the touring menu. Although I don't think this always happens, Chef Achatz came out to my table and painted the table with an edible dessert. Very cool."
2566,"Best restaurant in Chicago by far! From the moment you walk in it is a beautiful journey. I was nervous because I just dined at Moto, and it was poor at best.The inside of the restaurant is breath-taking. The service and food is impeccable. The servers were not in my face, but if i needed something they were right there to help. There were different homemade breads with every course just getting better and better. Moto needs to take notes on how to cook and execute! I opted for the 22 course because my husband insisted, but I was so enthralled that we did. It lasted about 4+ hours, but went by so fast. I have only heard about the hot potato cold potato- and i still am thinking about it! I asked the server if the chef could sign my menu, and he DID!! Truly, a memorable experience i will never forget!"
2567,Had a great dinner meeting here recently when traveling to Chicago. Very creative presentation and excellent foodie delights.
2568,"Mmmmmmmmmmmm! Alinea was a gastronomical love story with a happy ending. By no means is it cheap but for the ultimate foodie experience, you have gotta try to this place. Presentation is amazing and everything just wows. I am definitely going to save up to eat here again."
2569,"I am writing this months after i ate here, but this was the most perfect meal I have ever had. I went with two of my friends and we all got the tour menu. Service was spot on and more importantly, the flavors were spot on. Of the 26 items that I ate, i liked all of them except for one, and that's because it had white asparagus in it. I just personally don't like white asparagus, but i know enough about food to know that the flavors in the dish work well together and taste good together. I did drop a bundle on the meal, but it was well worth it. Don't worry about the price, go to Alinea for the experience."
2570,"I have been really wanting to come here and glad to have the chance. I brought a business client with me and we had a phenomenal experience. The service was great, dishes innovative and the atmosphere lovely. Pricey but worth it."
2571,A bit over-hyped. Too many sweet courses on the tasting menu. But overall an interesting and enjoyable experience for the senses.
2572,"Can I really not give it 5?All the givens of a place like this are givens: brilliant service, perfect aroma as well as aromatics, and impeccable food.From the myriad of sensations of the first bite of fish roe to the powdering of a new take on A-1 Sauce all the way to slurping bubble gum tapioca from a straw, there is not a clunker in the menu. The experience is all you would expect and wish for, guaranteed. As for the boring, but all-important detail: I opted for the 12-course tasting, and it was plenty.I have nothing left to say. It really is a woohoo!"
2573,Grant always shows the best. His presentation and flavors with a flair like no other in Chicago.again a great meal.This is a great place to go consistantly.
2574,"This place is for the nouveau riche... Plainly and simply the most pretentious excuse for dining I've ever experienced. I'm not quite sure what all the raving over this place is about... is it a status thing, to say that you've dined there? The only thing I really enjoyed about the experience was the service and the atmosphere. Yes, the preparation and presentation of the dishes are creative and unique, but I'm still missing something, something I really don't care all that much to get."
2575,"From the first step to the last, Alinea is a must for educated foodies...The service was absolutely perfect and the food was mind bending! If you have the time and money, treat yourself to the 24 course wine pairing. This is the place you imagine taking people that you would love to impress...I went with three very solid chefs and we were blown away by the food, wine and service. We went to L20 the next night and were soooo disappointed I thought two of the three guys were going to walk out! Do not waste your time or money on L20. Go to Alinea and get a true memoriable experience!"
2576,"If anyone out there is looking for a justification to the arm and leg paid for a dinner at Alinea, let this be it. Although the cost of one dinner at this place may not be so easily digested, let me assure you it is an experience worth having. To be completely honest, I was nervous about eating at Alinea for the first time. My boyfriend and I decided to prepare for a night of food sin. We did the 25-course meal, the larger of the 2 choices. We were pleasantly surprised, after walking through the spaceship-like entrance, to be seated in a very intimate white room, much resembling the family room in my grandmother's house. The room held about 6 small tables seating 2-4 people. The wait staff was very informative and friendly, humoring us and our lack of knowledge of the wine selection with background information about the vineyards and years of all the wines and even some fun information about special curing of a couple of the wines. The food itself was incredible. Even if you are not blown away by the flavor of each and every course, there is a lot of thought and work going into every dish which is very apparent. There is at least a respect factor involved. Every course started with an in-depth description of the course and instructions on the best way to eat it. I don't want to spoil any of the surprises, but I WILL say the dishes tend to touch on all the senses. It is obvious that all senses have been thoroughly considered in the creation process. The quiet and calm environment, in which there is purposely no background music, was very relaxing and my boyfriend and I were able to fully enjoy each other's company as well as this esculent adventure. I definitely recommend that the foodies and appreciators of food art experience this restaurant at least once in their lifetimes. There are a couple of funny surprises towards the end of the dinner. If my description of the restaurant sounds at all stuffy, let me assure you that it is not. I had a great, fun, unforgettable experience at Alinea. It was what I expected it to be and more. Go for it, it's worth it! I promise."
2577,"My special lady took me here for my 30th birthday. Believe the hype- this place is UNBELIEVABLE. The food (to-die-for delicious, inventive, unique), the service (friendly, helpful, attentive), the ambiance (gorgeous, serene, peaceful)... this place has everything, and does everything perfectly. You simply cannot top the experience of a night at Alinea!"
2578,"I'm not sure I even need to review this place since it has so many glowing reviews, but hot damn...the food is an epiphany. Seriously, if you're into gustatory hedonism, this place is heaven. This is the kind of restuarant that has helped establish Chicago as one of the most important culinary cities in the world. And I mean WORLD!"
2579,good food nice price clean place loved the atmospher but not the service
2580,hi this is deepak.this products is exellent
2581,Wonderful! I will come back here with my friends.
2582,The only better restaurant I could think of could possibly be... El Bulli's. Possibly.
2583,"Wow. I mean, what else can I say that hasn't been said already? Everything about the place is absolutely top-notch. Food: The best meal I've ever had and my first experience with molecular gastronomy. The presentation was fantastic and with a clear focus on form over function (i.e. eating rabbit loin off a smoking maple tree branch). We did the twelve course tasting w/out the wine pairing and I was uncomfortably full afterwards. I can't imagine doubling that up. Service: Extremely professional and much friendlier that I had anticipated. I expected snooty but everyone was very nice and extremely helpful and did a great job of everything from helping us pick out a bottle of wine to describing the dishes and answering our questions.We went in October and a few of the dishes definitely had a fall focus so I would love to go back and see, no wait, taste how the menu changes with the seasons."
2584,"WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Amazing. I took my girlfriend here for our 3 year anniversary about a month ago.... The best! Now, obviously, this is a dining experience for a special occasion, eating here regularly, I would be homeless, but worth the great evening. I have never seen food prepared in such an art like style, very impressive. I will be back for the next special occasion in my life. You should go."
2585,"As a member of the James Beard Society; a self proclaimed gourmand; having eaten at 3 star Michelin and 4 star US restaurants, this was truly the most innovative dining I have ever experienced. Of the 13 courses there were maybe 2 that did not knock me off my seat. And one was the plainest: a piece of somewhat chewy lamb with potatoes. The other was a duck confit in a mole sauce. Fair. But the presentation will remain with you for life: they served this course on a pillow of air that released its essence when the plate was carefully placed on the pillow. Smoke essence engulfed the nose and palette. The duck was good but not great.Overall I'd give this restaurant a 99 and truly rate it as the finest dining experience of my 65 years. Liquid balls of butter or grape juice that would burst with flavor when either pricked with the tine of your fork or the roof of your mouth.. explosion of flavor..A simple WOW.BTW: it was the most expensive dinner ever. the 12 course meal is $145 pp plus wines, water, tax (at 11.25%!) tip; etc. we had 3 glasses of champagne -- $18 each. Then a bottle of Vouvray at $45 (one of the least expensive wines on list and delicious). Wine pairings are available at 75% of the dinner price. Add a 20% tip with the 11.25% Chicago tax and you add almost 1/3 to the total bill. It is worth it for a very special occasion.Enjoy...the Burgermaven"
2586,"HiWent to the most amazing restaurant in Chicago, Alinea. Check out their website.If you look at the menu we had the tour. Outrageous! Check out the gallery, look at the food. One example: a covered soup tureen. In it a spoon balanced across the bowl. In the spoon as small serving of seafood. Under it- two slices of japanese cedar burning and smoking the food. another example: parmesan cheese run through a seltzer bottle to create a foam, then frozen. Melts in your mouth and tastes like the most intense parmesan you've ever had. They make their own utensils most of which is quite unusual. The experience is best described as abstract art as food."
2587,"in a word...delicious..everything was perfect..the food, the presentation, the wine, the host, the waiter, the decor, etc...i smiked from the moment i walked in to the moment i went to bed. so wonderful. looking forward to my next night out there."
2588,"Alinea is outstanding! The food, atmosphere, presentation and service was superior! Truely an amazing experience!"
2589,"A cutting edge experience for lovers of food, art and romance. Doesn't matter if you decide to do the tasting (12 course) or the tour (24 course) menu, you will be blown away by the presentations. I have to say not all dishes, flavor components or pairings had worked perfectly for me, but at least I can appreciate the thoughts and creativity behind each dish. Expect the unexpected."
2590,"Like most other reviewers, Alinea also blew me away. Every dish was beautifully thought out to amaze all senses. The experience including the wine pairings was worth every penny. If I could afford to I would come here for every special occasion."
2591,"We had the 12 course meal with the wine pairing. All the dishes were so interesting, the presentation stunning! The bite-size portion was perfect and the special dishes were one of a kind. Some things popped in the mouth, spilling out interesting flavors. The wine pairing was good at times and seemed unmatched at other times. But to be truthful, the food wasn't as tasty as I was expecting it to be. Or maybe my expectations were too high."
2592,Delicious! What an incredible menu....absolutely perfect dining experience. I can't wait to go back again. Perfect place to bring a date.
2593,"I haven't stopped thinking about, dreaming about Alinea!!!! I had the tasting menu and I loved every course--the service, the presentation, the flavor, oh, the flavor and did I mention: THE FLAVOR! Simply the best!The next occasion or event you know where I'll be!"
2594,"This place is great, food is amazing and I never had a bad experience there. Service is very good and attentive, they know everything about wine. I had the 8 course tasting menu last time I went and it was fantastic. There is really nothing I can say about this place, but to go and try it yourself"
2595,If you like uppidity duppity with a side of complete disgusting food go here.
2596,"beyond outstanding, service, wine, dessert. Ill have my birthday there every year"
2597,I liked it very much ! great food and service.
2598,"It was good, but it can be better ,And 24 courses is just too long."
2599,"It was good, but it wasn't better than Trotter's, unless you are into the gadgets. And 24 courses is just too long."
2600,WOW Outstanding Im speechlessMake reservations
2601,"I picked this place for a friend's birthday, and NO ONE was disappointed! Food and presentation was amazing, same as the service.My favourite part was the dessert plated on a monkey sculpture, and the dessert cart at the end which loaded with small french treats!! I was so regret that I was too full to try every single item on the cart. Will def go back on a special occasional to impress friends/family again!"
2602,"I have been a lurking member of Yelp for years. Using it to find wonderful restaurants. This is the first time that I have been so blown away by a restaurant that I was moved to write a review.We had the tasting menu. Each course was spectacular, We kept thinking how can it possibly keep getting better. It did. The service and attention to detail is impressive.We will rush back."
2603,this place is magical. a real treat in the windy city.
2604,"Great Experience! Pricey but good food, is a three hour dinner. Service was amazing."
2605,"This was great! The tasting menu is the way to go. Comparing it to my gold standard, Alinea, it would get 4.5 stars. The presentation was fun-one dish had dry ice giving an artistic effect. The cheese course was amazing!!! The extra effort for our anniversary was appreciated. They brought us menus with our names and date on it as well as a Happy Anniversary in chocolate and a little cake."
2606,"The dining experience was good overall. But when you're spending this kind of money you need to be blown away. Given the coinage we dropped here, this place was a disappointment. I'm sure that people will drone on and on about how great this place is, but it's the Tim Tebow of restaurants. Totally over-hyped."
2607,"Maybe I'm out of date, but I love the look of Tru. The separate room for cocktails leads to a bit of drama when you are brought into the main room to be seated. The room is just pure class, very impressive.Service was outstanding, as we expected. The wine list was really interesting here, too.My only complaint was...the food! My meal was outstanding, but my three companions had mediocre to disappointing entrees. Maybe the mistake was not going with the tasting menu. We normally would, but were reluctant because we didn't want to spend 3 hours eating dinner (we had a late seating). Everything looked really pretty, but my companions dishes were just kind of blah. Not what you want from a restaurant like this.I still give Tru four stars, because the experience was great (and my meal was really good, even if my friends' meals weren't)."
2608,"Oui! This is ultimate high end comfort food. if you go, do the grand collection with a wine pairing which is a great value. You get to enjoy (2 oz pours) of some very special wines like 1985 vouvray moelleux le mont domaine huet . It is an $85 retail price chenin blanc that I could sip all day..I agree the dated and muted ambiance leaves something to be desired but the food and staff quality speak for themselves."
2609,"Truly a wonderful restaurant, great food and impeccable service. A much deserved 3 star michelin rating. Highly recommended"
2610,"Maybe a bit past it's prime of a few years ago, but still an excellent choice in the Windy City. Food presentation is a stand-out."
2611,"You could not pay me to go back to this place. The server was absolutely horrible. I have never experienced anything so uncomfortable and never been treated so terrible in my life. The amount of money we spent was fine, however, the food was not even that good and the server actually talked crap about us in the corner the entire meal. For that money, i should be at least told 'thank you'. Not to add drama, but it was my mother's birthday (she is a chef) and her only request was to have dinner here and she even got a hotel to come. She was disappointed and my father was insulted by the wait staff. One star is too much. Never go."
2612,"A particular foreign songs starts playing in my head whenever I think about this restaurant. The song isn't important, but the experience is. You may think by the time you take your first step into the place that you're under-dressed, but that might have been just me and my significant other. That all changed the moment they greeted us. Such open, generous, genuine smiles will make you feel really welcome. once you're seated and they start serving your meal, you'd start thinking things are over priced, but as they keep on serving such delicacies on and on, you start to realize the amount of food that your going through. Imagine a table filled with delicious hors d'oeuvres, layer upon layer (in a neat way), all hidden away. Something like that. This is definitely the place for a romantic foodie date."
2613,"Come bid on a TRU Restaurant VIP Tour! http://www.cbhconline.orBidding ends June 17, 2011."
2614,"Based on some of the reviews, I made a reservation with some sense of being disappointed. TRU turned out to be one of the best meals that I have ever experienced, including creativity, service, and overall enjoyment. At first the atmosphere seemed a bit stuffy, and the coordinated water pourings a bit hokey, but as the evening went on I appreciated the attention to detail in both the service and food. The sommelier was great with a sense of fun. The 6 course tasting menu showed more creativity than Moto. On the whole, this was worth the money for an exceptional fine dining experience."
2615,Went here for my birthday dinner. AMAZING
2616,"I know everyone loves this place. I dined there with my family a few months ago. The atmosphere and service is great. But the food, nothing special in my opinion. Dessert was solid, but the other courses were not great, just okay. For the amount of money and reputation it carries, I was disappointed."
2617,"TRUly an amazing experience! We started with the caviar staircase and did the large tasting menu along with the wine pairing. Probably safe to say we won't be ordering caviar again anytime soon but still a fun, yet pricy, first experience. The 9 course tasting menu was unbelievable. It was by far the most adventurous meal we've eaten. The service was outstanding along with the ambiance. We will be back sooner than later."
2618,"This used to be our favorite - for truly special occasions. For years it was wonderful in all respects. Alas, it has fallen WAY DOWN - now it is just very expensive with only o k food. There are too many places close by that are much better. We won't be back."
2619,"My husband took me there for my 30th birthday and it was amazing! Beautiful decor, many people in the restaurant but still the environment is very pleasant and quiet. We had the best beef fillet, ever! Very friendly service, nice art. Just wonderful. Highly recommended!"
2620,"Great, great, great, creative menu, definitely a treat. I loved the atmosphere. The service is what makes this place stand out from many fine dining establishments in Chicago and New York, it was such fun to watch, like synchronized swimming. Impeccable. I loved having the menu with our anniversary date on it as well as our names, so sweet, and something to cherish and remember the night by. Fine dining at its best."
2621,"Excellent restaurant! We have been to Tru for dinner and for dessert. It is a great place to go for dinner, but I loved the dessert tasting. Who wouldn't want to enjoy course after course of dessert? Such innovative desserts as well as grown-up versions of childhood favorites. (Such as a miniature root beer float made from their own root beer). Lovely!"
2622,Oh my God. This has to be one of the best places I have ever had dinner. It's right up there with French Laundry.I went to TRU a couple years ago and never forgot it. The food was amazing and the service is the best! If you have the money you have to go!
2623,"I'll be honest and admit that while I don't eat out very often, I've eaten at many places in different locations and countries. Tru is my most memorable and favorite meal. Keep in mind that you're not just paying to have your food cooked, you're paying for your experience. If you have plans for after dinner, you'll want to allot the appropriate length of time. My dinner took literally three hours. My favorite part of the meal was definitely dessert and their cart with homemade treats was the best way to finish my meal. You may be like me and can't afford this type of dining experience all the time, but Tru is definitely the place for a special meal."
2624,"one of the most memorable dining experience.old school/classic chicago.from the food to impaccable service, every thing was just great!a spot-on.It may look expensive and feel expensive.and yes it is pricey.but, in the end, it is such a bargain.best bread/pastry couse. spot on amuse-bouche.generous cheese couse.even amazing coffee!and they have by far the best dessert menu in the city.I am not a steak person, but Tru converted me.perfect for every occasion.ambience could seem little dated, but it's classy.can't go wrong with anything on the menu.wine list could use little more affordable wine though.don't forget your jacket.you will need them."
2625,Tru is among the Chicago elite in restaurants. Featuring glass staircases of caviar and other eclectic twists on nouveau cuisine. The menu is constantly changing and is dependent on seasonal availability of items. The decor is dramatic with dark rich black tones coupled with crisp white tablecloths and hints of blue accents. Tru is very adult oriented so not a family place but great for a small group or date for those who have a global palate.
2626,"I have a long history with Tru. I've been trying to recreate one of the most memorable dining experiences and one of the best dishes for the last seven years to disappointingly medicore results. As a consequence, I cannot recommend Tru due to its inconsistency and high price. The sexy but overly theatrical wall street circa 1986 inspired decor is a bit much. There are one or two too many servers per table. This gang bang approach to service seems to only work well in Asia and I would recommend they scale it back here in Chicago. Very tasty desserts are a consistently great finish to the meal, however."
2627,"When in a major city for a work obligation...make it count! That is just what I did in going to TRU. I enjoyed the Grand Collection, which was superb! My favorites were the farm ricotta and corn agnolotti with burgundy truffle consomme and the glazed veal ribeye with spring garlic, asparagus and wild mushrooms. I allowed the sommelier to pair my courses. The Knoll Riesling was incredible. I am very pleased that I added the cheese course, which was perfect.I enjoyed watching the impeccable simultaneous service for parties larger than just one...which I was...just one. As a lone diner it would have been lovely if the staff had of broken character a bit and been more personable, but they were efficient and friendly...to a point. I felt comfortable enough to have enjoyed myself immensely. It was a fantastic indulgence and I feel grateful that this is not my usual dining experience....I appreciated it all the more for that.One last thought...as a lone diner in a large city...seeing a familiar wine on the list is like seeing an old friend and suddenly one doesn't feel so alone after all..."
2628,My friend dragged me to this place for lunch because she said it was incredible and it was...an incredible wait. I stood in line for almost 30 minutes for a hot dog. These people who wait here are nuts. I don't see how this is any better or worse then other hot dog joints. I chalk it up to herd mentality.
2629,"Canyou say delicous. When i wen to HOt Doug this weekend the first thing I though was who would pay $7 dollars for a regualr size hot dog, but when I saw the menu it had a variety of different hot dogs and choices you could choose from. The service was very very slow here but I believe every second was worth the wait! The people here were really nice and you felt like you were in a nice enviormnt even though lines were out the door. The store does not look that appelaing when you first look at it, but I can surely say the food really backs it up. I would more than likely go back becasue I can honestly say the food was delicous!"
2630,"Tru was the best combination of excellent food and incredible service. We went there to celebrate a birthday, and the staff made it a memorable and special event. In addition to the extreme attention to detail, the staff was welcoming and friendly. While expensive, I would definitely recommend Tru because I felt the food and service were superior to other fine dining establishments. I enjoyed the experience much more than Everest, and maybe even Alinea."
2631,"Definitely waited for almost two hours, but it was worth it. In addition to whichever inventive dog strikes your fancy, try the corndog (surprisingly our favorite) and get those decadent duck fat fries. Just do it. and don't be intimidated by the line - take a friend or your smartphone or a book and the time will pass reasonably quickly. Cash only."
2632,"Wow, what a huge disappointment after reading so many positive reviews. We really can't figure it out why so many positive reviews unless someone from the restaurant or friends are constantly updating reviews. I personally travel the world and I am always seeking my next dining adventure. I have never posted a review because I have never been so disappointed in a selection based on reviews.We dined at TRU, if you want to call it that, on May 15, 2010. It was to celebrate an Opera performance competition earlier in the day. We had traveled from Dallas and wanted to eat at what we thought was the top restaurant in Chicago, but we could not have made a poorer decision. I think people are caught up in the ambiance and service and not the food. I want food to explode in flavor in my mouth and most dishes we had one or two bites and sent them back, awaiting the next course. We arrived in the lounge about 30 min prior to our reservation, to have a drink before dinner. I am a scotch drinker, and about the only think cheap about me is that I do like Dewars scotch. They took our order and came back and told us that we do not have Dewars, so the next obvious question was what do you have, which he promptly struggled through. After a couple more babbles I asked if they had a scotch list, and the light bulbs went off and we were given a list. I asked for Glenlivet he brings be Glenfiddich... It was such an ordeal to start.We were seated promptly at our reservation time, and like most chose the Prix Fixe menu. Like most have said the service was outstanding, until we got our first sample courtesy of the chef. We each took one bite and I really wish I could remember what they called it but well it was tasteless. After this, we were brought a selection of breads to choose from which we both made different selections and well the bread was good. Now on to appetizers. We both chose different appetizers, and we both ate no more than three bites and sent them back. With the outstanding service we often questioned why they did not even ask, was it okay, as we were sending back almost the entire dish. Entrees proved to be the same. No taste, no spice, no wow this food is exploding in my mouth. It was comical to see the steak served with mashed potatoes! Dessert consisted of very small portions no larger than my pinkie and again we did not even eat the whole thing. Save the hundreds of dollars that you will spend. Personally I was actually scoping out the restaurant for an upcoming business dinner I will have in Chicago next month, but I am sorry that I tortured my date with this experience. If you want ambiance and service this is your place, just don't go for the food. We really did go eat again afterward, it was that bad."
2633,Impressive in all respects. Without a doubt the best service I have ever had in any dining establishment. The overall experience was amazing and will always be remembered. The food was very good but perhaps I fell prey to over-expectations as I don't typically frequent such amazing establishments very often. I am so glad we were able to get reservations.
2634,"This place has over 1200 reviews?! Wow, talk about word of mouth advertising. But it's amazing, I agree. Well worth the wait in line. Haven't had a sausage I didn't like here."
2635,"One of my husband and my favorite restaurant worldwide.Went there on our 7th, 9th and 10th year anniversary, never disappointed.Spent about $200.00 per person, though it was the best bargain in town.Their after-dinner pastry is simply amazing, can't wait til go back again."
2636,very good variety of hot dog flavors / combinations. buns could be better.
2637,A wonderful place to eat with excellent pairings of wine. Everything about the dishes are above par. Not much to say on such a perfect place to eat if your willing to throw down some lute. The desserts are the best part. Go for a truly special occasion.
2638,"I recently went back to Tru for the third time for a special occasion (anniversary). We wanted a truly special dining experience, and based on our previous two visits there when in Chicago, we thought this would be the place to go. I must say that I was disappointed. Compared with previous dinners there, the service seemed not as good as in the past and the menu was spare on fresh fish and vegetable choices. So while I would have rated them a 5 in the past, this time I can only give a 3.5. It is still a very good restaurant, but I don't think we will go back there. There are too many other outstanding places to try. I reserve a 5 star rating to mean that I recommend a place without any reservations at all and will certainly plan to return the next time I am in town."
2639,i have noooooooooo words to describe how amazing this place was! like paradise!!! and one of those fancy restaurants you see in the movies!!!!!!
2640,"I don't know what to say, other than, certain things are to be expected at higher end places - like higher standards in behavior from staff as well as the customer. Sometimes a server can seem a little uptight - but that's infact part of their job - to do their best. The food is impeccable. The staff is a genie in a bottle wanting to grant your every wish - even put your purse on it's own purse stool beside you. And for those that don't get that - don't go to TRU. A little pretentious - without a doubt, but that is the culinary style. And to be expected - like going to a Mexican restaurant, and expecting Mexican accents and possible diarrhea afterward."
2641,very good
2642,"We went here on a whim, last minute no reservations. After hearing about this place from friends and family, I was very excited to try the food. The experience overall was very nice especially the service; however, the food was good not amazing! Notables: hot chocolate shot - seriously rich and deep in flavor but not too overpowering coconut macroon - very sweet but not the kind that hurts your teeth.homemade chocolates - also very rich and intense in flavorpretty much anything dessert!The savory dishes although tasty were not very innovative. Of all the savory dishes, my favorite was the beef wrapped in proscuitto and the soy sauce they used for the sashimi (I swear it's different then the one I have at home- and I'm Asian! haha). Overall, a great experience with the ambiance and timely waitstaff but the food itself was definitely not worth the price tag. Can't wait to try Alinea and Trotters to compare :)"
2643,"I know lot's of people have strong opinions about this place. I just wanted to add a few things.Great stuff. I always try to get their very early and found this adds to my experience. I am not a fan of waiting Try going on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Additionally, Doug is a personable independent owner operator and I am pleased to support his fine joint!"
2644,"There's a lot of hype around this place. It is a good hot dog place and the variety is excellent. However, I will be a bit nit-picky. Why would anyone stand in line for 30 minutes for a hot dog? They are not THAT good.I think that the dogs are supposed to be good because of all the hype so everyone's brain is getting tricked.Service is fair - in and out and then get out we have more customers type of mentality. Yes they smile.Their hours of operation are not that good. Always closed. They make so much money, they close their doors whenever they want.I don't get the hype. I'll give them 4 stars cause the dogs were good, not great. People get over it, they are just hot dogs, man."
2645,"An amazing dining experience. We went to celebrate a milestone in a friend's career. We had the seasonal collection. My friend's wife is vegan. She called in advance and the kitchen made all of her food vegan. Service was excellent. At one point, my friend's wife was cold. One of our attendants noticed and came over with a selection of shawls that matched her dress. Also loved the chair for my purse."
2646,Great anniversary dinner!
2647,"Ridiculously expensive. The food was good, the service was good, not great, and I don't like feeling ripped off. The staff must be laughing at the clientele for wasting so much money."
2648,"I really did not like my experience at Tru. The atmosphere is weird. It is so bright, that you feel like you're in a lab, not a 5 star restaurant. there is no music. There are 3 servers waiting next t your table, so you can't have a private conversation. It is too uptight. The food was nice, but not spectacular."
2649,"The food is above average, service excellent, but the chairs were uncomfortable, atmosphere a little stuffy (picture lots of 50 yr old men with 24 yr old blonds), and the valet staff make a comment to us when we tiped them only $2. Parking is pretty much valet parking only in this Northwestern Hospital neighborhood and Jacket required."
2650,"nice place, will go again"
2651,"I went there on a Friday at 2 pm and it was packed. Waited an hour and twenty minutes. It was worth every second. You get in there, and one side of the wall is the menu and all the specials, and the other side is pictures of sausage and hot dogs. And when after all the time spent in line, Doug is there to take your order. I ordered a large drink, and he politely told me that there is free refills on the small drink. I got the Alligator Sausage (which I split), The Apple and Cherry Pork Sausage w/ dried fruit, some manchego-esque cheese, and sweet curry mustard, with an order of duck fat fries. My friends got the corn dog, bratwurst, hot dog, and regular fries. Everything was off the charts good. I would never imagine mixing shrimp sauce with a smoked alligator sausage. But the stand-out to me was the pork sausage. The flavors mixed and matched so perfectly and there was nothing better to wash it down with than some duck-fat fries and a gulp of Mr. Pibb. Suffer through the lines, and make sure you go on Friday or Saturday."
2652,"EXCEPTIONAL IN EVERY WAY.DO EXPECT: Impeccable, formal service; Outstanding, original cuisine; Excellent options for vegetarians (including the tasting menu); Staff who are passionate about food and wine; Great suggestions for wine-pairings; To be surrounded by beautiful art (on your way to/from the bathroom, ask a staff member for a little guided-tour of the art pieces); A stool for your handbag(!).DON'T EXPECT: A cheap evening; Ultra-friendly servers (unless you're seated at the kitchen table, where the experience does feel more relaxed, but no less wonderful)."
2653,"Lived in Chicago six years and finally went to Hot Doug's - not sure what the big deal is supposed to be. Awful line with 90% non-locals, not a terribly good neighborhood, etc. Again not sure why Hot Doug's is a big deal."
2654,"Service was Awesome! Synchronized water refills! 4-5 waiters for just our table! The dessert and the Madeleine Cookies to go were the best. The prixe-fix food itself was visually incredible, but so-so on the palette. She was impressed, however, I wouldn't go again unless they improved the menu."
2655,"This place is just ok. it would get a higher rating from me if i didn't have to stand in line that long. Did they cook my dog when i showed up? They must have because it wasn't hot by any definition, i would say warm. The fries are ok as well but not for my taste, i like crispy thin cut fries, and these were a little on the thick side and all mushy from being in too much grease. The price isn't expensive but two of us had dogs, shared a fry, and had two drinks. I remember the price being almost $20 which it was after i put the change in the tip jar ( I always tip). I have two other favorite hot dog spots that i would never dare mention because if i had to wait that long for a hot dog again I am moving out of the city, maybe even state."
2656,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Got there when it opened and waited in line for 45 minutes and it was well worth the wait! The duck fat fries are the richest thing I've ever eaten.Amazing, amazing food. I live outside of the Chicago area and I'll be back to Hot Doug's whenever I'm in Chicago for the rest of my life."
2657,good dogs! THE fries are the best
2658,"Overpriced, small portions--they actually served me a dish that was the size of a tablespoon. My boyfriend was disappointed as well--but at least he paid! The owner also supports torturing geese to make foi grai!"
2659,best hot dogs in Chicago.
2660,their fat fries are AMAZING... definitely try this place!
2661,The Ultimate Hot Dog Superstore. Love it!
2662,"I feel a little intimidated to even write a review about this place. I truly believe it is one of the greatest places (perhaps THE greatest) place to get food in Chicago.Don't let the line that wraps around the place turn you away. Bring a book or something, because the wait is WORTH IT!I love that the owner, Doug, takes every person's order.I love that they change their specials frequently- it keeps me coming back for new things to try and for some reason makes me think the food is fresher.I love the quirky, non-threatening atmosphere.Ask for Doug's recommendation, and he will probably tell you to get the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli and the Foie Gras Mousse. It is incredible. But the other specials have always been just as mouth-watering.My advice, go with a bunch of friends. That way, you have people to hang out with in line. And then everyone could order a different special and get to try a little bit of everything."
2663,The food is amazing! Great place to try something out of the ordinary. The food is very gourmet but with a streetlike twist. And Doug takes your order!
2664,I never thought I would wait 30min in line to get a hot dog but apparently I will be doing it from now on. Doug makes a mean wien.
2665,"This place is heaven for a born and raised Chicagoan! Doug, you are so nice and always give the best service available, thank you! Your staff is also very sweet! The dogs at Hot Dougs are absolutely amazing. What I love about this place is the variety of ways you can eat a dog. The different dressings and the way the dog can be cooked are great, options, options, options! The best is their Chicago style dog. Words cannot express! You must try this place."
2666,"My husband and I go to Doug's more or less weekly, now. We generally get whatever is on special and something else. We go at the off hours and haven't waited for more than 20ish minutes yet.But we have not gotten to try the duck fat fries. We don't go when they're on, as we know it'll be a madhouse. Someday."
2667,"Seriously...what is all the fuss about? I've routinely had better hot dogs in people's back yards, at BBQs. I went with 2 other people, and we ordered a wide variety of 'dogs so we could try many of them--not one was memorable. The 'dogs themselves are seriously lacking in flavor, and the startlingly neon green relish is totally void of all flavor. The only redeeming factor about the whole meal were the french fries--otherwise, this joint would be getting 1 star from me. Maybe it's just me. I'm an east coast gal, and I had the same reaction to Al's Italian Beef (also lacking in flavor)--which a ton of native Chicagoans implored me to try. In sum, I wouldn't wait in line for 5 minutes for these hot dogs, let alone the 1.5 hours we spent in line waiting for them. Hot Doug's is a Hot Food Failure."
2668,"Awesome hot dogs! Friendly staff all around. A little bit of a wait depending on when you go, but its worth it!"
2669,"Excellent food, good atmosphere, friendly service. Worth the money, worth the wait, lives up to the hype."
2670,"Sometimes I randomly crave their Seoul Sassy chicken. Crisp is probably hands down my favorite restaurant in the city. I'm from Hawaii, so I'm really judgmental of Asian food. The only other equivalent to the Seoul Sassy chicken is the Korean Fried Chicken from Zippy's in Hawaii, and let's face it, Crisp might be better and is so much closer. I love this place because it has great food, especially for the price. Everyone who has eaten at any Korean restaurant knows that Korean food is not cheap.My boyfriend and I usually split the whole chicken combo for $19.99 (comes with 2 cans of pop and 2 sides). It's perfect for sharing and sometimes we'll have enough for one lunch the next day."
2671,So very good. Will return!!!!
2672,"This is so yummy. Try the Seoul and Sassy. There was lots of flavor!!! I didn't really care for the tables. Honestly I am not a big fan of sitting with other customers. I value my personal space. Other than that, I love the food. Will be back again. Possibly for take out!"
2673,"Crisp is hands down awesome. Their BBQ chicken wings are perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of fried. I also highly recommend the Magic Mushrooms, which are battered and fried and come with Crisp's amazing dipping sauce. The staff is friendly and laid back and the food comes out pretty quickly. Love this place!"
2674,"These may be the best wings I've ever eaten in my life. My wife and I stopped in after seeing BMG and we ordered 10 wings and a steak bowl. It was more than we could eat! The wings are so big that the drumette portion is bigger than some actual drumsticks I've seen. I'd be afraid to meet that chicken in a dark alley...We had half sassy Seoul and half BBQ and both were delicious. The steak bowl has excellently seasoned bulgogi-style beef and perfect rice. I think a five-piece wing or a bowl would be plenty for one person (either one is around eight bucks).It is a unique ambience - big slab tables and a couple of counters with bar stools. If you can get the window seat, though, it's great for people watching while you eat. This place is so good that we'll make a special trip downtown just to come here again."
2675,"If You find yourself in Lakeview then you have to try Crisp! Every single time I've been there which has been many my food is always hot fresh and tasty. The buddha bowls are to die for, packed with veggies and meat topped off with a fresh egg. The sauces are very Flavorful . The bibimbap is fantastic your sure to be a fan !Be sure to grab a seat before you order they get sat up fast!"
2676,"I recently tried Crisp for lunch. I had the Foodie's Choice Crisp, and my friend had a Buddha Bowl. Mine was delicious. The chicken was tasty, crisp, and tender on the inside. The sauce and toppings were also excellent. My only complaints were that the sandwich fell apart easily and it was just a bit too greasy. My friend enjoyed her Buddha Bowl, even though it was enormous. Seating is very informal but comfortable. I will definitely go back for more."
2677,"I'm eating as I type, and there is sauce all over my fingers and keyboard. It's the best sandwich I've ever had! THE FOODIE'S CHOICE CRISP is bursting with all of these amazing flavors. Given that my trip to Crisp was supposed to end with a small snack, saving the rest for later, I'm surprised to find that I just finished the whole thing. DELICIOUS! I'll be back!"
2678,When you think of BBQ and chicken the first thing i think of the Crisp. Their Sassy Chicken wing are one of the best in the city.This is a must try for any fried chicken lover in the Chicago land area!
2679,"Simple, reasonable priced, and exceptionally delicious. I've ordered a variety of items off their menu, and have only been delighted at what I've received.The chicken is incredibly crisp and moist, the bowls are reasonably healthy and full of flavor and the sides are up to par with the rest of the menu.A friendly staff and casual environment make this a great place to grab a bite in the Lakeview area."
2680,Why bother even writing a review. It's all been said. Delicious and inventive!This is the spot I bring my out of town friends to show off a Chicago gem!
2681,doug for president!doug for president!doug for president!doug for president!doug for president!doug for president!doug for president!
2682,Awesome!!! Baby buddha bowls are a great buy and delicious!
2683,HOT DOUG's GAVE ME FOOD POISONING.Went to Hot Doug's with two friends. We all got different Dogs/Sausages and shared a basket of the Duck Fat fries. My friend called me the next night to see if I was sick. I missed her call because I was in the bathroom vomiting. All three of us got sick. I will not be returning.
2684,"Love the food, but don't get delivery. delivery guy is rude. I have to pay $3.00 in delivery charge to get rude at my door step. No Thanks"
2685,Take Awesome...mix it with chicken wings and you get Crisp. Best Chicken Wings and Chicken Dinner... Love to eat here with all my friends and try out all their unique drinks. Their mushrooms... amazing. Their wings? Even better. Great location and the people are always talkative and fun to order from. Def feels like its a healthy dinner
2686,"Great Hot Dogs/Sausages, recommend going before 12 to beat the rush!"
2687,"I LOVE their fried chicken! The soul sassy is Sooo good!It's crispy and juicy too with reeeeeeally goos seasoning.We get carry out, I don't like the long benches where u sit next to strangers if you eat there.ONE OF THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN CHICAGO.They always have fast friendly service too."
2688,By far the best restaurant in Chicago...I cannot get enough of this place. Their Chitown bowl is delicious and their wings are sweet and spicy...oh and did I mention huge. A lot of food for your buck.
2689,No need to waste anyone's time with this review. This is just to confirm that Hot Doug's RULES!
2690,"Amazing. The wings are great, the sauces are better. Alden who works there is cool. Burritos and bowls are also pretty damn good."
2691,"My go-to place for wings. They give you WHOLE wings, not segments! The Seoul Sassy sauce is my favorite. The Original Buddha Bowl is good, but bring your appetite, it's a huge portion! I like that you can get brown or white rice, too. Just remember to bring cash... they don't take plastic."
2692,"Okay, so I probably came here over 20 times. IT IS SO EFFING GOOD IT WILL BE A MISTAKE TO NOT GO. That is all."
2693,OMG!!! This place has the best friggin wings!!!!
2694,"Drooling again, sorry, gotta wipe up my keyboard. I wanna go back to those duck fat fried cheese fries. And that chicago hotdog, with that fresh bread and lettuce, mustard mayo. ketchup. What I don't wanna go back to is that freaking line. I didn't think it would be that cold outside and the line so Long. The only time I can drop by is the same time those other people can drop by. You guys try staying outside in the could. Doug's - you better open up another local branch. I can wait for that. I can't stand going there and waiting in line out in the cold. I feel like a hobo lining up for a good meal."
2695,Yes. just four stars because there's zombies. Zombies who are waiting for duck fat fries and anything fried in duck. All those delicious sausages and hotdogs. I don't want to turn into a zombie and wait in line. Its a good thing I read through these reviews before dropping by. I planned by day so I could drop by during non-peak hours. No food is worth waiting two hours to get. Any place that causes a line to build up outside the shop needs to open another branch. Can I buy a franchise? I want to open shop and eat everything before its sold. Your menu to me is what brains are to a zombie.
2696,"This place is great for encased meats/sausages/whatever.. The line's a little bit ridiculous and I won't go as far as to say that this place is overrated, but waiting an hour for sausage and luke-warm fries didn't exactly live up to my expectations when standing outside for an hour on my bday. I'd still go back, no doubt about it, I'm just saying, the line's a bit much.."
2697,Best dogs in the city! Great service
2698,"best wings i have ever had in my life! i always bring people here and they all agree, crisp is the best! the wings are huge and all of the sauces are so good. pretty inexpensive too."
2699,Mark on Lake Shore DriveI was disappointed with the delivery that we had on Tuesday 10/25/11. When the food arrived it was cold my sandwich was very soggy and tasted bad. Our order was short one diet coke and we were charged for it. When we called Crisp they acted like it was our fault and we were talked down to. I don't recommend this place at all.
2700,"Wing heaven, Everyone i have introduced to these wings are hooked. I know the owner from when i used to work down the street from his burger joint. I love these wings, i could eat them everyday if i could afford it. the steak and rice bowl is also real good. I havent tried much else because there is no need to!"
2701,I've been here a few times and recently found myself wondering why I don't come here more often. The chicken is delicious. The wings are meaty and every sauce I've ever had here is fantastic. I really want to try the bowls next time I go. So if you are looking for some really tasty chicken with a twist and then you need to go here. Service is fast and friendly and it's BYOB.
2702,"Came across a show on Food Channel yesterday talking about this place so decided to give it a try. I love spicy food so went with the suicide wings. Sauce was definitely on par on my heat index but the chicken was average at best. It was a bit over cooked making it drier than it should. When that happens, most of the juice from the chicken is gone and can't blend with that amazing sauce. Kinda like eating chicken jerky drowned with hot sauce. But looks like they have other interesting items on their menu. Will definitely give them another try next time to see if they deserve an improved rating"
2703,"Please please open a place closer to Skokie or deliver out here, it sucks that I no longer work across the stress...those sassy wings remind me of some wings I had in Portland from a place called Pok Pok, a thai street food concept..which means some of the best wings I have ever had, damn crack wings..."
2704,"DANNNGGG!!!! THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE!!! Give me more! Buddha Bowl- Rice, veggies, choice of meat, hot sauce, sesame oil- my mouth is watery and my stomach is satisfied!Placed my ordered, got my food, ate my food- in under 30 minutes. Cash only"
2705,"This place lives up to the hype. I don't think any hot dog is worth a 2 hour wait, but I always go during non-peak hours.The duck fries are good but the hot dogs really steal the show. I love the spicy thai dog. I usually get 2 dogs and skip the fries.I have met some very nice people while waiting in line. It's really an experience at Doug's.Make sure you bring cash. Doug is very nice."
2706,"Crisp is about as good as you could get for the price. They have great wings and fried chicken as well as the best chicken sandwich in the city. Their seoul sassy sauce is killer. If you are in the area and are trying to figure out what to eat, walk over to Broadway immediately."
2707,"Not much to add that hasn't already been said! This place is amazing, I live in MA but travel to see family in Chicago frequency and make Hot Doug's a must for each trip! Lines can be long, but don't let it scare you, worth the wait. Prices are insanely cheap as well. Pretty sure I remember it being cash only."
2708,BEST SAUSAGES in town! I recommend you go here before you expire!
2709,"i find this place ok, you can find places like these all over the south side and a hella cheaper. The line thing and seating is crazy, now don't get me wrong the place has good food-but why wait for it! Im telling you good hot dogs in the city are not hard to find- so i dont wait in line!!!!"
2710,Their seoul sassy chicken wings are SOOO BOMBBB!
2711,"WOW...I am so surprised by how much I didn't care for the chicken at Crisp..It's not that I don't enjoy greasy fried chicken,,,,cause I do..but I normally avoid eating it, like at KFC, but had the desire to eat some fried chicken(maybe feeling anxious..I don't know). Anyway, I got the Plane Jane and a soda pop..1/2 chicken was the smallest I could get..It cost over $10 which was amazing to begin with.That's alot for fried boney chicken. I then sat down yesterday, Tuesday, and sat at a picnic table that was shared with other people around lunch. We all had to share these brown paper towel rolls, all with other people's greasy fingers on them as well...Im not a fancy person, but having my own individual napkin is like a minimum eating need that I have at a restaurant..Maybe this is how they do it in Korea, but not COOl at all..or sanitary. So,,the chicken was just completely unremarkable..Just crispy fried chicken..a little peppering I think..but just chicken..Not bready like KFC, just skin on chicken fried up. Maybe I should have added a few hundred more calories and got it with the BBQ or Seol sassy sauce to hide the taste of the chicken, but blowing my diet on fried chicken was bad enough. I ate about half, and threw out the rest. I would give the food a 1 star,,overpriced and not good. The servicewas friendly and fast, so that bumps up this BIG let down to a 2 star. WOW........"
2712,"food is awesome, dogs are the best, but the wait is too long. you need to open at another location to better serve your customers. ;)"
2713,"Crisp, when translated from Koren, means yay. At least, that's how I feel after each time I have a meal here. I was so excited when I discovered Crisp since Koreans are known in Asia for their fried chicken but it's not common knowledge in this country yet. I have my brother to thank for introducing me. I started going to Crisp when it first opened and the owner was still working the counter. He truly listens to his customers because I asked him why he wasn't carrying Milkies (which happens to be one of my favourite Korean beverages). Soon after, it appeared in their beverage coolers. The others who have since joined the Crisp team are stellar and I've enjoyed getting to know them as well.I have taken a tour around their menu and I cannot get past the Seoul Sassy wings and the Buddha bowl aka bi bim bop. Every time I introduce a new friend to Crisp, they are delighted. One of my best friends from NYC came to visit me soon after I had moved here from the City and I brought him to Crisp. He said that he had tried a sauce similar when he was in Miami and has been searching for that same type of taste ever since. It was here in Chicago when he was able to do so again. This friend happens to be someone I have had hundreds of meals with and never a bad one; his high praise echoed my sentiments. I cannot say enough how much I love Crisp. Try this place. I'm serious."
2714,"This was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. First and foremost the food was mind blowing fantastic. The music was exactly my style, but a bit too loud. The best part of the evening was when the chef came out with a huge box of fireworks and all the diners followed him out of the restaurant where he proceeded to blow them up just off the side street off of Ashland. It was a beautiful display that was sadly interrupted by the cops who hauled the chef away to the station! The rest of us went back into the restaurant and finished our meals. We were assured by the rest of the restaurant staff that they would be going to the station to bail him out. I have been fortunate enough in my life to dine at world class restaurants - but Schwa is probably the best restaurant I have ever been to hands down. The sheer brilliance of this chef is immeasurable. I highly recommend it and its worth the wait and frustration in getting a reservation."
2715,good food...innovative...nice staff
2716,"This is the place to get a sausage baby! Don't get a hot dog because its just a standard hot dog. But, get the duck sausage with foie gras and..........enjoy! Go on a rainy day after the lunch rush and you may only wait for 15 minutes. If you've never gone......GO!"
2717,I was just curious after reading everyone's wonderful reviews and seeing the challenges of making reservations (which seems well worth it)How far in advance to you start trying to make reservations?
2718,Great meal !!! If you like chicken wing you have to check this place out. I had lunch here with my brother and ordered the spicy BBQ sauce and the Seoul sassy. They both were very very good and tasty. They were nice crunch to skin. The meat inside was juicy. The batter was light and crispy. Also the price is reasonable.But small space.Definitely plan on being regular here !!!
2719,"I really wish I could offer a good review, especially after reading past reviews. However, when they call you on a Saturday afternoon to essentially say they don't feel like opening up that night, they should expect some knocks. Schwa, be quirky all you want - don't pick up your phone and only open when you feel like it - just don't expect that I'll ever be a customer."
2720,"1st the good. The guys(service) were good they were friendly but it seemed to me that as the night went on they were rocked, did see the shots flowing in the kitchen.The ambiance if you really want to call it that could have been better, I feel for the prices they charge they could have a better appearance. The music could be better not a big of rap so that doesn't help, but the volume was very annoying at times we couldn't hear each other and its a SMALL place. The food was good for the most part, they were a couple of items I could have skipped and few I could have more of. The Dr. Pepper thing didn't get it, guess it the chefs favorite thing, rice krispies treats really didn't hit the mark, I mean that something to do at home with the kids. The wife enjoyed it so I will do this like a colonoscopy exam don't want it, but its necessary once a year or every other yr. Its okay went you want something different but personally I like a bit more flavor, juices, in my food."
2721,"Korean fried chicken is muy delicioso!!! The sauces were tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. Just the way I like it. I do feel they're a little over priced for the actual portion size, but they definitely know their chicken. The staff is fun and quirky which fits the neighborhood. And I love that they have coat racks to accommodate their patrons during the fall, winter and spring months since their seating has a tendency to be a bit awkward (it's arranged as if you're joining a bunch of strangers at a hibachi grill). I hear the salad's are awesome and they're next on my list to try."
2722,"There's nothing I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. Quite possibly the only place in the city I'll wait in line! We tend to over indulge (if you're going to wait an hour, you have to order more than one dog....). And while we're enjoying the cholesterol fest, thrown in an order or two of duck fat fries.....why not! I've worked my way through the menu, and have yet to be disappointed. This is the ultimate hot dog: worth every single calorie, and every single minute in line!"
2723,the best meal I've had all year. Great atmosphere and food is just out of this world. Service is excellent.
2724,So good. I was sent here by the people at Apartment People. They were raving about it when I was signing my lease so I had to try it. Best fried chicken I have ever had. Chicken sandwich was just as good.YUMMM!!!
2725,"Three times I had reservations for a Friday night, three times the reservation was confirmed on Thursday and three times my reservation was cancelled last minute. This place might have awesoime food but it SUCKS!"
2726,"I really like these dogs, always a wait but also worth the wait. I usually bring out of towners here."
2727,Lemon Diesel Kush + Seoul Sassy Whole Chicken + More Lemon Diesel Kush = 2nd Step to Nirvana
2728,"I was part of a party of 4 for Friday, December 16. Two of the people in the group had birthdays that week, so we were there for their birthday dinner. We picked up some nice wine and found a parking spot right across the street, only to find out when we got there that they decided to close for the evening. No phone call, no one waiting at the door, just a hand-written sign on the front of the door.Now I know that stuff happens. And I know that this place is notorious for canceling reservations and being generally tough to get a reservation to begin with. However, not even bothering to call to let you know that your reservation has been canceled is inexcusable! I mean, the place is small, so how hard would it be to call the dozen or so parties you have booked for that night? A phone call in advance, while disappointing to receive, would at least have given us a chance to figure out an alternative with time to spare. Instead, we returned to our car and got on Open Table just to find a place that had an opening at 9 pm on a Friday night. And the sign on the door said they would make it up to us. How, exactly? We still haven't got a phone call asking if we'd like to reschedule. And considering how it took 12 times calling them to set the initial reservation, calling them now probably wouldn't get us anywhere.Based on the other reviews on here and word of mouth, I would love to delete this review and write one based on the food itself. However, since we weren't able to try the food, I will have to wait to do that. Until then, 1 star is too generous for a place that cancels your reservation and doesn't even bother to call you in advance."
2729,"Unbelievably, this restaurant called at 4pm today to cancel the reservation that we have had for six weeks. We had confirmed yesterday for a special occasion dinner. I understand that sometimes problems arise--but other reviews warned us this may happen. And calling within 2.5 hours of the scheduled reservation to cancel on a Saturday night??? We don't have a prayer of getting another reservation at this point... so disappointing. Needless to say, the offer to reschedule for another night is not one I will be taking up."
2730,"I ordered delivery and it arrived at my house literally 15 minutes after I hung up the phone (maybe I live too close for delivery and should have picked up myself..but it was rain/snowing..). I had the big buddha bowl with tofu which is huge, filled with veggies and super delicious. I also tried the fried mushrooms which were excellent. This will become a new regular spot for me!"
2731,"I have to agree with all of the other 900+ reviewers this place is awesome! You should be prepared to wait in line, sometimes for an hour or more but it is well worth the wait... even in our Chicagoland winters. The range of hot dogs is staggering, concoctions that I would never dream of but that are super tasty. There is a good reason they were featured on Food Network a few times, they truly are a Chicago landmark and best of all they are right next to Eagle Insurance, if you grew up in northern Illinois in the 1980's you will appreciate that reference."
2732,Well worth the price and it's BYOB. The wait to get a table took longer than I was hoping.
2733,"Best chicken wings!So unique flavor wings!Their spicy wing and sweet wing, both were excellent.I can not tell which ones better. You can order half and half. I tasted the limit of crispy chicken wings I never had before.Food was the best, but I give 4 stars, because the tables and the floors were not cleaned. Maybe so many customers there."
2734,Doug has the best sausages.Friendly service. Fun lines. There is nothing on this menu I don't love.Call the Doctor I need a bypass.A must for all
2735,Best place to get chicken and the buddah bowls are delicious.If your hungry this is the place to go. GReat freakin food..
2736,The Chi-Town bowl is the greatest ever! And always add an egg to it for some extra flavor. We live nearby and usually end up eating here once or twice a week. I actually get sad on Monday's when they are closed and I have a craving for chicken!
2737,"Well, if you read through the reviews you get the picture. Everyone who actually got to eat here gave 5 stars. Everyone who got the run around and cancelations gave 1. The food is some of the best around. It took quite a while to get in Schwa and we did have one cancelation but for the most part I think we got lucky. Once inside the food is every bit as good as advertised. Make of it what you will. The food was worth the headache to me."
2738,"Best Chicken wings in chicago, maybe further out than that."
2739,It is worth it every time I go.
2740,"I unfortunately had a reservation which I had to put a credit card number down for and have a 48 hour window to cancel. That part does not bother me. What bothers me is that when I needed to cancel, NO ONE answered their phones for about a week and their mailbox was full. When I finally got through the day before my reservations, the guy on the phone was extremely rude. I do not understand how a restaurant can be in business when they do not answer their phones; their voice box is full; and by canceling reservations last minute. I will not ever go there!"
2741,"They don't give me the option to give 0 stars. The service was absolutely horrific, let alone the chicken wings. I went after reading the spelndid reviews with my significant other and boy was I WRONG.Korean Chicken? I think NOT! If you want decent chicken go to Popeyes or KFC. Overpriced with awful sauces mixed in. Our table was filthy with trash left from other customers. The staff was also playing hardcore rock music.... In a so called Korean RESTAURANT. DO NOT COME TO CRISP. It's a sham all of you who have reviewed this with 5 stars are idiots and need new taste buds.ENJOY!"
2742,"How can you dine at a restaurant with an open mind after it has canceled the day of your reservation THREE consecutive times? I can't and will not. My friends and I have had a table for four at Schwa three different times all to be canceled on the day-of. The first two cancelations were both within two hours of the reservation and the third cancelation was four hours before we were due there. Thank goodness I wasn't entertaining business associates or guests from out of town. This behavior is unacceptable, disrespectful, and untolerable. Instead of taking our wallets to Schwa we will continue exploring Chicago's culinary scene elsewhere."
2743,"I fucking love this place. I work in Lakeview (hence, all of the reviews of establishments in the neighborhood, despite the fact I live about four miles west of there) so I get to eat here about once a week. First, and most obviously, the chicken is tops. Being the whitest of the white-boys, I don't know much of anything about Korean food. Hell, I'm not even sure if this is real Korean food. And, what's more, I don't give a fly-on-the-back-of-a-cow-at-100 miles an hour's ass. It's friggin perfect.I might even go so far as to say that dollar for dollar, this is the best food I've ever had. And the Sriracha sauce on the table... well, huge bonus. Beyond all of that, well, the staff here is totally cool. I always feel welcome and recognized. Crisp once accidentally double-charged my debit card for a meal: Not only did they credit my card, they gave me my next meal for free.On several occasions, I've gotten 4 chicken strips when my order calls for 3.Oh, and seriously, these guys listen to the coolest music of any establishment in the neighborhood.Keep it up, Crisp. And, since I'm not going to work in Lakeview forever, I think you should think about opening a second location... about four miles west of the original."
2744,we enjoyed everything!
2745,Crisp is delish! The wings are massive and amazing and the budda bowls are yummy! I've never had a burrito so I can't comment. The restaurant is BYOB which is great. Parking is street parking on busy Broadway so that can be tricky. Seating for groups can be difficult if going during peak hours of lunch or dinner - picnic table style. It's not fancy but it's great food!
2746,"So I have to say that I registered just so I could review this restaurant. As I started looking through reviews, I realized that I am not the only one who is pissed about the treatment by the management. Not only did our reservation get rudely and inconsiderately cancelled an hour before our reservations, but two of my friends had the same experience independently the subsequent weekend. The worst and most pathetic thing is that the management keeps coming up with ridiculous excuses for cancellations. I didn't realize the complete disregard that the restaurant has for their patrons. There are plenty of good restaurants in Chicago on the same level so there is absolutely no need to try to go to this one. I am certainly never coming there after knowing what I know."
2747,"The wings were definitely not crisp, they were soggy and the sauce was completely generic. The guys behind the counter were also eating the whole time and talking to customers with their mouths full. If the trend is 'bad', this place could be called trendy."
2748,Stupid place. Never coming again.
2749,"Really good jumbo, Korean-style, fried chicken, Their bibimbop is also a great compliment to the chicken, and it's authentic (I'm half Korean). They just lose star for having hard napkins so be prepared to bring your own."
2750,"After two weeks of calls (the answering machine is routinely full) my girlfriend was able to get us a reservation for the night of my birthday. She spent the day selecting and then decanting three wines. Our reservation was for 5:30 p.m on a Friday. At 4:40 or so the phone rings and it is Schwa. Like so many other people who have posted here, we were simply told that the Chef would not open that evening. We are in shock. They promise to call on Saturday to find another time for us to come in. They do not call. Never did. While others seem content with this behavior (Chef apparently does this on a regular basis) I think it is terrible. No one would put up with a band that cancelled concerts at the last minute -- and without explanation. Perhaps Chef is an artist -- but he seems to overlook one of the most important rules in life -- you need to show up."
2751,"I moved to the States 11 years ago from Korea and I have tried many Korean restaurants. Mostly Galbi places so when I found Crisp, it was a pleasant surprise. The Buddha bowls are great!! I usually order a small bowl with an egg, and my hubby gets his with meat and we share a whole order of Seoul sassy fried chicken. The hot pepper paste for the Buddha bowl is a little on the sweet side. Every time I am near that neighborhood, I make sure I get my korean fix. Reasonable price, clean atmosphere and great food!"
2752,"Our meal at Schwa was a masterpiece, with mouthwatering courses, perfect service, and yes, a crazy atmosphere. I flew in from Miami to meet one son from Milwaukee and another from LA for a gustatory week and it was indeed, the high point, even considering our meal at Alinea and Topolobompo. I did call 200 times to get the reservation and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Michael and his brother, Seth and the rest of the crew made us feel like beloved family and gave us a memory we'll never forget and hope to repeat. It takes culinary genius to create the dishes and warm and open hearts to give us such a superlative experience. Get your dialing finger ready! You'll be glad you did."
2753,"Crisp. Great wings, relaxed atmosphere, and to die for Seoul Sassy sauce. The only negative thing about this place is when you walk in and get a to-go order there is no where for you to stand. Everywhere you walk you get in someone's way. The foodie special sandwich is also a real winner. I have not tried their bowls yet because I am hooked on the wings. Very relaxed staff that works there."
2754,"Best dogs ever! Keep in mind it is cash only. My wife and I didn't realize this until it was time to pay, and Doug ( nicest man ever that takes your order) let us eat, and then run to the ATM to pay. Sweet as apple pie. I had the corn dog and the gator, and my wife tried the blue cheese and pear sausage as well as the foie gras ( you have to try, right??!!!!) They were all delicious. A friend told us you can even bring you own beer, which was well needed to digest. The line wasn't too bad as other complained. My wife and I scarfed everything down! I recommend you try at least two dogs a person!"
2755,"This place is delicious! The line is a bit long to have to wait in, but it is well worth it! Check it out...."
2756,Does anything else need to be written about this place? Its the shit. And Doug always has awesome glasses on. When you show up and their is a line WAIT. The line is worth it all 3 hr's of that line are worth it.
2757,Love your hot dogs Doug.Thanks for the great food and friendly service.
2758,Great bibimbop.
2759,I love hot dougs. I love hot dougs. I love hot dougs. I love hot dougs. I love hot dougs. There are my five stars in five short sentences. This place is brilliant!
2760,I am not a fan of waiting for anything for more than an hour and a half.This place has proven me wrong time and time again. Thank you Hot Doug's for remaining gigantic part of my life. Stop what you are doing and go to Hot Doug's right now.
2761,"loved it and will always love it!!i can make my own bowl tastier so i dont get that BUT their wings are SO GOOD!! although sometimes, meat can get dried. i give it a four because it tasted good but i think it could've done better. esp with the bowls. overall, i was amazed ."
2762,"Really!?!? Best chicken in America by Yahoo? I mean, it was pretty good, but I guess a little overrated if you're saying BEST fried chicken. I tried the Seoul Sassy as well as the original. Their wings are HUGE which I liked, but my friend didn't. Smaller = juicier wings?? I don't agree. Anyway wings by themselves are definitely a 4 star rating. However, their Buddha bowl leaves a little to be desired. I know its a fusion type restaurant, but I suppose I'm just used to the kind in the stone bowls served hot with the rice all crispy on the edges! Also the service was meh. Overall, 3 star rating. If you like wings, go thy them here. They're good, but don't expect to be wowwwwed."
2763,"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was almost scared to make reservations too far in advance, so I started calling 2 weeks prior. Got a reservation without a problem, showed up, ate, and the food was awesome! No one called me to cancel, and the evening was great. I do have to say, though, that the whole cancelling last minute thing is very disturbing. You would think that a place this pricey would keep their customers happier... the anxiety alone from reading those sort of reviews is enough to make me say I probably won't go back. It's good to have tried it though!"
2764,"Best place ever to get a dog! I went with three friends and we ordered about 8-10 sausages. They were all great. I liked some better than the other, like the linguia with saffron and manchego. We also, went for the duck and foie sausage because you have to! The corn dog melted in my mouth. I don't even like corn dogs- i think i am hooked for life, and only for $1.50. The line wasn't to bad- right to the edge of the door. The line moves quickly, and its well worth it."
2765,"My beau and I had dinner at Schwa on Friday, July 1st and to say we were blown away would be an understatement. I am fairly traditional in my food experiences/preferences. Schwa pushed my comfort level, taste pallette, and food sophistication to the nth degree. It was beyond compare. The young men serving drinks, setting silver and serving and explaining our dishes were wonderful. They were humorous and well spoken when explaining each dish as they served it. We couldn't agree on our favorite food but the schmore dish, the rabbit and the crab dish were amazing. Thank you so much Chef Carlson and staff, for such a wonderful evening."
2766,"I went to Crisp the first day they opened way back when and went again a couple of weeks ago. It's not authentic Korean per se, it's really more American with Korean influence or very Americanized Korean food. On my recent visit, the fried chicken was good, but very greasy, memorably greasy as compared to the food on my first visit. It's a clean, small place with picnic tables and decent food, but nothing totally spectacular. I think they were more attentive to detail and customer service when they first opened, with personalized attention from the owner regarding food quality at that time."
2767,"For a hot dog joint, it's amazing. I had the Tueten and it's soooo GOOD...then again I love corned beef and to make a hot dog out of it was a great idea. The place opens at 1030 and when I arrived at 1015, there was already a line about 40 people deep. I think we ended up waiting in line 35 minutes before we got to the front (counting the 15 minute wait for the place to open). I think the food's great and really hits the spot if you're looking for a hot dog, but I still don't understand the extremely long lines, even in cold temperatures. I think being aired on the Food Network has a lot to do with it. So get there early. I tried to go once before (around 2 pm) and there had to be 100 people in line. The most important tip: ORDER THE DUCK FAT FRIES...they are only available Fridays and Saturdays."
2768,"Edit #2: They canceled our redo dinner 2 hours before. We did not reschedule.----------------------------------------------------------Edit #1: The restaurant staff did call me the next week to apologize for our experience. They offered to have us back to the restaurant to try again...which I thought was was very nice. Will update review after the second experience._________________________________________________________We went to schwa last night and had *hands down* the worst dining experience we have ever had in Chicago. I can overlook the fact that they cancelled our Thursday reservation 2 hours before dinner. At least they rescheduled us for the next day...annoying, but tolerable.The restaurant has a reputation for a laid back, laisseze faire attitude when it comes to service. Wonderful. However, last night, Carlson and his servers were not just obviously high and intoxicated. They were past the point of functioning. The chef alternated between making out with multiple women in the kitchen and sleeping on the prep table. His helpers were in no better shape. We went 2 hours without wine or water. They skipped a course - the main meat course - then denied they skipped it. Multiple patrons walked into the kitchen trying to obtain service and drinks. Overall, we were there 5 1/2 hours and left hungry and sober. They even had the absolute gall to charge us full price for a dinner experience that was beyond painful. We should have left without paying the check. I hope they use the money towards a stay in rehab...The best part of the evening? Carlson and one of his minions getting in a fist fight in the kitchen. Why? Because diners dared to complain about dinner. I think it is time for schwa to close its doors again."
2769,"I've only had the wings, which were very good. I mean these are the best wings I have ever eaten. But there were a lot of cons....1) Parking is hard to find2) It's pretty expensive. The chicken is superior to brands like KFC and Popeyes, but in terms of price and quality combined, I will go for the competitors.3) On a very busy night expect to wait a long time. This is a small complaint, but at least there's other stores around so you can walk around while you wait.4) This is my biggest complaint. The guy behind the counter has an attitude problem. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but if I had to try to explain it, it's like OK your done, get the f out of here now. Who's next? Given all these cons, I won't mind going back, since the chicken was good, but I won't go on a regular basis."
2770,I wanted to get a table here but how....? No one answers the phone. Who runs a restaurant / SERVICE business this way. I say go elsewhere. Someone please call the folks at James Beard to let them know about this ridiculousness's - how did they get a reservation and who bribed them.
2771,"Not only was the chicken crisp, but so was the attitude I got from the guy behind the counter. My husband and I arrived a little after 8:30 and despite the fact that there was a sign indicating that the dining room closed at 9:30, it was made pretty clear that we were not welcome to stay and eat. We found a bench a few yards away, outside, to enjoy our meal. Unfortunately, more disappointment ensued, due to the fact that the chicken just didn't live up to the hype. Poor service and lackluster flavor sum up my review."
2772,Damn good chicken.
2773,"Sassy is sooooooooooo sassy; the best creation every. Healthy food, delicious chicken, resonable $, unbeatable. One problem: they don't deliver to North Carolina boo-hooo."
2774,"I was ready to write a scathing review, to cover as descriptively as I am capable how disgusting and insulting was the evening I spent at Schwa recently. However, before I wrote it, I read Michael Carlson's Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/.Please read it before going. It will open your eyes to the 'scoop' and will most likely encourage you to go and experience the greatness of his culinary arts.Schwa is not just another restaurant in the Chicago 'fine dining' category. It isn't Alinea, Tru, Everest, Spaggia. It is none of these. In order to enjoy it, you must walk on the burning coals of loud and unappetizing rap/hip hop music several decibels too loud to hear the person next to you. You must not ask too many questions and enjoy being served by young 'disrespectful' staff (not all of them by any means) who reek of marijuana (absolutely nothing wrong with that in my book. I love the aroma).The reason we had a terrible time there is that we didn't understand the rules. We thought it was a typical establishment in the U.S. that considers service and the creating of an exquisite dining experience to be equal to the food one is served. Schwa only focuses on the food. They do not care about catering to or kow-towing to the rich elite who want to be waited on hand and foot and be pampered by obsequious waiters. When you read the wikipedia entry, you'll understand why.Chef Carlson, while his capacity to run a successful business may be compromised by the excruciating mental anguish he's been through, is trying to remain pure to his vision. He wants to create incredible culinary delights and is doing so. In addition, his staff is very loyal to him. He obviously is an outstanding mentor for these budding chefs. I fully expect to see them start their own restaurants over the next several years.Bottom line: you will immensely enjoy the experience if you understand what Chef Carlson has been through; if you do not expect it to be polished like Trotter's or Tru and if you are going there to experience the food creations rather than the ambiance. I strongly recommend encouraging Chef Carlson's vision by continuing to mention Schwa and going there. There is true greatness in the kitchen if not in the dining area."
2775,"I'm a Korean living in Lakeview and, trust me, there is no such thing as authentic Korean food here. You're better off making your way up to Lawrence Ave. or even the 'burbs.The bi bim bop at Crisp is mediocre at best with an unappetizing, runny, watery soup that collects at the bottom of the bowl after mixing everything. I can only guess that this comes from the washed veggies that aren't shaken free of excess water. Sesame oil is a key ingredient in this dish so, upon ordering, I made sure that it was included. I also wanted to get an impression of how far this place diverged from the traditional. They told me that the veggies are lightly seasoned with sesame oil before they're placed in the bowl. Lightly seems to be the key word here since I didn't taste any sesame oil at all. Sloppy & lazy. Also, for some of the clueless Yelpers, bi bim bop is SUPPOSED to include sides of hot pepper paste so quit making it sound like it was an extra, complimentary bonus of some kind.Their kimchi is overpriced but good. I like that they offer both radish & cabbage kinds although it wouldn't surprise me if they bought their kimchi from a supermarket.I didn't even bother with the bulgogi since it's pretty gross when it's badly made.But their Seoul Sassy wings are ok. Not nearly as spicy as my Korean palate would prefer but still pretty decent and understandably toned down for the demographics of this neighborhood. If you want huge wings and you're sick of buffalo, bbq and teriyaki, this is the place to go."
2776,"Complete A$$Holes...Litterally the worst customer service of any place in Chicago. They called and claimed they had a big SEWER LEAK and they had to cancel my reservation. THIS WAS 2 HRS before we were supposed to arrive. They said the place was closed for the night. The guy on the phone, SETH, claimed to be the manager when I asked to speak with one. What MANAGER takes reservation calls? To add insult to injury, they were NOT closed as he claimed, we went there and the place was packed. SHWA? GO F yourself."
2777,Unbelieve food and experience... This blog pretty much sums it up....http://forksandcorkschicago.com/2011/01/14/schwa-chicagos-tiny-piece-of-culinary-heaven/... if you can get yourself a reservation...go!
2778,5 stars if i didn't have to wait an hour for a hot dog!! wow this place is a full house every time i come! cool place if your looking for good fast food!! hope they open a second location
2779,Crisp has delicious food at fantastic prices. What more could you want?The Buddha Bowls are my favorite but the fried chicken is delicious as are the wraps. This is a great place for really good cheap eats!
2780,Best Hot Dog I have ever had = Alligator Hot Dog!!
2781,The greatest meal I've ever eaten in my entire life. A spiritual experience in the truest sense of the word--Michael Carlson is a madman genius.
2782,"the food here is great and very tasty. However, the prices are very high and I just found out they raised them even more. I mean it's just rice and veggies... $10.25 for a Budda Bowl with brown rice is a little steep."
2783,"Go to Schwa if you can. It was my 18th birthday dinner, and this meal kicked the ass of my dad's 60th birthday at L20 a year ago. The service was great, the food was amazing, and the entire experience was laid back in a way no other fine dining experience would be. We ordered the 9 course meal, but ended up with 12 dishes (possibly thanks to a bottle of wine gifted to the kitchen crew). Highlights included a fig and scallop dish, the infamous quail egg ravioli, a smore with campfire smoke, and the perfectly cooked octopus with pineapple. As the night ended I made a trip through the kitchen to the bathroom. On my way Chef Carlson asked how the meal was. I said it then, i'll say it again, it was amazing. Thank you Schwa and Chef Carlson, you deserved at least 2 stars, if not 3."
2784,"My favorite place to grab a bite in the neighborhood. Usually my boyfriend and I go and get 1 order of Seoul Sassy wings and 1 Seoul Sensation burrito to share both and sometimes we still have leftovers. The first time I had Seoul Sassy wings spoiled me for life--I will never love any chicken dish as much as I love that. I love my fried chicken, but that takes it to a whole new level. YUM!!! The burrito is bursting with the freshest ingredients. If I go alone, I can eat half the burrito and have the next half the next day--lot of bang for your buck. Good prices, friendly service, clean place, best food--can't go wrong."
2785,"My boyfriend and several of our friends were lucky enough to get a reservation here last minute. We brought the chefs a 12 pack of specialty crafted brew, and they loved it!. I highly recommend bringing a small gift of some sort of achohol. It will go along way. I can't really say anything that hasn't been before about this place, but I loved it. I am a huge foodie and have eaten at practically every hot spot in Chicago and this place is truly different. When we went there the head chef ended up sitting at our table and had drinks with us and talked with us about all sorts of culinary delights for almost the whole dinner. The presentation and execution of the food was magnificent, however some plates weren't to my liking. I can be very picky with whats in my food, so it was probably just my own taste for what I like not the chefs preparation. However if you don't like a dish feel free to tell your chef. No joke! They actually like corrective criticism and will not take any offense at all. If you are looking for a quite romantic dinner this is not the place. If you are looking for one of the truly most unique dinning experiences then you have to try Schwa!P.S. Dont forget the Chef's gift of a spirit of your choice."
2786,Best Hot dogs in Chicago hands down.Fries cooked in duck fat only on Friday and Saturday. ( Awesome) The foei gras dog... out of this world....The dogs were very tasty.Loved the small cozy restaurant.....
2787,"My first review YAY!!!! I'm finally breaking down and writing reviews instead of just using review hehe.This place is right down the street from my apt so my roomie and I went there last night. She had this crazy bowl with an egg on top, I forget the name, and I had a sandwich that was pretty decent. The flavors were different than what I'm used to, but I'm not that adventurous. Hoping to change that now that I'm in Chicago!The employees there were really nice and the communal seating at the long benches was pretty cool. We'll definitely be comng back here."
2788,Amazing. Simply amazing.
2789,I love this place...
2790,Some of the best bbq chicken I have ever had ! I went there on their opening weekend and have been back many times . They have stayed consistently delicious and anyone I have recommended it to has loved it.
2791,"Okay, this place has so many five star reviews it doesn't really need mine, but I can't resist. I have been to Schwa three times now, and although there has been a little repetition in the menu, I have never minded because their dishes are nearly all out-of-this-world. I highly recommend the nine course option -- yes, it's $110 per person for the food -- but you can bring your own wine, and there's no better spot in the city to splurge on a special occasion with your significant other or a small group of good friends. Unlike other high-end Chicago spots where the outsized staff hovers over you to the point of annoyance, Schwa is relaxed and fun, and you are actually served by the chefs themselves. And yes, the food is better (in my opinion) than Alinea, Tru and the rest. Enjoy this little Chicago gem!!"
2792,"Absolute deliciousness! I'm half Korean and grew up with Korean food. However, my mom sure didn't make fried chicken this good. I was so excited when Crisp opened a few years back. It has definitely become my go-to place when I'm craving some spicy bi bim bop and am too lazy to make it myself. When my brother visits from Michigan, stopping for lunch is de rigeur. We split a half chicken with Seoul Sassy sauce and a baby buddha bowl. Allison's Atomic sauce and the mushrooms are quite good too."
2793,I went in here with a buddy of mine that is in the US Army (uniformed on this occasion). Doug wouldn't accept any more than $5 for a $20 meal. Doug is a class act. The food..... unbelievably good! One of Chicago's best experiences.
2794,"Very rarely am I speechless, but all there is to say is:The best meal I have ever had, period."
2795,"I like the regular dogs, my brother loves the more exoctic dougs.Gotta try it at least once!"
2796,The korean style chicken was sooooo goood! also the staff was nice and they played great music!
2797,"I ate at Schwa when it first opened, once after he re-opened the restaurant after Chef Carlson's sudden close of Schwa and recently during last thanksgiving week. In summary, I think it has gone down severely in terms of food and service. When it first opened it I thought it was some of the most innovative food with flavors and preparation that were nothing short of mind-blowing good. It reminded me of Mugaritz with its bold and intelligent flavors and food combinations.After Carlson shut down and re-opened, I had another fantastic meal which was actually better than our meal at Alinea which we ate at the following evening. I have eaten at Alinea at least a half-dozen times and always thought Carlson was or could be in the same league as Grant in terms of sheer cooking talent and his deep understanding of flavors. In addition, the small atmosphere and unconventional setting at Schwa was always more to my liking than a 'big statement' restaurant.However, my last experience dining at Schwa was awful. The food preparation and presentation was sloppy at best and most of the dishes simply did not work compared to our past dining experiences. Although there was some interesting ideas, most of the dishes were clearly not refined yet and there were large inconsistencies on the same dish between each of the 4 diners at our table.The service was beyond awful. When we asked if one of the ingredients in one of dishes of the 9 course tasting menu could be substituted because someone in our party was allergic to it, our server laughed in our face and rudely say 'no fucking way'. That sort of set our expectations for the rest of the evening. It then became quite apparent that our server, a rather larger person, BO was overpowering the food. In addition, he rarely told us what each dish was and if we dared to ask, he seemed annoyed. Although Chef Carlson did greet me when we first walked in, he was busy serving other 'local' diners who were obviously getting extra dishes and much more personal service.The quirkiness of Schwa is one of the things I did love about the restaurant and although consistency was never a term that you would attribute to Carlson, I think the restaurant has gone down in terms of service and especially the food and we will unfortunately have to skip it for a while until I hear if things have improved. The good news is that there are quite a few other great places to dine when visiting the Chicago area."
2798,"I really enjoyed my Bi Bim Bop! I'll be back at Crisp, for sure!"
2799,"I'm normally not that into food preparation and all that jazz, but this impressed me its almost worth all the reservations pains. They've got some really weird dishes, but well executed, you'd think there was these dishes made up from long ago. Well made, weird dishes is what I can say. Quail Egg Ravioli = win."
2800,"I've been to Hot Doug's on several occasions and it never fails to deliver what it promises....IN-CASED MEATS!!!! They have so many different varieties of sausages it's hard to choose. And by the time you've made it through the line you are so f'ing hungry that you might end up ordering one of everything. I've had nearly everything on the permanent menu and I can say it would be hard to go wrong with anything you choose.I know many rave about the duck fat fries. I'm not a big fan, I think they are severely overrated. So if you have a few hours to kill (1.5 hours waiting in line) make a trip to emporium."
2801,"This place is good, but we've always had to wait. Overall, I would say, it's not the best dinner option in the area. If you're just looking for something a little more casual and just as tasty, I'd recommend Picante, Lou Malnatis and Smoke Daddy. They're not as expensive, but just as good."
2802,"Holy, this place is good. My girl and I first wandered in here last week and we've been twice since then. Thankfully my gym is open 24 hours a day because Hot Dougs aint exactly healthy. However, as soon as you bite into one of those dogs...man, its like heaven.Go on friday for duck fat fries."
2803,"Great dogs, what moe can a fella say? If you don't want to wait, go somewhere else dumb dumb."
2804,"Crisp is fantastic but one word of warning, CASH ONLY. I can't believe how much they give you for the cost. If i had to choose a string of words to describe it I would say quasi-hipster-seoul-food. They have Bimmibop and fried chicken (huge btw), awesome fries, steak bowls and crazy items like korean burritos. It's great food and it's on the cheap, a great spot to swing by. The benches aren't real comfortable and food preparation takes awhile, i recommend ordering ahead"
2805,"This place is great! I don't make it here often because its not near any public transportation and usually has a long line but every time I do I remember that its worth it. I can't believe top chef didn't come here, and that they did a hot dog challenge in NYC, wtf."
2806,"Finally made it in to Schwa, on somebody ELSE's reservation as I refuse to try any more. This was after having dined recently at Alinea, Manresa, some other amazing places. My response: yes creative and dramatic, but without complexity, cohesiveness or focus. It felt like they were trying so hard to make the food unusual that no one taste was really amazing, and nothing made sense with what came before it. Anybody who compares this place to Alinea needs to go back, as it is nowhere near the same level, or at least admit that they are largely responding to the difference in price. And as goes without saying, my vist was marked by plenty of attitude from the staff. If this were really the casual neighborhood place they are pretending to be, I might give a better review, but compared to the work of really great chefs, I'll take a pass."
2807,"This place is dope. Period.The wings are F'ing awesome, and their bowls are really good too. Can't wait to try more of their stuff."
2808,"I have never had anything like this food (which is too generic a word) and I loved every bite.I am not edgy or cool and this place is very edgy and cool and yet I was completely at ease and comfortable. The music is not my taste and I didn't know any of the artists, but the thing I liked about it was it created privacy in a small space. My conversation was heard by the person who was intended to hear it. It also complemented the energy of the kitchen. And maybe the intended effect was to even out any energy differential between the kitchen and the dining room. I thought it did and it was fun.This place also reminded me of really talented people who decide to do a stint in the public sector to hone skills and act upon some principal of their personality. If I had to guess at the principal at work with the owner I would say accessibility (to uncommon flavors and concepts). I bet it's not as expensive as restaurants serving similar fare too. Yes, I needed to reschedule my original reservation, but they were persistent and courteous about the process. I once knew someone who at a certain time in his life went to fancy restaurants for an ego boost. Sometimes he would be disappointed at some of the City's better known restaurants if they did not provide the right service. I do not think the quirks of this place would have appealed to him. I could not have had a better time!"
2809,"This place is AMAZING. Wings are freshly fried when you order them, and they're not like those puny wings that you find at other so-called wing places like Yak-zies or even BW3 (which I still do love). These wings are Texas-sized wings that come in different sauces. Try the Korean BBQ or the Seoul Sassy. Best wings in Chicago, period.Jon, the manager, is also awesome - makes you feel welcome and always asks how everything was and what he could do to make the experience better. And he knows his stuff - we got to talking, and he told me about the different types of ways to marinate chicken, how to keep wings fresh and crispy, how they make their own sauce, etc. Go now and have the best wings, then thank me later :)"
2810,"As I entered, I was greeted promptly by the chef! We were sat went for the larger menu, and everything was perfect! It is great to bring your own wine, and the chef was even so kind to pour us something to match a course! For me, that is really going above and beyond. It truly is an experience not to be missed. The food was seasoned perfectly. I didn't mind the phone tag as the restaurant seats only about 20. It is important to realize that there are about 4-6 people running the show. It is important to be flexible with the chef, and they will take care of you hands down.My new favorite restaurant in Chicago!"
2811,"I'm glad this Korean restaurant is in my neighborhood. Great Pi Bim Bap , i mean, Buddha Bowls. Great kimchi. I just wish Crisp had more variety of Korean foods like Kim Bap, Kim Ji Jigae, jap chae, chewy potato pizzas, mandu, Dwang Jung Jigae -- use the stone pots for real authenticity, guys! And I'd give my pinky finger for Naengmyeon! (you can skip the bondeggi, i insist. lol)Trust me, Chicago is ready for originality.Nice, clean place, affordable -- the same prices as in South Korea.Thanks for showing some variety to Americans! XD"
2812,"Perfection.I tell you, one of the major perks of living in Lakeview (besides the clean atmosphere, pedestrian friendly streets, beautiful architecture on the buildings, and the...lake) is the plethora of great eateries we have within walking distance.Crisp definitely fits in here. Their sweet and slightly spicy wings (which are uncut, full winged monsters) are definitely worth trying. They are what got me hooked on this place.My favorites are the Buddha bowls: delightful combinations of spinach, rice, beansprouts, carrots, and other vegetables. Meat if you want it. Oh... and I mustn't forget about the lovely fried egg they put on top!!! The regular-sized bowls are large enough for two people to share!It's hearty enough for vegetarians!The atmosphere of the place is nice, too. The fellows who work there are always laid back and easy going. Genuinely nice guys. They have these large, Medieval-looking tables which can be shared with more than one group of people (thus discouraging the isolation that has become so prevalent in our society ;P) The place is always clean. I've never seen a dirty table or bathroom or anything. All in all... you gotta try this place. It's very casual, affordable. Definitely even worth making a trip for!"
2813,Culinary mastery and taste bud bliss. The atmosphere is funky and relaxed; the people are encouraging and fun. Well worth the wait. For sure.
2814,Great wings only second to Wings Around the World..these are phenominal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Either or for me..but if im going south im going to Wings around the World...BEST EVER...recognize..crisp you got youre own thing going as well..keep up the good chicken...
2815,"What can I say - it was an incredible experience.Michael called me 1 month after I left him a message on his voice mail. He was apologetic and was able to accommodate my party of 6 on a Friday night. Which is a big deal for this small space. The decor is not much to write home at but frankly that is not why you go to Schwa. Michael and his crew are truly artists with food as their medium. We ordered the 9 course tasting menu and got more like 12 courses. The presentation was amazing and flavors haunting. Some complain about the music but we loved it and honestly it helped make the atmosphere nice and casual. Bottom line is this: To get a meal like this anywhere in the world(I say this because I just returned from Europe) you would pay three times as much and have to put up with a stuffy atmosphere. Michael and Schwa offer a unique experience - seeing an artist in his element, making masterpiece after masterpiece."
2816,"We went there a while ago. First impression walking in was, really? Is this all? But still, we were down for anything as long as the food was fantastic. The waiter (a guy from the kitchen) was perfectly nice. Foodies as we are, we were ready to eat! After all, we had an impossible- borderline annoying- time getting a reservation. Anyways, the food was only OK. We've had much better around the city of Chicago for comparable prices, and those dinners all came with a better ambiance. But the real problem was that both my husband and I got brutal food poisoning from our dinners. I mean, the worst we've ever had, ever. I actually called them early the next day, and I was very nice on the phone- especially given the fact that I was up all night throwing up our our $250+ meal. I told them we ate there the night before and had something that unfortunately gave us both bad food poisoning and that they might want to check on what it was (it's usually a sauce) to avoid getting others ill. The jerk could not have been more rude, he actually questioned whether we really had food-poisoning and never even apologized- he just said alright and hung up! Infuriating. I hope no one else became sick, and I hope no one does in the future, but looking at that cramped dirty little kitchen I doubt that's possible.Bottom line, won't be back, good luck to those who dare to dine!"
2817,"I love this place! Awesome wings, delicious Bi Bim Bap, and reasonable priced. They have these cool large picnic tables where you can sit instead, and plenty of hand wipes for those wings! Yummy!"
2818,Amazing food and service. Surprising flavor combinations. Interaction with the chefs. Great atmosphere.
2819,"I know some people reserve 5 stars for fancy restaurants, but I must say this place is awesome for a finger licking Friday night. Some might argue about the most delicious sauce...I am true to the Seoul Sassy, but my boyfriend is obsessed with the BBQ....either way - it will become an addiction. Try it for a concert in the park or Ravinia - they have a whole chicken meal for like $20. It's delicious - you will not be disappointed. At worst you will regret reading this review because it will lead to a new addiction. We knew it was bad when we had worked out for 2 hours one night and still ended up with a whole fried chicken..."
2820,This is spectacular food and very fun ambiance. Not only do they play interesting newer music including underground hip hop but the staff is great. The chef's brought out each and every dish to us and explained each dish thoroughly. My girl and I even grabbed a drink with them when they closed at a nearby watering hole.
2821,"I tried Crisp after reading all the great reviews it recieved. I ordered the Chicken wings in Seoul Sassy, plain and spicy I also ordered the buddah bowl. I didn't like the buddah bowl at all. I thought the chicken was well seasoned and had great flavor, but that it was to dry. I have tried the place twice and both times the chicken was dry, so this is not a place I will go out of my way to go back to. I will say the guy behind the counter was fabulous....very friendly"
2822,"Get there after lunch hours to avoid the long line. It does move along pretty quickly though and once inside you get your food FAST. Awesome place. Fredhots is another awesome place for hot dogs if you're in the Glenview area. Hey Doug, if you and Fred put on boxing gloves, who would win? :D"
2823,"Shockingly, stunningly good. Each course was refreshingly unique, and exceedingly successful. I'm one-hundred-percent positive that I want to eat Jellyfish pad thai for the rest of my lunches from now until eternity. My girlfriend and I went to celebrate her birthday and my recent move to Chicago. I work in the restaurant business and we go out quite often. Because of that we both are averse to putting out fellow restaurant workers, and so try to be as low maintenance as possible. That being said, we have food restrictions (i.e. allergies, vegetarianism) though we try to get dishes already on menus rather than trying to get special meals. We didn't have to worry about that at Schwa. Executive-chef Michael Carlson personally tailored a 10 course meal for each of us. Mostly it was just subtle changes in the current menu, but I didn't even ask (I figured that we would just have half the courses and that would be that) and he just created a couple new dishes for us. I brought a paired beer, wine, and spirit for each course as Michael gave me a menu 2 weeks before we dined. The staff was exceedingly friendly throughout the entire experience and I have mountains of good things to say about Schwa (and not a single negative comment) which I will mishmash-paraphrase: Musicriffic, drunkenilicious, not just bang but Ka-boom for your buck, meal. That aside, I know that a number of my friends, as well as a couple of reviewers, have been down in the doldrums because of the difficulty of getting a reservation, so I will give you, the reader, the same piece of advice that I gave my friends: You can certainly sit on your couch and call occasionally to try and get a reservation at a place that only has 5 employees who spend the entire day prepping amazing meals (and don't have much time to answer phones), or you can walk your lazy asses down to Schwa and talk to them in person. They are extremely accepting of people walking in between 3-4pm and you can usually get a reservation for sometime in the following 2 weeks. It's worth it. It's worth every imagined inconvenience and every penny spent."
2824,"I should share this personal detail first.... Recovering vegetarian here. Doug helped me cross back over to the land of encased meats. The line vs. the fabulous dogs? I am lucky enough to live in the general area and don't have to treat Doug's as a destination restaurant. But the line is a bit overwhelming on the weekends (Friday and Saturday at hot doug's). and the weekend is the only time you can get the fabulous duck fat fries.Everything I have ever tried has been fabulous. I am particularly fond of the Portuguese linguica and Catalonian pork sausage with their particular toppings. (saffron aioli, aged manchego, etc.) Perfect combinations of flavors that you won't find anywhere else. Don't forget cash only. (I have seen one couple wait in a long line to get to inside and see the cash only sign; by the time we finished our dogs, they were again at the front of the line.... persevere, my friends) Enjoy."
2825,I'm not going to bore anyone with yet another review of this place. I think its pretty much established that it ROCKS. Three words: duck fat fries.
2826,wow. best meal of my life. absolutely amazing dinner and wonderful chefs. the chefs present each wonderfully creative dish to you at your table. some of the most imaginative dishes i have ever eaten in a small and intimate space - i couldn't wait for each course and felt lucky to be there.
2827,"Went to Schwa for a birthday dinner. I had no problems getting a reservation -- two DAYs before we ate. It can be done, you just have to flexible. I left a message on their voice mail saying I'd like a reservation for any day that week should they have a cancellation. They called back a day later with two different days for me to choose. Logically it makes sense, most people make these reservations so far in advance, when the time comes they can't make it.The food is fantastic. It's great to watch the kitchen in action. BYOB really helps on the price."
2828,"I allow myself this bit of heaven every once in awhile. All I can say is heaven on a bun. Every single fantastic creation my lips have ever tasted have been memorable to say the least. There is a reason for all the great reviews. Get your butt over to HD's, just be ready to wait in that line. Worth it!!"
2829,"If you are in Lakeview andwant a quick bite to eat, I recommend the Foodie's Choice Crisp, the best chicken sandwich I've ever had."
2830,Fantastic food in a cozy environment. The chef was very nice and it was great to get to talk to him during the meal.
2831,"Loved it.Loved, loved, loved it.Went here for the first time after the boyfriend and I got into a screaming fight and decided to make up over hot dogs and cheese fries. Got there around 11:30, waited maybe 10 minutes and was treated with a delicious, delicious chicken and cranberry sausage, coated in honey with thick chunks of creamy, salty cheese. Needless to say, the relationship has lasted more than the day, and my Hot Doug's experience has been cemented in my mind as a top 10 experience. If you're in the city, just go. You're welcome in advance."
2832,"I went to Hot Doug's for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing! I didn't even get one of the exotic dogs, I got a regular steamed hot dog with mustard, relish, and onions. It was delicious! I also had the cheese fries, YUM! I tried the Duck fat fries too, which were also tasty.It is so cool that they have different kinds of sausages every day. Even though there is a giant line every day, it is totally worth it!"
2833,"This place is really good. I tried the fried chicken which was crisp on the outside and juicy throughout. I had one of the many rice bowls they offer and it was delicious and fresh. If you don't know what to order, the owners are really nice and helpful, so you can't go wrong. Trust me, this place is great!"
2834,The Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Goose Island Honker's Ale Mustard and Serendipity Cheese is fantastic!
2835,"http://en.wikipedia.org/Coming from NYC, I have been fortunate enough to experience a large variety of Bi Bim Bop. Not all fare is to everyone's liking which makes Crisp such an awesome spot to eat at. Their menu offers an offbeat approach to not only Korean food but also a hint of good old American eats. My favorite KFC(Korean fried chicken) is the Seoul Sassy glazed whole bird. My wife and I always get a buddha bowl to accompany the yummy chicken. The mild flavors of the cold marinated vegatables mixes perfectly with the steamy hot rice. Make sure you mix in the buddha sauce before you dig in(makes it ohh soo scrumptious). Non-KFC eaters should try out the Seoul Sensation burrito which has the Bulgogi beef and Allison's Atomic sauce on the side. The sweet beef with the fresh veggies and the spicy cream sauce makes for a stupendous lunch. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try new food venues."
2836,"Love, love, love it. Gotta go when in Chi-town"
2837,"I liked this place alot because of the food, I specially like the seoul sassy chix, seoul sensation & baby buddha.. the only thing i don't like about this place is the parking, it took us a little more than half an hour to look for a spot! other than that the place is recommendable!"
2838,"I am always looking for the perfect dog, well I have stopped looking. Hot Doug's is the mecca. I have tried most of their gourmet dogs which is hard since they change so often. Everything is great my only complaint is the long lines almost all the time."
2839,Two words: Steak bowl. Go get yourself one NOW!
2840,"I've had the beef burrito which was good. Nothing amazing. However, the wings were spectacular!! The sweet korean bbq sauce was dynamite. And we're not talking about 3 inch sized wings, these were big honkers! Go for the wings and you'll be quite pleased."
2841,"The food here is really good, I could not believe the size of the wings. I got the Big Budda Bowl with beef and left feeling full. I wish they were open seven days and later. I can't wait to try everything else. They need to deliver, in case people are to lazy to walk over there."
2842,"Staggering home from a night of drinking with the east side frenz, I practically lick the window of crisp.Closed? At 11?The worst thing about Crisp is that it isn't open at those times you need it the most. WHo can resist the fried chicken (I take mine spicy, spicy, spicy), especially when you have a belly full of booze needing to be sopped up?"
2843,Warning: The Wings are INSANE! They will inspire midnight cravings. 4 Stars because their 'sides' need some work.
2844,"Problems in paradise???I know one of the owners (I went to high school with him) and I was very excited to be able to try Crisp and catch up. I have to say my order of the Crisp BBQ was just okay, but my friend's Seoul Sassy wings were fantastic...I also cannot say enough about the onion rings. However, I was disappointed to find out that there seems to some tension at Crisp. I asked for my old friend and and was told that he just decided not to show one day and that was two weeks ago. Of course people change in twenty years, but this was not the person I knew back in high school. Oh well. I hope they reconcile whatever differences they have and open a Crisp in Schaumburg. Then I could enjoy the Seoul Sassy chicken on a regular basis....as well as the O-rings."
2845,"The food is great here! Delicious! I've gone several times and being Korean I was somewhat skeptical about the You So Crazy Korean Burrito but I have to say that the Seoul Sensation is exactly that...sensational! The chicken of course, especially the Wacky Wacky Wings, are awesome too. The BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces are my favorite. I've told many friends to try it and they have all liked it as well. The owners were very friendly and helpful explaining the menus and they seem very invested in making sure that you will enjoy your meal there. Definitely will be returning to try out some of their other menu items. You have to go!"
2846,"Crisp is the Shit.Great food, awesome service, great food, awesomeness.I love Crisp. Everyone should go."
2847,"Today I came in and met Doug, who I presume to be an owner or at least a half-owner. I start my review by saying this because I think it's significant; your first impression of Crisp will be that it's a trendy type of place but is run by a very down-to-earth owner. He will ask you for your name and then for your order.I came in for the chicken wings, which were delicious. They're fried and covered in several sauces. Out of the sauces I had, the Seoul Sassy was tasty and on the milder side, while the Crisp BBQ was a lot spicier and bolder. The latter had much of the same spicy flavor you would find in kimchi (without the fermented taste, of course), but also had a sweet component like a BBQ sauce. I may have liked them a bit spicier, even, to balance out the sweet, but I think fans of BBQ wings will like these a lot. My fries were a little soggy by the time they got to my place, but that's just what happens to fried foods in transit. All in all, really great wings with inventive sauces. You can have a half or whole chicken done this way too.I think what Crisp has done well is pander to the crowd without losing its roots. The food is definitely Am-Asian, but the flavors which are put into their burritos and wings are those which are very reminiscnet of a typical Korean meal (at least from what I've had of that cuisine.) You can even get a bibimbap bowl (there called a 'buddha bowl') with their own twist.The combo of trendy modern with down-to-earth people and of traditional Korean flavors with familiar American cuisine is why this restaurant is such a success. The food is unique and different, yet still comforting. If you're in the area, this is a place to check out, especially if you're tired of eating pre-frozen wings in soul-less sports bars."
2848,"I loveeee this place. Sometimes I come here and see a line not around the building, but around the block. The hot dogs are cheap and in the quintessential chicago style. Chicago's best hot dogs!!!"
2849,"Being from New York and having tried Bon Chon, UFC, Cheogajip, Kyochon chicken, it was a nice surprise to have found Crisp. I read their review on Time Out Chicago and had to check it out.We ordered one of the Buddha Bowls, Marty's Mushrooms, and 10 wings. Now realize that 10 wings at Crisp is 20 wings anywhere else at half the cost! We got the wings half sassy and half BBQ by recommendation of one of the owners, Doug. I was able to pick the veggies of my choice for the Buddha Bowl and got it with tofu. The veggies and seasoned perfectly.The chicken was OUTSTANDING. the outside was ridiculously crispy and the inside moist and juicy. They were not smothered in sauce like at Cheogajip. The sauces complimented the chicken really well. Thinking of the chicken right now 2 days later makes my mouth water for more. Did I mention that the chicken is made to order? HOT CHICKEN! mmmmm.The mushrooms were tasty as well. Doug let us sample 2 different sauces. My only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of mushrooms we had. The seating is communal...3 large tables with benches and then there are bar stools with a counter along the wall. Wet naps were supplied as were an unlimited roll of paper towels on the tabletops. I was told that they are working on a liquor license and sidewalk seating. That would be most awesome once summer comes around. What is better than cold beer and fried chicken on a summer day??? They are BYOB so if you can't wait for their license, bring your own (no corkage fee).As for the other items on the menu, I saw a lot of people order the whole chickens. The owners were very informative, patient and helpful to the customers ordering, like myself.I will surely be back for more."
2850,"I like you a lot, a real, real lot my little sausages. I would be a regular if it wasn't so outrageuosly business with only a limited window of opportunity to enter for lunch."
2851,"i am not sure what kyung was talking about. no chicken will compare to the standard from korea. NYC /LA is not the best either. not sure where she gets this information. ignorance is defintely a bliss, for closed mind folks. enjoy!! and im glad that crisp is finally in the lakeview area. travel to chicago for work from nyc and it's nice to stop by."
2852,"If you wanna put an encased piece of meat in your body, this is the place to start.Likes: There is an excellent selection of creative sausages that are priced fairly, and served quickly. The fries are good for what they are (the fresh cut variety often get greasier and it makes my aging stomach angry). Dislikes: There are several, hence the 3 stars. It is located in a pretty inconvenient spot for people sans cars, and the hours are so limited that there is always a long line to place your order. It's hard to imagine a well established business like Hot Doug's still only accepting cash. Many neighborhood places do it so that they can avoid city taxes (which are disproportionately high for small businesses), but this just seems like hard-headedness. If you have a couple of hours (like when people are in from out of town) Hot Dougs is worth the wait. Unfortunately, that condition rarely applies to me."
2853,"I just love this place. I love how everyone goes here, from the working class to the wicker park hipsters. I love the ever rotating sellection of sausage and I especially love the duck fat fries. I have never had a bad experience and doug is such a sweety!"
2854,"An actually ode to marketing rather than food. About 45-60 people an hour move at a glacial pace creating a line for -- a hot dog and fries? Hmmm, and I bet you all wouldn't even be talking about this place if they moved people faster and had let's say 5 people in line. The story is the line and if this place is so popular why don't they address the ridiculously slow pace. Years in the restaurant business has taught me that hype is king. Too bad I really wanted to like this place. Tourists and people taking pictures of themselves standing in line. What's next bread lines?"
2855,"For all the hype, this place failed to deliver. It is also misleading for this to be considered a hot dog place since the hot dog is marginal and they really seemed to be an exotic encased meat purveyor. Duck fat fries are not special and I really think that people think they are special because people have told them they should think they are special. I think the one time will be probably be the only time."
2856,I tried this place again and the fries are still super greasythe hot dog was sour tasting and not even hotthey are way over prcedthe service is rottenthe very very long line must be people that are trying it for the first time or giving it one more chance like I didthey cannot be regular customersunless they like wasting their time and moneyand enjoy cold greasy sour tasting food.
2857,What a selections of dogs and sausages!The only downside is the wait so you have to get there early.Comming back next week.
2858,"There's something very impressive about a guy who could whip up a four-course meal that would kick your ass, but who chooses to use his gifts for something he really, really loves.The atmosphere is kooky and a little old-school. You get the feeling he's got a lot of fans who probably send a lot of gifts, but for good reason - the food is incredible. Aside from having a pretty decent Chicago-style hot dog, it's the specialty menu that would keep me coming back time and time again. My very first specialty dog was a buffalo-ale and chipotle stuffed sausage with La Fin du Monde mustard and harvati cheese. It was epic. My tastebuds weren't prepared for the exquisite deliciousness that I forced upon them; they loved it. I've also had the pleasure of enjoying a bell pepper chicken sausage with pesto, fresh mozzarella and roma tomatoes (that mozzarella made my day) and a few others that have yet to disappoint me.Even with the great food, the nostalgic atmosphere and the generally awesome idea behind the place, nothing matches the friendliness of Doug himself. I won't take the time to explain - just go in, introduce yourself and understand. Then get ready for the best sausage-experience of your life..."
2859,"I check the specials on the web even when I'm out of town and have no way of getting there. I recommend getting the Game of the Week (even if it is an alligator sausage or rattlesnake or anything you've never heard of) and a second sausage. I also recommend getting the fries to split with your friends (even though they are outstanding, freshly made, and great when dipped in cheese).Be prepared to wait 45 minutes in line on a Saturday. Check the website if you plan to go - he closes, randomly, just because.If you don't like this place, I don't like you."
2860,"In the city where hot dogs are king (except for those who use ketchup), Hot Doug's is the Buckingham Palace. Not only can you enjoy the standard hot dog choices, but Doug has opened up a exciting world of exotic encased meats that delights all the senses. And the buns are always fresh. The only problem with Hot Doug's is that I moved 10 miles away from it."
2861,"anybody who doesn't like this place is simply not human, not normal and extremely ridiculous. this place is amazing. everything about it from the food to the staff. i've had religious experiences here. go asap. you're life depends upon it.doug is god."
2862,"I love Hot Doug's, but the wait is usually outrageous! They also close quite early... : ("
2863,I can't get enough. The varity. The laid back joint.I love the hot dogs here. If I have two things to pick about it is the long lines (but that just proves they are great!) and the way my stomach feels after my 4th hot dog in a row.
2864,"Oh my god, all this time and I haven't reviewed Hot Doug's! I guess everyone else has said all that's been said, I will just say that, most of the time, when you are going out to eat, you are getting your pocket picked. Not here. He keeps the prices reasonable, and if I weren't such a pig, I'd have a hard time spending ten bucks here, for the best lunch in town.I usually wind up with more than I need, because I always want to try a special dog, and I have to get a Chicago dog too. I do think Doug sometimes screws up some of the balance on a few of the special sausages, particularly, I don't think the flavored mustards work very well, usually. Being from South Louisiana, I tend to take two approaches to mustard: use it straight, or use it to flavor something, such as remoulade. I think when you try to flavor mustard with something like basil, it doesn't work so well. Better to use mustard on the sausage and add some fresh basil on top, I think. Just me.My Southern eccentricities aside, I have never left here disappointed. And, he's got great andouille. If you're ever there when he's got the gator sausage, get it."
2865,I would eat a homeless man before I would eat their duck fries again. THey smell like ass and you people seem to like that.
2866,"I've eaten plenty of hot dogs and fries in my day, but none have tasted as good as Doug's. And Doug is a sweetheart. I just wish you were open 24 hours."
2867,I could just repeat everything that has been said good about this place. You want a perfect hot dog experience? This is the Holy Grail. It's nice to see a place done well with a lot of thought and care.Check it out!
2868,"They have all kinds of hot dogs or sausages in buns, that you can try and enjoy. It is much better than the Supergawg place on millwaukee and devon. Recently they have been on TV. Good place.,"
2869,"Nice place if you fell like wasting away in line. Can you do carry out? Do you still have to wait in line?Sausages rock, duck fries not so much."
2870,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Why? Because it kicks ass. Let me elaborate:They don't try to do a lot of things. They focus on encased meats and then get wildly creative within that area. They serve a veritable Noah's Ark of animals throughout the year. I have eaten delicious animals from all over the world, wonderfully seasoned and served with surprisingly perfect appropriate toppings. I would never have thought to combine cherries, elk, and blue cheese but I am damn glad that Hot Doug's did.Other things to consider: 1) they have an inexpensive, amazing dog that used to be named the Shawon Dunston (now the Dave Kingman). Solid good eating for under $5. 2) Best corn dogs ever.3) Best fries in town. And I'm not even talking about the duck-fat fries (which are incendiary and inspiring like the true form of Zeus which burned poor Semele).4) The ginger beer they have in the cooler is also kick-ass and a perfect compliment.5) They sometimes have the Gyros-dog. It is everything you dream it could be."
2871,"Very good, but not worth all the hubbub! I'd rather eat at Wiener's Circle!!!!"
2872,"I can't say enough about this place. AMAZING!!!! Doug is awesome, along with all his encased meats."
2873,"Hot Doug's makes the best Italian sausage I have ever eaten. They butterfly the Italian so that it's got a nice char all over and room for the delicious hot giardiniera to rest. Combined with their excellent fries (have yet to even try the duck fat ones) and a bottle of Green River, it's my favorite lunch by a long shot (and darn cheap too).Doug's always there to take your order and emphatically thank you for placing it. After going there for lunch a handful of times he began to recognize me, making the Hot Doug's experience that much better. He tells me that the sausages are either made to their recipes or bought locally. This place is legendary for good reason.PS You can, for the most part, avoid the very long lines by going after 2:30pm."
2874,WOW ..what an amazing place. I'm just upset that this is the first I've heard of it. I was walking around in my neighbor hood when i saw a long line to get in to this place. We peeked inside and grabbed a menu to go by the time we made it home we called in an order and walked back for it. Completely worth it. DELICIOUS.....my new favorite .
2875,Hot Dougs is a Chicago Original and shouldn't be missed! Who ever thought encased meats could be so cool. I have to come back for the duck fat fries!
2876,Who knew hot dogs could be this good!!
2877,"Big time good stuff. Long lines - plan accordingly. Expensive, but supply-and-demand, ya know. Highly recommended."
2878,"0 Stars- The rude bouncer at the door ruined our visit. He singled out 1 person in our group and refused to let her in, then called us liars when we tried to tell him she wasn't even drunk. What a jerk. He had the short man complex, like he had to be a tough guy because he was so small and bald. Well needless to say didn't go in and we won't be back. Lousy customer service."
2879,"Terribly rude staff. I'll never go there again.Felt like I was under Nazi control, with their constant directives. Others sitting around us felt the same way.Staff also shouldn't drink on the job. I found that low-class.I don't care how legendary a bar is, there's no cause for the employees to behave in this manner."
2880,"My dad is a fan of gangster history so for father's day we tried to take him here. There is ALWAYS a cover...to add to that the guy at the door was trying to charge us more than the posted cover on the website! I must say, it's kind of sad that a place that has so much infamous history now hosts a weekly poetry slam. Al Capone should be rolling in his grave. We'll probably try to stop back earlier in the day the next time my dad is in town. Overall very disappointed. I'll give it 3 stars just because they're still around, in fairly original condition, and they have a great history (even if that can't be attributed to the current owners/employees). I hear the music is good...but from what I heard of the poetry I'd avoid this place on Sundays."
2881,Ok!1 so I went back with my friend for his birthday and there was a crowd of us again. This time it was a million times better. I didn't feel uncomfortable being there. It was a Tuesday night and the Lady playing the piano and singing with her very fun band was amazing. I think they play there every Tuesday night. I will go back to see them again. This time was 10 times better and the bar man was such fun and a delight to talk too. I can't remember his name but he had a beard and glasses I think. He opened the hatch to the down stairs so we could lean over the bar and look down into some history. So cool!!
2882,sabertooth is excellent. saturday nights is the time to be there!
2883,The Green Mill is an unpretentious world class venue where you can see great jazz and don't have to visit the ATM machine before you enter.People here are into music and you don't have to deal with a glorified yuppie environment.The drinks are old school and aren't watered down.I have enjoyed every event attended there.
2884,"It's ok. The place firmly rests on it's historical laurels. Mediocre service, very snotty doorman, just ok drinks. The music is usually quite good, but again not epic. I wouldn't call the decor preserved, it just hasn't been touched since the Capone days."
2885,"The green mill is a Chicago landmark for a reason. Great music almost every night, incredible ambience, good drinks and I think the staff is very friendly. The jazz music is some of the best I've seen around, and green mill can provide a fun change on a Saturday night. Can be a bit pricey but...Last time I went it was the after hours jazz party with Sabretooth."
2886,"Two stars for the style of this place. They lost three stars with us tonight because the service was absolute garbage. The door man was dismissive and the bartenders are inattentive and unfriendly. No one working there seemed happy to have customers. It's too bad because with better service, this place could be a gem."
2887,"Came here for the Poetry Slam! What a Shame! They were doing a Roast for someone that did not end until 9:30pm which only left 30 minutes for the poetry. The Poetry slam was to last from 7-10pm. The poetry slam was great, just wish it would of lasted longer. I may return, not sure."
2888,"Had an absolutely amazing night out here. Watched a poetry slam, drank too much, listened to jazz. Place is intimate and friendly, and feels super authentic. Everyone seems passionate and the drinks are well-made.Really awesome place."
2889,"EXCELLENT place to go to if you like Jazz/Blues music. On weekends they have a touring Jazz/Blues band play approx 8pm-12am...and then a regular band comes up on stage 12am-4/5am, and while they are playing invite other jazz musicians from the crowd to come up and do inprov with them (something I plan to do myself one of these days). The place is pretty small, and the crowd is usually full...so if you require seating i recommend getting there at least an hr early. There is never bad music being played here. The place is said to have been one of Al Capone's hideouts back in the '20s."
2890,"3 stars for the ambiance only.I went there with my fiance and we sat at the bar. Bartender was in my opinion very rude? well here is why: we ordered drinks and she was serving us like she was angry that we were there,no emotions on her face just very angry looking face. I appreciate a good customer service and in this case i wanted to leave after the first drink! At least say hi and smile.(you work for tips don't you?) we decided to stay (just because the jazz band that they had that night was great) and the second time we wanted to order, she wasn't even paying attention to us,mind you the place wasn't so packed yet, by the bar. and also why cant they hire a better looking bartenders! with more energy! and a smile on their face lol for Gods sake! the guy that was helping barback) was friendlier then the actual bartender! I never want to go back,but my fiance loves the place(just because AL Capone use to hang out there,and the jazz bands are good,ehhh guys thing i guess) but next time i wont be siting by the bar! Next time i hope will have a better service at the table..."
2891,"I have been coming to the Green Mill for more than 20 years and it hasn't lost one step in the quality of the music, the vibe of the space or strength of the pour ;). Thanks Green Mill!"
2892,"Nice place because drinks are strong, the music is great, decor and history is awesome. A nice place to watch and listen jazz music. Beer and drink prices are cheap-fair.The best thing about this is, this is where Johnny Depp Hung out."
2893,the history says it all. drinks are a little overpriced but that the only problem besides the stinky bathrooms but a bar that old cant reallly help that. Best live jazz in town.
2894,I have been here several times and every time was a good experience. Great atmosphere about the place probably because of the history behind it. If you never been its a must even if you don't listen to jazz music
2895,"One of my absolute favorite places in the city to grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere of a bygone era. So classy and lovely yet so comfortable. Great little joint. Bring your romantical partner, get there early to grab a seat, and enjoy some jazz by candlelight. I love dirty gin martinis and this seems like the perfect place to enjoy them!Sure, they may shush during the performances, but this is really a place you come to sit back and enjoy the music. There are so many bars where you can go to chat, and I think they do a great job of maintaining the integrity of the place and really making the music the central focus.My fiance and I were here last winter on the coldest night of the year, and it was so cozy and perfect. Definitely will return, hopefully sooner than later!"
2896,"LOVE IT. The house band alone is great live music, and seems most people go just to see them. Only been here a few times, but each time I met new people very easily, everybody is just friendly and cool! No dirty looks, no trouble, no attitude. WHEW! Glad I walked in."
2897,"Love, Love, Love the Green Mill. Love the ambiance, the music (thursday night big ban jazz), the doorman (Al). THe only isue is it gets crowded, but hey, when it's good, it's good."
2898,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! This place has got it all old town Chicago feel, great music and very nice staff. It is as though you step back into time with a mobster at the next table. I was shocked to see this place full on a Wednesday night.... This is a must see. Foe locals and visitors alike."
2899,i am new to town and i was told i should check out this place. i really enjoyed the music and atmosphere.GREAT JAZZ PLACE!!!!
2900,"The poetry slams on Sundays guarantees an awesome time! Every slam is different and original in its own way! At yesterday's they had a band from New Orleans with some members in full Mardi Gras Atire. The decor inside makes you feel like you are stepping back in time into another era. At only $6, this definitely has to be the best value for live entertainment in the city! The Green Mill is a bastion of originality, urban culture, and personality!"
2901,"this place is a classy joint and they make a killer martini. but some nights they have shitty poetry readings and other live music, which doesnt fit this type of place at all, and they shush the crowd. what the fucks up with that? its not the fucking symphony in here. people want to chat while they get their entertainment at a bar. i think its under new ownership or something because i feel like this is a more recent thing. if they would just cut the bull shit this place would be one of my favorites."
2902,"Awesome and great experience every single time! Perfect to enjoy the sound of great musicians and just feel at ease at this bar. The crowd can be enjoyable, even the lack of cigarette use has not devastated the bar."
2903,"This is my # 1 all-time top Chicago destination. Get there early (tables are tough to come by, and sneek under a cheap cover) and stay late (the music goes until the wee hours of the morning). Every night has its own feel, its own vibe. I love Sundays, when it is quiet and Gordon tears it up on a little late night Ella.The place is chill and the beer is cold (PBR on tap!) but the tunes are HOT."
2904,Great bar and heard some decent poetry. The poetry slam was fun.
2905,"Whenever I travel to Chicago, the Green Mill is one of my usual stops. There is a reason this place is legendary: a steady calendar of some of the very best jazz (of all different styles) that you are likely to find anywhere. And at reasonable prices, to boot, when compared to NY or DC.If you're there on a Wednesday night and jazz singer Kurt Elling is in town, you're in for a rare treat; this is his regular gig whenever he is back home. You'll be able to hear this multiple-award-winning jazz vocalist pretty up close and personal, for a fraction of what it would cost to catch him at venues in other cities, and in a setting where it's possible to chat with him between sets (and he's a charming, approachable guy).Whomever you catch there, be prepared to enjoy music among serious jazz afficianados, but also be prepared to be quiet. Talking during the performance is (blissfully) banned, and the staff usually enforces the ban firmly (and sometimes politely).It's worth it to get there early, because the place gets crowded quickly."
2906,I go swing dancing at the Green mill every thursday. It is best to come before the 2nd set. The dancing is a lot of fun but after the first set it gets mighty crowded. The music can be repetitive but I go more for the atmosphere than anything else. Great place to bring parents 50+
2907,"The Mill is a required stop when in Chicago. And if you live here, all the better. Every night has a different vibe, so if you don't like the swing stuff on Thursdays, try Kimberly Gordon on Sundays (come early for the Poetry Slam). You just have to go."
2908,"Great place to hear old (and new) school jazz. Points given for excellent atmosphere, great music and a decent beer selection. Points deducted for a sometimes snooty staff and certain clientele who seem to feel above the place itself. Often the crowd can feel touristy. Show up early enough (8:00 when the set starts at 9:00) or you'll be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the socialites. A great place...I just wish it were a bit less known to the trend-seekers."
2909,"If you havent been to the Green Mill,you havent lived in Chicago.Sunday nights are the best with Mark Smith and the Poetry Slam.Al Capone,tunnels,jazz and poetry (good and bad) about disparate topics ranging from teenage mutant ninja turtles to vampires.."
2910,"This place would get a 5 if it wasnt so crowded and their beer selection was a little bigger. But aside from that this place is great. Very good music, sunday night poetry is always fun and the place has a great aged feel to it. TIp: they allow you to bring food in or order in. So get there early, have a few drinks and order dinner in. Unfortuantly thats one of the only ways to get a good seat at this popular joint =/"
2911,Cory approved.
2912,"paid a $12 dollar cover only to walk in & receive rude & pretentious service from the bar staff. Ended up leavin without finishing our drinks. And I'm not just some disgruntled needy patron, I'm actually a 10 year service industry/bartender veteran. I know good service and I know bad. Green mills was definitely not good. It's a shame cause the ambiance is nice & the place has great character & potential. Oh well."
2913,"I love the Green Mill. When I go, I usually frequent it on Monday nights when they usually have the Patricia Barber Quartet performing. In fact, this review is mostly about Monday nights with said performers.The atmosphere is great. The waitstaff are attentive, professional, and respect the performers as do the audience.If you have not yet been on Monday nights to see the Patricia Barber Quartet, I highly advise you do. Check the calendar on the website to confirm said group is not touring abroad however. What else to say? The music is organic, sultry, sensuous, real and imagined, and the sound quality is top-notch.If you are looking for a semi-intimate and somewhat romantic getaway on Monday night, look no further. It will change your mind."
2914,i love this venue. cheap champange and nostalgic decor.. get up close and personal with the music..
2915,"Best jazz in the city and open late! Great decor, evidentally the original decor of the place. A little overcrowded with hipsters but it is a jazz bar so i shoulldn't have expected anything else. This place destoys all the blues bars down in the Depaul area."
2916,"Awesome music. Great drinks.At all costs, avoid the poetry slam night. Not sure what they're thinking. I want jazz, not bad poetry."
2917,This place is a classic and a must to go at least once in your life even if your not into Jazz. I took some visitors from out of town who wanted to experience a great Jazz joint The Green Mill is the first place I thought of. The Mill gets very crowded so if you want a seat go early. They have great drinks of all kinds and the staff is usually great. Different acts to see and just a over all great experience.
2918,"Classic!Everything a great jazz club should be. Dark, Crowded, eclectic mix of people. Martinis stirred, not shaken and served in the old fashioned glasses. Not to mention the music. You can catch some of today's best jazz performers up close & personal.Few places like this exist in the world..."
2919,"Worst bartender service ever. Go out of business and do all of us a favor. The one four-eyed bartender is a real piece of work. I look forward to seeing him working at McDonald's flipping hamburgers. What has this world come to where complete rude jerks without any educations are serving us alcohol and allowed to give us attitude. Al Capone would roll over in his grave. I can't wait to see the day when Green Mill is going out of business. It will be coming soon. The musicians will easily find a new gig to play at, where they actually aren't rude to their customers."
2920,"i love jazz and when i came to chicago, i was told green mill is the best place to go. i totaly agree with this. the atmosphere is amazing . it's a little club where you can drink something and enjoy live music. they serve no food, but you are allowed to bring your own and eat it in there, i never saw that before. the people are very friendly and you get your drinks quickly. the live shows at 8 pm normally starts one hour later, but there's always someone playing the piano behind the bar. the stage in in the back and you have a very good few from all the seats. it's a bit far from the center of chicago, but it's totaly worth it."
2921,"My daughter took me here for a birthday present, and it was one of the best presents I've ever had. The music was fantastic. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. I, personally, like the fact that they try to keep the noise down during the performances. I want to hear the music. We got there early for good seats and were able to enjoy conversation before the show and in between (three) sets. Chilled during the music. Would love to go back again when I'm in Chicago."
2922,"If you're in Chicago on a Sunday night, have a spare $6 and some scratch for a few drinks, you can't go wrong with the Green Mill. Even if you've got other plans -- this should *at least* be your backup plan. Sunday night Poetry Slam has never failed to be a great time. Marc Smith is probably one of the most accessible, friendly icons that you'll ever meet, and if you're standing at the bar during the break, he's about as likely to start a conversation with you as he is with anybody -- he's just that friendly.The staff. I've learned by observation -- be cool, respectful with the staff and they'll be cool and respectful with you. They're professionals, not peons."
2923,This has got to be one of the absolute best jazz clubs in the world. I've never been to a better jazz club anywhere in the US or Europe.
2924,"It sells itself. A classic Chicago bar, rich in history, in a classic Chicago neighborhood. For all you jet setters and tourists this place is pure Chicago. Classy too!"
2925,"I last went here a few years ago, I've known and watched a lot of music here and musicians and teachers I know personally perform here.I'm never going back.And I sincerely believe you are naive if you like this place. Sorry, I don't mean to insult those that enjoy the Green Mill, but this is NOT a jazz club anymore, its pure idiocy.DO NOT TELL ME TO BE SILENT IN A BAR! I come to a fucking BAR to have a drink, speak normally to the people I am with, and listen to music. IF YOU WANT SILENCE THEN MAKE IT A CONCERT HALL AND NOT A FUCKING BAR. I used to be able to speak at this place, even during the Vandermark-type avant-garde music - then some scenster dumbfucks must've taken the place over or something.Idiots. Pure idiocy. Music isn't meant to be listened to in silence, ESPECIALLY in a place like the fucking Green Mill! I've had sublime, serene listening experiences in silence - that is NOT what is going on here!!! Never in the entire history of jazz was music listened to in silence - and in fact back in the day in Europe, classical music concert halls weren't exactly silent either! If the audience is to be silent it will happen NATURALLY and appropriately due to the sublimity of the music. Not the crazy nazi way these jokers at the Green Mill do. Its too expensive, too stupid, filled with people who don't know any better and run by stupid fucks that need to get a clue. Yet another place that gets by on reputation. The music is high caliber, as always - just buy their music instead of going to hear them at this place."
2926,"THE place for jazz. Everybody else posting here pretty much nailed the decor and ambiance. A total step back in time. Now mind you, this is traditional jazz--piano, brushes on the snare, upright bassist...Never got that into jazz in its purist form--try the underground wonder bar in gold coast for the contemporary form with alot of energy. Unfortunately, lots of jazz snobs telling you not to talk. I mean , I like to hear the music too, but I also don't want to just sit in a library either. Sometimes the whole room just sits in absolute silence--kinda weird especially if you want to talk with your date.Gets pretty crowded the later it gets--you might end up standing. Poetry slam on sundays--kinda like sitting in someone's living room and playing charades..it's fun though, really!Lots of parking on the streets, but don't park too far and just get to the venue as this is definitely not the kind of neighborhood you just want to sightsee in..be careful! Great place, a must see on everyone's list."
2927,Really kick ass place! It is got to be one of the most historically interesting places in Chicago. The people that used to frequent this place and the fact that they have tried to keep the historical ambiance is very exciting!
2928,Happy Thursday! Only night I found dancing there.Also saw Vince Vaughn. Hmm.
2929,"you go on Saturdays at 12am, it's great.. see you soon"
2930,I loved it every minute.
2931,"Chicago is known for it's great live music scene, and one of the greatest venues around is the Green Mill. On weekends it's open late....I mean waaaaay late, 5am on Saturdays. The prices are pretty average and the clientele is a mixed bag of young and old hipsters, hepcats, yuppies, geeks, freaks, punks, jocks, anybody who digs a laid back atmosphere and the best live music in the city really.What's super hip is the circular booths towards the entrance, and the table/dance area right in front of the stage. So whether you're looking to converse with some great background sound, or get right in the mix, there's accomidations for you.The only downside is that it fills up pretty quickly on weekends, so get there before midnight if you want to catch a table, or else you'll be forced to stand at the super long, super curvy, fully stocked bar with attentive bartenders and waitstaff....really that's not so bad.Overall,People who dig jazz, dig the Green Mill."
2932,"Smokey, dark and not that fun. It's really laid back and has a dive like feel to it even though it's in such a good location. Not my favorite place but when the people I'm with want to go there I can make the best of it."
2933,"He loses a star for not being open 1/2 the time I go there. other then that, it rules!"
2934,"I posted this a year or two ago but will repeat my simple Hot Dougs strategy for beating the often long line. It helps that I work kitty-corner from Dougs, so this is easy for me, but here it is: first, go online to http://hotdougs.com and figure out what you want to order - then, just call ahead (773-279-9550) and place your order for pickup - it will be ready when you arrive (give them 5-10 minutes), you can walk right in past the line and either get it to go or grab a table on the spot if one's open (don't forget about the Al Fresco outdoor dining area - named after the used-car lot on Ashland where Doug bought his Dodge Dart)(I made that up). CAVEAT: they won't take phone orders on Saturdays, and they won't take advance orders for eat-in customers. Good luck!"
2935,"How can you not have gone here yet! Stop reading the reviews and get out! Mmmmmm, mmeat!"
2936,Yum Yum double Yum! All I have to say is Duck Fat Fries!
2937,"I want so badly to give this place 5 stars because the hot dogs are incredible. But at the end of the day, I just can't do it. I cannot give 5 stars to a business that hates work. That is just honesty. I really like Doug, but his work ethic makes me wanna jump out a window. They are never open, and when they are, they go at such a slow pace that the line is unacceptable long. I actually think he is doing it on purpose. Like when Playstation comes out and only releases a small amount of machines to generate buzz. No one can be that lazy. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays and they do not stay open after 4."
2938,"I don't think I ever left this place dissapointed.And I had a lot of different things.A couple days ago,just out of curiousity,I got a corn dog.I despise corn dogs with all of my heart,and I can only remember having one corn dog that I actually enjoyed (that was back when I was a kid).Goddammit,Hot Dougs.I'm addicted to your corn dogs now."
2939,The finest meal in the entire 50 states. I have no problem waiting hours and hours for the fine treats Doug makes. The Duck fries are my new thing.
2940,Anything less would be a lie. Believe in the power of the world's best encased meat emporium.
2941,worth the long wait in line.
2942,"Every time we go, I can't make up my mind and want to try at least 4 different things. The wild game sausages squick me out a bit so I don't get those. Sure, waiting in line is sometimes a pain - but it's also part of the fun. If you don't want to wait in line, don't go here. Plain and simple - it's not for everyone.No matter how crowded it is, they always manage to help you find a place to sit. The staff is friendly and I like that Doug insists on running the register and interacting with customers."
2943,"The rattlesnake hot dog is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.It's worth the wait in line and don't be afraid to try something new. They do a good job of pairing the unusual meats with complimentary toppings. When I'm scared, I usually get my favorite hot dog plus an exotic one. Just in case.The duck fat fries changed my life. I dream about them."
2944,"I am thoroughly addicted. The ribeye sausage with chimmi-churri is phenomenal. Ditto for the spicy pork hot link with the coca cola barbecue sauce. Any bacon sausage is well, bacon...how could it be bad, and the combinations of flavors Doug comes up with are really delectable. Yes, the lines are long...go early, but if you find yourself in a long line, don't fret...it moves fast, even my 2 year old can handle the wait. Try to eat there, as the fries tend to get steamed on the way home. And as for the fries, I am not a big fan usually, but I could eat an entire basket of the duck fries myself."
2945,Wonderful food. I especially love the fries in goose fat!
2946,"what's not to love about this place? i am a regular pete shelly kind of girl. but doug knowing his customers by name, his favorite buzzcocks songs in the background, and its growing group of chicago regulars make this independent business shine set."
2947,"OK, I am sure you know why I took away a star: the line to get in is extremely too long. Don't go hungry because it will take you 30 minutes to get inside.BUT- the remaining 4 stars is because Hot Doug's is the best Hot Dog place in the entire galaxy! If Aliens land: take them to Hot Doug's for a rattlesnake dog with honey drizzle and blue cheese! mmmmmm Add some duck fried fries and you are set for some intergalactic deliciousness! Their menu is always changing and is always fun. Order at least 2 dogs and make sure you vary your selection each time. Expect to pay $10-15 and you'll be super fine!!!yummy yummy yummy!!!! Bring some friends to pass the time in the stupid line."
2948,"Hot dogs were decent, But they didn't have much else on the menu, Growing up in Chicago I need options to stimulate my visit and return, Doug's isn't worth a hour long wait, Not worth traveling for, Way too many options in the city."
2949,"There's no need for a drawn out over inflated review of Doug's. When I contemplate going all I think of is the 1990's Nike slogan, Just Do It."
2950,"The best eats in Chicago (Sorry, Charlie Trotter). Those of us who waited forever for Doug to re-open are not disappointed. Doug's culinary combinations are spot-on. I have never had a bad meal here. I even got one of the last foie gras laced offerings (Quack, Quack, or is it Honk, Honk). This stuff is what carnivores were made for. Doug, don't change a thing. Please don't franchise, sell out, expand or change the decor. Your public needs you behind the counter."
2951,"I love me some hot dogs. Do you love hot dogs? Actually, I really don't care for hot dogs that much, but when you put fun things like blueberry Shiraz sauce on them and serve them with french fries fried in DUCK FAT, how could you NOT like them? This place holds strange hours, but I guess the owner can do that when people line up around the block in pouring rain just to come inside for some gourmet processed meat. This is a fun place to take visitors (ie parents, friends) for lunch on the weekends, but make sure they know that there WILL be a wait, and that seating is limited. Cash only!"
2952,"Listen, Doug seems like a really nice guy, BUT, well, in a word (or two) the food is greasy, greasy gross. And expensive. And the atmosphere, well, if you like lots of fat people stuffing french fries in their mouths while unsuccessfully attempting to stifle belches -- it's great! I'm sorry but this place is way over-rated. Not so HOT after all. One star."
2953,"no only are they the best dogs, the cheese fires are to die for, If they had a liquor license I'd move in. yummmmm, cant waite till they branch closer to the city."
2954,"Best hot dogs's in chicago. Not just your typical hot dog's. Tons of different kinds of sausage cooked different ways. Lots of toppings. The relish is bright green, neon green actually. They really know their stuff here. If it's busy don't turn away, we waited and it was great."
2955,No stars. This place sucks. This city is loosing its soul to yuppie places like this. A hot dog stand needs to be a hot dog stand! No fancy bull shit. But the people who go here can get a hot dog With KETCHUP and go home and watch Friends
2956,MMMMMMMMMMMMM...thats all I can say
2957,Best dogs. Call in advance to pick up your dogs. My favorite is the Thai dog. I love this place.
2958,"I normally don't like hot dogs as much, find nothing special about them and quite frankly, kinda boring. Hot Doug's makes them special and definitely not boring!!! The specials are just a feast, a dish that transcends the usual definition of a hot dog.Trust Doug on the toppings, he knows what he's doing, blue cheese and honey on a wild boar sausage was a divine combination. My wife decided to go with the usuals on her duck sausage despite Doug's quizzical looks and quite frankly, the mustard, ketchup and relish kinda overpowered the taste.The duck fat fries are as good as they are famous, but not just as heavenly as I thought they would be, given what happened to the hot dog. Still the best fries I ever had."
2959,Encase meats!!!! MMMmmm enough said!!Well almost the variety there is outstanding and the specials keep me going again and again!!
2960,"Being vegetarian, it is SO important to me to eat tons of veggie dogs in the summer. I used to work a few blocks away & my co-workers & I would stop by on our lunch break almost every day. They have a cute little outdoor area to eat that's hidden from the street, which makes your eating experience way better than street-side. Everyone that works there is friendly & always smiling. I think the owner is taking orders pretty much six days a week, which I find SO respectable.Also the line around the block can seem daunting, but it goes by quickly, don't fret."
2961,It's a long line. The hours are short. But nothing was going to come between us and our duck fried french fries! Definitely worth the trip and the wait....Make sure that yougo on a Thursday and come early to get your fries. The sausages are heavenly too!
2962,"I can't seem to eat at Hot Doug's. I came at 4:00 pm for an early dinner once, but they were closing. I can't stand in a long line with small children, I I probably wouldn't anyway, so I guess this restaurant is out for me."
2963,"This was good food but I felt a little let down. After weeks of planning to go here, I was a little disappointed at the food. The BLT was great!, but every thing else we had was just ok-Pork Shoulder, Salami/ Meat slices, Bone Marrow, and a decent Turkey Leg. I would recommend it to someone to try for themselves, but still a little disappointed."
2964,"A few doors south of Nordstroms is a restaurant with such colorful and tasty choices that they take no reservations! I arrive at 11;30am when they opened,there was already a line. My BFF and I shared several plates. The whipped feta with cucumbers and roasted cornwith heirloom tomatoes and arugula pesto disappeared quickly. The charred cauliflower was my BFF's pick. I don't eat cauliflower but was intrigued by the different colors in the small bowl. It was delicious! Although we were sharing, my BFF did not share her Wagyu sirloin tips with a bone marrow vinaigrette! I must try that next time. The octupus was tender and so flavorful! I have a sweet tooth, so dessert is always a must. The bread pudding was the perfect end to a lunch that ended much too quickly. I will find any excuse to return. It is my new go to place on Michigan Avenue!"
2965,"great place, great food. very trendy!highly recommend, trying to get a table for dinner might be a little harder. great menu for lunch!"
2966,"The Purple Pig is my go-to spot when I'm in Chicago. The menu is great and very pork-centric (obviously). I wont go into detail about all the things I've eaten, but only the ones that have definitely stood out. 1. Bone Marrow - Decadent and delicious. Smear some marrow on the toast, sprinkle a little sea salt, the salad and you are in heaven. 2. Pork Cheek with a fried egg. Let the yolk run over the pork. Enjoy fatty porky delictiousness.The staff is also very helpful and accommodating. When I arrived, the place was packed to the gills, but the hostess was very quick to find me a comfortable place at the bar. Any of my questions about the wine, food, or beer was also answered with apparent knowledge.This place is great for a meal of small plates, or just a couple of casual drinks and some cheese.Go to the Purple Pig."
2967,"Excellent service. Loved the beets with goat cheese, loved the pork fired almonds. Vey friendly, very chic."
2968,Horrible! Way overpriced for Chicago. Order never showed up while the kept pushing the overpriced drinks. Never again. Go to Eno across the street.
2969,"Absolutely fantastic! Loved the food, the ambiance and our server (Heather)...my new favorite place!"
2970,"I have never been in a restaurant this loud. It was pretty cool. This is considered one of the top restaurants in the country, so I might have been a little outclassed.The alcohol was expensive but good.I showed up with my gf, and I was seated at the bar immediately.All of the food that we ordered was interesting and tasty. It was a place that I was happy to go to, but I doubt that I would return on my next trip to Chicago. We had:Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana - my favorite. It was about a one cup container.Chorizo Stuffed Olives - Again, this was a very flavorful dish, one I would have never considered. 6 olives.Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - This was tasty, but honestly I could have made this. It was a big pork steak well-cooked.Manila Clams, House Made Merguez Sausage,Manzanilla Sherry & Tomato - Again, it was good, but the portion was small. IWe actually left the restaurant still able to eat more. The food was good, but the portions were small."
2971,"Delicious, unique food. Expect a 1-2 hour wait, but you can buy a bottle of wine and sit outside until you get a table. We had the pig ears, the foie gras, cheese plate and pork secreto, all of which were fantastic. The plates are small, they recommend 2-3 items per person. It's worth the wait!"
2972,good food. Didnt like the setting plan. but in a whole i would say its good enough to return.
2973,"Very good, like all the pork dishes, sardines were great, veggie dishes usually just ok, sometimes not worth the wait for a table."
2974,"Went with a group of friends and as a big eater didn't expect to be filled by small plates. However, each plate was delicious and well worth the trip. Got to try some amazing new foods like bone marrow and octopus that I never thought I would like. Would definitely return as the first dish was just as good as the last."
2975,Little crowded for me but great food. Fun lunch spot.
2976,i will give five stars for the super great food!BUT negative ----100000000000000000 points forWAITRESS name ALEXA!!!!!terrible attitude horrible service. I am a very good tipper but I simply wanted to give her 0% tip.Hope she does not go into service business for her sake.
2977,"Food was AWESOME! Super-creative menu, nice wine/beer selection. Sat at the bar as there was a wait for tables. Service was a little slow, but I highly recommend!"
2978,"We picked this restaurant with the help of other yelpers and were pleased with our pick. We had a bit of a wait which was fine b/c there was enough room to hang outside and review the menu while enjoying a glass of wine or a cold beer if desired. After waiting our expected wait time, I inquired how much longer we had as we had a prior engagement we needed to get to and we were told they would be seating several parties so we continued to wait. After about 15 people were seated, I inquired again and the hostess rudely advised that she looked for us & couldn't find us which was BS b/c we were standing where we should have been. They keep track of people by their clothing and a brief description. We were eventually seated and enjoyed a great lunch and a bottle of wine. The chorizo stuffed olives were my favorite and something I will crave for a long time. We shared several items and had both of the paninis they feature on the menu which were both unique and tasty. Besides the snotty hostess, I really enjoyed this place!"
2979,"We were visiting Chicago and happened to pass by Purple Pig. Great food! Everything on the menu was delish. The only con would be the too tight seating arrangement and if you are not seated outside (we were initially sitting outside but it started raining and they moved us inside), the noise inside is way too loud that you have to yell at each other to talk. Overall, a must place to dine."
2980,I WILL BE BACK!!!I love closing the place out!!!
2981,I don't even eat pork and I love the purple pig! Small but cute inside (albeit there are always a fair number of tourists given the location on Michigan ave) but still love this place!This is a great place for a leisurely weekend lunch with wine. We've never had to wait very long for a table in the late afternoon.Best meatball slider ever. Order it. I also love the octopus. And then the whipped feta.I like the portion sizes because you can try a lot of things.
2982,"The food was amazing. I love how knowledgeable my server was. her name was Natalia. She knew so much about the wine list and what foods would complement the wine etc and so forth. She was very helpful and when the appetizer we ordered was sold out, she brought us another option on the house! It was incredible. We loved Natalia and we will definitely ask for her to be our server next time.Thanks girl!"
2983,My friendsand I were looking forward to eating here but the night we went they didn't have alot of items on the menu. We asked for the General Manager to complain and ended up being a complete asshole aout it. Would not recommend this place.
2984,"Excellent food, comfortable atmosphere, friendly & unpretentious wait staff. Did I mention excellent food? Everything ordered was delicious to the last bite. The small plates didn't fill us up and the waiter was really good about checking back to see how we were doing and if we wanted more selections. No reservation - we walked in at 5:15 and had a seat (I'm sure the wait is longer as it gets closer to the trendy dinner hour). In contrast, the Girl and the Goat required a three week reservation, we weren't seated until we were all there (one person stuck in traffic), we were rushed by the wait staff and had a fairly miserable experience."
2985,"4 words...milk braised pork shoulder. I literally have dreams about it every night. Order it....no actually, order three because I guarantee you will not want to share it with anyone and you will want leftovers to last you through the week...It's just simply delicious upon all levels. Incredibly tender and flavorful!"
2986,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of bone marrow. I love it, so any restaurant with it on the menu is automatically intriguing. I went there with high hopes one late afternoon and I wasn't disappointed. The Purple Pig does bone marrow right! Delicious crunchy bread, yummy bone marrow with salt, parsley and capers as garnish. The fried olives were fun. The artichoke and fingerling potato salad was nice and tangy. Great coffee too. If I lived in Chicago, the Purple pig would be in heavy rotation.Very pretty and european style set up inside. Nice outdoor seating."
2987,"This whole in the wall is classy and has a great menu. If I just want a small plate or just want a simple glass of wine, this is the new place on Michigan Ave! Beets and Beers, they have a great menu hands down!"
2988,"I was so excited to check out Purple Pig after hearing some great things... I'd heard some bad things too, but discounted them since the restaurant was relatively new at the time and working through 'growing pains' at that point (I thought)... I decided to reserve judgment and didn't head there until it had been open almost a year. When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation, we were told the wait would be at least 40 minutes. I don't mind waiting for a table (up to 2 hours) when I don't have a reservation. However, when I have a reservation, I don't expect to show up on time and wait for 40 minutes. What's worse is that our table was not actually ready in 40 minutes, but closer to 70. There was no accommodation made by the wait staff or management after such a long wait (and several 'check-ins' regarding time) such as a round of drinks, apps, etc. Furthermore, the staff was exceptionally snotty and rude, making our entire dining experience completely distasteful and atrocious. The food was actually quite good, but the entire experience was so clouded by the rude staff, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone."
2989,We started with giant lima beans and tuna. Next we had the fried pigs feet cakes and delicious fried brussel sprouts. We finished with milk braised pork shoulder and mashed potatoes. It was all excellent and the atmosphere was fun and friendly.
2990,"Good food but very small portions. If you are hungry you'd have to spend at least $30 on the small dishes to have enough (and that is not including drinks.) Our favorite actually contained no pork.....it was the Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde! The grilled octopus was very tender and flavorful. Other favorites: bread croquettes - but you only get 6 small balls for $5. Bread pudding with citrus - served warm and just the right amount. A great ending to our lunch. Misses: Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, PickledCherry Peppers & Fried Egg. The tastiest thing on this dish was the fried kale. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. Interesting but would not order again because realistically the bone marrow had little flavor. Service was pretty good although we informed our waitress that she forgot a $22 charge on our check and she seemed more embarrassed than thankful. They validate parking at a certain lot (forgot which one) but call ahead to find out."
2991,"Yumm yumm yummmThe big bad wold huffed and puffed and got the best wine and swine meal ever!!!I love love love this restaurant, i have been there maybe 7 time know and will continue to go! The beet salad, the eggplant and bread dish and he chicken thigh is sooo good, as well as all the other dishes i had but cant remembe the names for were delicious too. I love the decor i feel like im back in spain even though i would classify the restaurant as meditereanan tapas. regardless a must try in chicago!!"
2992,"DELICIOUS! Everything we ordered was amazing. The milk braised pork shoulder, the fried brussels sprouts, the artichokes & fingerling potatoes and the fried olives stuffed with chorizo...wonderful.The only downside is that it's a pretty small space and it was packed! We heard everything the people sitting next to us had to say and it took a little too long in between the veggies & the meat dishes. BUT this place has a spot on my top ten list."
2993,"Hmmmm ... how do you rate a place where food was very good, service very attentive, but the music and volume level made your ears bleed? The place was packed with plenty of lively conversation providing natural ambiance but the place felt compelled to keep increasing the music volume so it could still be heard. Even our server apologized for the volume level. (The restaurant patrons were all my age and older -- 40+ -- with plenty of discretionary income and I'm sure the same tolerance to volume).I doubt my friends and I will return. Sad."
2994,"Came with my girlfriends to celebrate an engagement. Pros: All the food was excellent. All of it. Outdoor seating was nice, although I wish they'd had the heat torches going because it was chilly. Cons: Doesn't take reservations. 90+ minute wait. But it's a new, trendy place, so I understand that. We received terrible, terrible, service. Ben, I'm looking at you, and I remember your name because you might be the most disinterested, woe-is-me and above-it-all server I have ever encountered. Disgusted when we asked for recommendations, annoyed when we wanted to order more food, and generally just irritated at our general presence. It really burned me that he got a 20% mandatory gratuity from our party of 6 because he was clearly---CLEARLY--a 10% kind of guy. And you've really got to suck to get that low. Purple Pig, had it not been for this, I would probably return."
2995,"I ate at The Purple Pig for the first time (finally) earlier this week with a friend, and I couldn't have been more impressed. We were greeted warmly at the door, and while we were told we had to wait about 30 minutes for our table, the staff was extremely welcoming, and promptly helped us get situated with some wine while we waited. Once seated (about 25 minutes later), we took the liberty of ordering a ton of items from the menu. I don' teat a lot of meat, and while I knew from looking online beforehand that there were several dishes I would be able to enjoy, I had no idea how many until the menu was placed before us...there must have been at least 25 or more items that involved chicken, seafood, veggies and more. A vegetarian could eat very happily here (the corn salad, the beets, and the butternut squash were my favorites). My friend - a really adventurous eater - was also in heaven. As the food poured out from the kitchen, there wasn't a single dish I ordered that I didn't enjoy. The chef, who we had a chance to meet at the end of our meal, executed everything to perfection. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient, and the manager (I didn't catch his name, but he has red hair/beard and a really fun, kind personality) stopped by our table a couple of times over the course of our 3-hour visit to make sure everything was to our liking. Tantalizing food, excellent service from top to bottom, and, in my opinion, unmatchable energy in the dining room. The Purple Pig truly reminded me of why I love dining out in Chicago.Love, love, love. Already planning my next visit!"
2996,"After a day of sight seeing we decided to follow the reviews we'd seen at eat at The Purple Pig. It was very busy for a Monday night- even for a table for 2. The hostess first tried to sit us across from each other in the middle of a packed table. After waiting 5 more minutes we were sat next to each other. Even sitting next to each other, it was tough to hold a conversation due to the volume- even being on the patio. The server was very helpful explaining how the menu worked and made great recommendations. Everything we tasted was fabulous and really filling. The two of us shared 3 items (not the recommended 3 items per person!)."
2997,"DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR!!! It's a wonderful place with a wonderful atmosphere, but when we went we sat at the bar and spent the entire time wishing we hadn't! Two brain dead bar-backs kept trying to figure out what they should be doing....(male and female) while the pseudo long-haired, short male bartender AND the big breasted female bartender completely ignored the bar patrons while they swigged wined.....got loaded and wasted our time. It was awful! When we FINALLY did get our food order it was great! The wine is great! But the idiots behind the bar ruined our visit. We plan to return.....sit at a table and allow the capable waitstaff to make our visit less annoying."
2998,"late night hours and great share plates. Its great to have restaurants like purple pig, longman & eagle and gilt bar opening up in chicago. The more the better!"
2999,"Who says you HAVE to get the pig stuff? Got the chicken kebabs and the fried sardines! (both of which were very good: the chicken was juicy and tender, if not a little boring; the sardines were fried to perfection)But, of course, our group ordered lots of pig stuff (you have to you have to...both because this is the purple pig and also because its so good). 1. The bone marrow was very good and obviously quite rich. I found after the first couple slices of toast it became too much, but I definitely encourage you to try it.2. The pork shoulder is a favorite of mine. I've been to the purple pig a couple times now, and this is one of my favorite dishes. 3. Finally, the pig's ear with crispy kale! If you could only order one dish, get this one! The pig's ear is deliciously fried, complemented with cherry peppers and a fried egg, and of course the crispy kale, which is so well fried."
3000,"A week later and I still dream about going back!If you could lick everything you love in the Museum of Contemporary Art, the purple pig is what it would taste like.Stop reading these reviews and just go."
3001,Ummmm -- pork and stuff is sooo 2009. Whatever.The place is trying too hard to be something that just came and went. The staff was uninspired and the place felt cold and not interesting.Don't waste your time or money.
3002,I was disappointed with the rude service and wait time. The food was not spectacular like the other reviews say. Maybe I went at a bad time or it was just a bad day.
3003,"I'll keep this short and simple. Too much going on in all the dishes. I want to taste my PIG, not have it hiding in flavors. Everything we ordered looked better than it tasted. This only means one thing, they are trying to hard to be somebody there not. The pig is my favorite animal to eat and they ruined it for me. If your materialistic and want to be fooled, go here. If your smart and you know your pig, you'll know where to go. Simplicity is the best and The Purple Pig is not. Two stars because the staff was nice, otherwise one star for the food."
3004,"Stopped in here two nights ago for a quick bite with an out of town family member. I'd never been here before but she was staying at the Marriott and we wanted somewhere nearby. When we arrived the restaurant was packed, but we were actually able to get a table about 25 minutes later. There was outdoor terrace seating within an enclosed tent setup for winter. There were large space heaters so the area was actually quite warm, but with everyone walking in and out of the restaurant itself, we decided that sitting inside would be less hectic.Most of the plates are small and so you'd want to order about 2-3 plate a person. We went with the mixed green salad to start, it had an unusual but yummy mint red wine dressing. If was super fresh and we devoured it. We also ordered the cheese plate which is furnished by Pastoral Artisan Cheese Shop. Next we had the prosciutto bread balls, which were good, not great. They were less flavorful than we expected. Finally, we had the milk braised pork shoulder... it was by far the most delicious part of the meal. So tender that you could break it up with the side of your fork. The mashed potatoes were buttery, delicious, and very smooth. It was the perfect way to wrap up the meal!Overall a really great experience!"
3005,"I had the chance to visit this place about a month ago and I was very pleased with the atmosphere, the food, drinks, and the waitstaff. I would definitely frequent this place again in the near future. Great after work place to gather with co workers or friends---the appetizer's are nicely priced and delicious!"
3006,"SORT BY DATE. READ THIS REVIEW. SEE SOMETHING IN COMMON? FOOD GOOD......SERVICE SUCKS! That is the only constant about this place. Great food...horrible service. I do not yelp, I thought this was a useless website, however i had an experience that motivated me here today. I have dined at the Pig 3 times. Once at the bar. This is what you need to know. great food, small portions. you'll drop 300 with a party of 4. However, the service is so bad its amazing that it can be categorized in the hospitality business. It should be re categorized into condescending experiences. Reminds me of getting ripped off by a mechanic without the smile.There is nothing hospitable about any of this staff. The servers and manager have always been aloof. It was as if I should thank them for allowing me to be there. In this friggin economy? Maybe if Avec, Blackbird, Bristol, Publican, and all the other restaurants that can deliver on both sides of the dining out experience. It is not enough to just offer great food at 100 bucks a head. You need to offer service just like all these other places do. Look at all the reviews people. The same reoccurring trend Great food.....Horrible service."
3007,Wonderful experience. Loved the concept and service. The owner made time to visit our table despite the restaurant being packed. Will definitely be back with a group of friends.
3008,"Was ok - not as great as all of the review I read. Pork shoulder was tasty, but the rest was mediocre."
3009,"Been there twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. As many have said before, the food is indeed great. However, the drink prices are excessive -- even for the location. We had a great glass of pinot for $24.00. I liked it so much I looked it up after our visit and found it was selling for $21.00 per bottle. I felt totally ripped off. I understand restraunts make their money off of alcohol, but two beers and two glasses of wine with our meal came to $70.00."
3010,"I wrote a review about this restaurant just a couple of days ago and it has been removed . I find this to be sadder than anything . It wasn't a flattering review but it wasn't a flattering experience so I wrote what happened. All I want to say is good luck purple pig . I hope other people have a better experience there than I did but removing reviews to put up the facade that you are a perfect restaurant is ridiculous . You can still read my review if you check my profile to those yelpers interested . I can see why they wouldn't want the review read because the whole thing was an embarrassment . I eat at restaurants all over the world , and great ones at that . I heard great things about this place but they all turned out to be untrue in so many more aspects than I care to examine . I will never go back to the purple pig . It is about as classless as I have ever seen ."
3011,"Came here for a late lunch, early dinner. The service was horrible. First, we sat there for over 10 minutes before we were greeted, when finally a waitress came over and tool our drink order. As soon as she walked away another waitress came over with the same robot introduction. It was mid afternoon, and not busy. We received our drinks and ordered appetizers. The house made meats were good. Cheeses were also very good, and a great assortment. Our waitress never came back to take our order for the rest of our food. Never in the dining room so I couldn't even get her attension. She was chit chatting with the bus boy and the other servers while we were waiting and waiting. We finally ordered the rest of our meal and it was good. Not anything amazing or memorable. Definatley not worth $150 price tag without tip for 2 ppl. Probably not coming back."
3012,"First night dining during first trip to Chicago; chosen because Burnham Hotel magazine said Bon Apetit touted it as one of 10 Best New Restaurants in America; was not dissappointed.Late dining, crowded/noisy inside, opted for table outside, which turned cold because we were not close to one of the heaters; (we were able to move a little closer to a heater after other diners left). Great waitress, Paige, and sommelier came out and gave us recommendations for other restaurants (1) for the rest of our stay. (We were lucky to get into (1) Schwa and already had reservations at TRU.)We liked the following the most:1.- Amazing deep fried deviled egg on a bed of perfectly dressed arugula with caper berries.2.- Again, perfectly dressed asparagus/hazelnut salad3.-Wagyu sirloin tip with summer beans, cherry tomatoes &tomato vinaigrette ( a third great vinaigrette!)With a Lageder Pinot Grigio, that we started out as a half bottle and ended up drinking the other half.We liked it sooo much, that we went back for late lunch before flying back to Berkeley, (and ordered the Wagyu again, no deviled egg available at lunch, but had the fried manchego/membrillo vinaigrette).Highly recommend this fun place."
3013,Do you need a reso??? They don't take reso's! Oh yes they do:) Ask for an SRX and tell them you are a concierge from any hotel in Chicago and you will not have to wait....ENJOY
3014,"Man...oh... Man! What a great place. I *heart* this place! My friend from work found this place when she was traveling on one of her conferences and insisted I go if I ever went to Chicago. So the first chance I got to travel to Chicago, I made my boyfriend take me here. It was AMAZING. The ambiance is very nice, we were seated in a long table with some random people and were able to ask them what they were eating and how they liked it. We tried the Salt Roasted Beets, the eggplant, various cheeses and oodles and oodles of wine! The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about wine. Last week I made my boyfriend take me here again and we discovered the rillette (pork shoulder) and finally got the crispy pig ears! We sat at the bar this time since we were able to find bar seats before our table was ready. The bartender was great in recommending wines that we would enjoy. Loved the food, the wine and the prices were really good too."
3015,"Given the prevalence of dining opportunities in Chicago, I found it offensive that they don't accept table reservations. I have dined here before and it is not worth waiting an hour and a half for a table. In short, you are better off taking your dining cash to another place that values your time and allows one to make a table reservation like the rest of civilized society.The hype is just that, hype."
3016,"The food was amazing. We started with three cheese selection - the truffle cheese was the best. We also had the almonds fried in bacon, which was just ok. My favorite two dishes were the grilled octopus and the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. The seating was the only negative thing about the restaurant. It's communal tables, which is no problem at all, but we were sat near the door and people who were waiting for tables were practically standing on top of us and kept bumping into the backs of our chairs. I will def return."
3017,"The Purple Pig was so good! I loved it! The best thing about this restaurant is their small portions which allowed us to order tons of stuff and share it. We even shared with the couples (who were strangers) sitting next to us at the communal tables! The wine selection was amazing, and I still have cravings for the deep fried deviled egg."
3018,"The food is good. The service.. the waiters are very nice and they really try.. but the place is crowded so its very difficult to receive a good service. The food is good.. original.. unique.. a little expensive... and the music is TERRIBLE.. it doesn't have anything to do with he concept of the Restaurant.. at all.. is like heavy rock.. it's annoying. The hostess are not very nice and I think they should try to look a little better or at least wear something that help the client recognize them, they are wearing normal clothes.. .. but the bartenders are very nice.. highly recommend the squash.. the pork neck.. and the pistaccio ice cream."
3019,"If you like crowds and overpriced Dominick's deli fare, by all means drop by The Purple Pig. There was not a single meat or cheese on the menu that stood out as unique. I could put together a better charcuterie spread at home with a quick stop at nearby Fox and Obel. If you do stop by, skip the deep fried deviled egg. The deep fried brussel sprouts were the highlight of this mediocre, over-priced meal. There is nothing special about The Purple Pig."
3020,"Went here for a late dinner and was very impressed. A small venue means that it is very crowded especially in the winter when the outside patio is closed but the wait wasn't too bad and the bottle of wine helped pass the time. The food was delicious. The only part of the meal I didnt truly enjoy was the tuna appetizer. However the fried prosciutto balls were amazing and the chicken dish w/ the yogurt was equally great. However the dish that took the cake was the pork shoulder. I was able to cut through it with a spoon and the meat just melted in your mouth. A small drawback is that because it is so crowded and the seating is communal is that you sometimes have to talk quite loudly in order to talk during dinner. Even with that though, will be making many return trips here."
3021,"Nice location off Michigan Avenue, has small portions and great cheese and wine list, this place was fun and the food was great!"
3022,"The food here is unbelievably delicious!! If you get here late on weeknights or weekends this place is packed beyond imagination...so be prepared to wait at least an hour o be seated. But trust me it'll be worth the wait. Also, be ready to make new friends because 80% of tables are shared seating"
3023,"This is a review of the management. I went in for an interview and soon realized that it was basically a cattle call. The manager was rude, condescending, and if this is the way he treats prospective employees, I can only imagine how he treats everyone else. I would never eat here and would recommend everyone else not to since this guy was such a jerk."
3024,"After visiting The Purple Pig on multiple occasions for lunch and dinner since the restaurant opened, it is easy to see why Buon Appetit magazine recently rated it one of the country's ten best new restaurants. The food is delicious. The staff is very helpful, always professional, and they look good too. The atmosphere rocks. At Michigan and Illinois with outdoor patio seating, it is up there with Chicago's best. I have broken down their menu by section below. What I recommend: Antipasti: Pork Fried Almonds (You never thought an almond could taste this good.) Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans (This is a must try!) Salads: Mixed Greens with Feta, Radishes and Red Wine Mint Vinaigrette (I don't eat salad often, but this dish makes me want to start.) Fried Items: If you can, try everything from this section of the menu. I highly recommend the Prosciutto Bread Balls and Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers and Fried Egg. The Melrose Peppers are a must have. Panini: The Salami Toscana, Goat Cheese and Black Olive Tapenade Panini makes for a great lunch. Cured Meats and Cheese (I combined these 2 sections of their menu because, ideally, they would be eaten together): You won't find them like this anywhere else in Chicago. All of them are must haves especially the Prosciutto di Parma. Smears: I've never really been a big fan of feta cheese but I wish I had a jug of the Purple Pig's Whipped Feta with Cucumbers in my refrigerator at all times because it is that damn good. a la Plancha, etc.: The Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Pork Blade Steak are two of my favorite dishes of all time anywhere. These are must haves. You can't go wrong with either. The desserts are all very good. I just had the Panino con Nutella the other night. I will definitely order that many more times in the future. I haven't even began to discuss the drinks at The Purple Pig. Their wine list is very deep and broken up by region. They have a couple of Italian red wines from Calabria that go awesome with dinner. The beer selection is intriguing; you will find something that you like. If you have any questions, ask a member of the staff. They are experts and will easily find something to your liking. I hope this review was helpful. The Purple Pig should be at the top your list for restaurants to check out in Chicago."
3025,"A month or so back, I went to the Purple Pig with a group of six of my closest friends from high school to have our yearly reunion. After 8 years of having these reunion dinners, we have finally found a home. Instantly, the atmosphere, ambiance, music, and full house (on a MONDAY!) struck a chord with us that we had chosen the perfect restaurant. Instantly, we could feel that we were going to have a great time. Not being big wine connoisseurs, the extensive wine list could have been a little intimidating; however, it was quite easy to follow. I was personally happy to find a wine from my grandparents' small hometown in Italy, for a very reasonable price. Even better, the bottle was great and we all ended up sharing many bottles over the course of the night. As for the food, all I can say is that it was unreal. Being in a decent sized group, we all chose something that we wanted to try and passed the plates around to share. We were able to enjoy a large chunk of the menu from the Salt-Roasted Beets, Corn and Tomato in an Arugula Pesto for starters; to the in house cured meats; followed by a lengthy stop in the Smears section which included the Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio, Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese (table favorite), Whipped Feta with Cucumbers, and Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs; over to the Fried Items where we had the Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg and Prosciutto Balls; and ending with Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (table favorite) and Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki for our entrees. As you can see, we thoroughly enjoyed the food and just kept eating and eating. We ended the night with some grappa. Once more, this was personally appeasing to me since I have not had the chance to enjoy some since my grandfather passed, along with his homemade wines and grappa. The night was perfect; we had the perfect setting in that the place was lively, and us being single guys, was filled with attractive women that the communal seating allowed us to mingle and interact with. I've already been back to the Pig and so have many of my friends. On top of the exceptional food and wine that is readily available, it also provides a multiple array of social settings, be it a place to have a nice romantic date or family dinner, go out with a group of friends and enjoy new foods, or have a small bite to eat and a glass of wine while meeting new people. One last thing is that the service was exceptional. Our waitress was very helpful with any questions we had regarding the wine list and menu. We had to wait a little which was expected with how busy the place was, but we were able to get some wine while we waited for a table. The chef, who is around our age, came over and talked with us for a bite. He was very modest and a nice guy. He went over to other tables as well and I found that to be a nice touch. Having been back there, he and some of the staff have remembered who I am and always find time to say hello."
3026,"Awesome, awesome, awesome..and crowded. Food is meant for sharing and small portions keep the calories under control. All of it excellent, tasty and wine to die for. Service was attentive but not overbearing. When we moved inside to keep the party going at the bar, service was down a notch, but they were packed. Get there, worth it!"
3027,"Probably one of the best meals I have ever had in Chicago. The food was small plate and inventive. Why only 3 stars out 5? Read on and I'll explain. The pork braised milk shoulder was divine. So rich it melted in your mouth. Salted beets with goat cheese were a bit too salty for my taste, but hey thats me. Wine list was approachable and expansive enough that it covered even obscure regions. Service was prompt yet not over bearing. Server (Gina) was always available when needed yet not trying to shove courses down your throat to push the check. It's nice to be served by somebody so adorable and sweet. My issue came when I noticed one of the members of the management team adjusting themselves constantly, basically right in front of our table. You know a male member (dual meaning). Absolutely disgusting. My wife could not believe what she saw! I'll go back........when that is eventually gone from my memory."
3028,"My family and I traveled all the way from the suburbs to try this hot spot for Sunday lunch. 5 of the dishes my family ordered were out, at noon! Then the dessert we wanted was out. The manager was gracious and sent desserts but we will not make the trip again."
3029,This is my must go to restaurant when in Chicago. I love the atmosphere as soon as you step in the place. I usually choose to sit at the bar next to the pass so you can see all the dishes going out. I have yet to have a dish I have not liked. My all time favorite is the Crispy Pig Ears with the fried egg on top. Sounds weird but I can't get enough of that dish. The Bone Marrow is a must try. Also the Beets with Goat Cheese is a great way to start. This place is out of control good. I have been there 3 times during my last two trips to Chicago. Perfect for the late night bite too. Not sure I want too many people to find out about this place it is already really busy so my selfish side is saying I shouldn't post this.
3030,"great food with bold flavors and great execution, good service and fun atmosphere."
3031,"Went to the Purple Pig on Friday night with my girlfriend. When we got there around 7:30pm, we were told that the wait time was approx. 1 hr (note: they do not take reservations). We decided to get a drink at Watershed (Ohio and State) in the meantime. We went back to Purple Pig after about 45-50 mins, and were seated a bit early. The place is not as loud as other reviews say, and we didn't mind close quarters because the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. To start, we ordered a bottle of Cote du Rhone, which was reasonably priced, and the sommelier was hysterical (but knowledgeable). The first dishes we ordered were the roasted bone marrow and brussel sprouts. Keep in mind I would never have ordered bone marrow in my life had I not gone into this dinner with an open mind. The bone marrow was really good and interesting... the brussel sprouts were good, not great, kind of tasted like caesar salad. We then got the eggplant parm balls and the pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg. Eggplant parm balls were tasty, but a small-sized dish. The pig's ear was unbelievable - if you're thrown off by the fact that it's a pig's ear, close your eyes and pretend it's calamari. Probably the best dish on their menu. Afterward, we ordered the braised pork shoulder and prosciutto de parma. The pork shoulder was delicious, and the prosciutto was really good/fresh. When you're ordering, space out your dishes so that they do not all come at once. Things come fast out of the kitchen. Overall, the Purple Pig is easily the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago, and one of the best meals I've had in a long time."
3032,"The unique offerings of small plates here can't be beat... it's now one of my go-to places in the city. If you haven't been, check out the Pig - you won't be disappointed!"
3033,"omg this place is to die for. i like, dream about it. european-style eating, communcal tables makes it fun and adventurous. ate marinated fried chorizo stuffed olives, an amazing panini, goat-cheese and eggplant tapenade (more please!) and somethng with a fried quail egg- crazy eating made with love. great location too. expect a wait!!"
3034,"salted roasted beets w/goat cheese = a little heavier than i would've likedoctopus with fingerlings and green beens = super good and delishscallop spiedini = seared to perfection.... def recommendopen face blt= unique and full of flavor, loved thisbraised shoulder = great concept and flavor, but a little on the salty side.pork neck bone gravy w/ricotta = tastes good, but nothing special. just seemed like a heavy tomato sauce with a kick.all in all, i liked it - it was good service, good atmosphere, unique in it's own way, and the food was overall tasty and hearty. I will say that it was a little bit on the heavy and saltier side... but it's kinda expected if you're going that specialized in pork! My only complaint was that it was a bit difficult to find from Michigan Avenue."
3035,Comfortable atmosphere indoors and outdoors. Have been here three times and always enjoyed talking with the people sitting near me. Fresh menu selections.
3036,"We were blown away! Unique spin on pork dishes, and what we tasted was incredible. We had beets with goat cheese (a must), pigs ear (sounds weirder than it tasted... delicious), and pork shoulder with mashed (the best of the three). If there's a wait, just eat at the bar. Worth a visit, for sure!"
3037,"Just had a fantastic late lunch here. It was just me so I ordered the salami, goat cheese and olive tapenade panini, a side of prosciutto, and for dessert, the nutella, banana and marshmallow dessert panini.The savory panini was amazing and I can't recommend it enough. Note that it consists of 2 sandwiches - so this was slightly more food than I was expecting, although they weren't huge so it wasn't a problem. The prosciutto was okay - I like mine with more flavor but it was still very good. The dessert was excellent and definitely worth trying, but it is literally the same as the other paninis, but with powdered sugar on top. So for me, there was too much bread and not enough of something else on the inside - I think it needed more nutella and probably needed to slice the bananas a little thinner so you could consistently get the flavor of the 3 components.Only major downside was the music - I sat inside and the music (I sort of hesitate to call it that) involved a lot of very loud yelling without anything musical going with it and was on very very loud. It seemed very unnecessary as I was there in the mid-late afternoon and there were few patrons inside."
3038,"LOVE this place, and I'm no pork lover--I'm a vegetarian. The vegetable dishes are fabulous and certainly no afterthought as they are at many restaurants that focus on meat. Wonderful selection to choose from, especially loved the salted beets and whipped feta smear. Bread is great, waiter kindly brought more when we ran out. My husband loved the tuna, I ate the spinach that came on the side which was very very good.For dessert we had the nutella sandwich, perfect ending to great dinner. We will definitely be back sooner rather then later."
3039,brought my girlfriend there last week and as expected it was filled with people. Love the conecept of the place... Food was ok.. a large selection of wines. The service is terrible. Our server never checked up on us even though he knew it was our first time there. needless to say we wont be back and that the server didnt get a good tip. I would rather spend my money somewhere else.
3040,"The food and the location were great. I would recommend everythng we ate, especially the milk-braised pork shoulder. My only complaint was how loud it was. We were stuck in the back corner and I was at the head of the table there were two people on each side. I could not hear anything that my friends were saying. It was a Wednesday night at 6:00pm and it seemed too early to be that lound. Everything else was great."
3041,"The food was all great, but when the bill came it wasn't worth all that. I eat out all the time, so am accustomed to high downtown prices, but this was a little steep for small bites. Save for a special occassion or expense account!"
3042,"We went here for brunch - so was the place was kinda quiet and we had the total attention of the host. The food is good but I wouldn't call it amazing. The marrow dish was soupy and the ears weren't amazing. They had a good wine selection. Overall, it was decent but verrry pricey."
3043,"Since I'm a huge pork lover this place was very satisfying. Everything was seasoned well. It was very crowded at the time so i was a it annoyed at the service, but the food made up for it. If you live in the River North/Gold Coast area, its a great walk."
3044,"I know that what I am about to write has all been said already, about this gem of a foodie heaven... But I feel like I need to express my heart felt feelings for my [gushing] NEW LOVE.... ohhh purple pig, I want to scribble your name all over my notebook like a blushing school girl.... I am often in Chicago for business, so try hard to get a taste of the dining scene as much as possible. .. I heard about this semi new place last week when I landed, and I had tunnel vison about coming to try it...I finally got the chance on a Sunday for lunch. The look right away made me like I was going to love the place... communal tables, wine barrels, & pigs everywhere. The bar had hand painted looking pottery with forks, knives and spoons in them, which added to the home feel. When I looked at the menu, I was slightly disappointed that some of the items from the on line menu, were not present. I was looking forward to sheep's milk ricotta with gravy. What we did order was the sardines, bone marrow, quail, cheese platter, pigs ears, & baby artichokes. Everything was to die for, I wanted to order more but honestly was so full I couldn't even eat past the pain. Though I do like the pigs ears from Michael's genuine food & drink in Miami better...I also now have a new love for La rossa, Italian beer.On my second visit ( one day later! ha) I only went for some drinks at the bar.. I decided now might be the only time I actually would have room for dessert.I decided on the panni that had nutella, marshmallow, and banana. My first bite immediately transported me back to my childhood... I'm 9 years old and my grandmother just made me a peanut butter, banana, and fluff sandwich.... ahhhh good times.Anyway, I hope to go to the purple pig at least two more times while I am in town... But after that purple pig.. I will only see you in my dreams..."
3045,"good food, casual, unique menu choices"
3046,"This place was a total let down from what I heard and was totally different than I thought it was going to be. Outside of being over the pork trend-factor, the food just wasn't that good. The staff was moderately friendly and the place is impossible to get to.I won't be back."
3047,Stopped in for a snack and this was just what the doctor ordered. I had the lengua and my wife got the salami plate. There were tons of excellent wines to choose from and a wide-ranging charcuterie menu from the sopressata to the lengua. We'll definitely be going back for more.
3048,"It's all good. But $4 for the almonds fried in pig fat, with rosemary and garlic? Divine."
3049,"My wife and i went for an early dinner on a weds. night. The place is a little on the small side and IT WAS PACKED!!!! We were both shoulder to shoulder with the people on either side of us. Oh well, that's not their fault. I had the almonds sauteed in pork fat...not sure how that sounds but it tasted amazing. The milk braised pork shoulder was just ok. It didnt live up to the hype. I really want to go back and try other things on the menu. Oh and the wine selection is pretty good. I had a Spanish red which worked real well."
3050,"Buen ambiente y carta de vinos. Mi corte, la especialidad, estuvomsonre cocido,,pero acompaado de una ensalada exepcional.Muy recomendable experincia"
3051,"Food - small portions - think snack sizePrice - big price for small snackWait Staff - mehWait time - lousy - especially for middle of week early dinner. got put on wait list at 6pm, didn't get seated till 7:30, got appetizer at 8:10.Environment - meh... inside loud and noisy, outside - weather gods made up for the serviceRecommended for: go if you aren't hungry, and want to hang out"
3052,"Very popular place! I like the small portions, gave us chance t try a variety of dishes. Fun food."
3053,"Went on recommendation of hotel staff. One of my friends also saw it on food network. We let the waitress order all our food and pick our wine, and it was so delicious. Wish I lived in Chicago so I could go back. I recommend to anyone visiting. Very unique food with great atmosphere and friendly staff."
3054,The restauraunt is small but the food make up for the lack of space and the wait! The waitress got our order wrong but we ate it wanyway because everything on the menu is delicious!
3055,Loooooong wait times but worth it if it's your first time.
3056,"I enjoyed the Purple Pig. The hype may be a bit much, but well worth a visit indeed. The tourists are a little out of control at the Pig but try a late weeknight for the best results."
3057,"Very busy place so that was a good sign. my friend and I went on the waiting list that was supposed to be about 2-hour long. They had empty tables outside but apparently a private party had booked all of the patio and they couldn't sit others. but much to our delight, after just about 10 minutes we were given one of those empty tables as the party had ended. So far, so good.We both started with a cocktail. I did not like the taste of my cocktail and asked the waiter if he could change it and he quickly did that, no questions asked. We tried a few small plates: Greek salad was outstanding. Fresh with heriloom tomatoes and the dressing has lots of feta cheese in it. The fried eggplant parmesan balls were also outstanding. Tasted just like eggplant parmesans in the shape of a meatball. Tried the bone marrow spread that was served with some grilled brioche bread. The bread was very oily and felt heavy but the bone marrow was great. Also tried the Jamon Serrano and a spanish cheese served alongside some preserve (probably grape or raisin preserve) with toasted french bread and loved every bit of it. We also ordered their salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese topped with pistachios. It was delicious but I felt it was a bit heavy on goat cheese. For dessert, we shared a lemon pannacotta with candied pistachio and it was a lovely end to a great tapas style meal. Overall a great experience. We may go back tomorrow night."
3058,This place is delicious! Be patient as it will take a bit to get seated-it's worth it though! Yum!
3059,"It's a fast pace place where the quality is nowhere close to what I expected. I tried a few dishes like the clams with merguez, too oily and lacks the rustic part to a lamb sausage with mild cinnamon flavor. the scallops were not caramelized enough and the chickpeas were overcooked. The poached squid was average and needed salt, the pork chop a little tougher and dryer than expected. Wine list offers a bunch of wines by the glass. Overall, efficient service but nothing exceptional in terms of flavors"
3060,BEST WINE bar in the city! seriously!
3061,"Just a fun experience. Great food knowledgeable, friendly wait staff.Tapas style. A million wine choices. Highly recommended. Period."
3062,"Was just in Chicago on business and pleasure. My cuz drove up from Indy on Friday so we could spend time together in the big city and have a little girl time. We had no plan - just wanted a great meal, great wine, a great experience for a great price. The Purple Pig offered all that. When we arrived, the host staff told us they were on a two hour wait, but let us know that the bar was first come first serve. We staked out a place to wait and the hostess (with the long blond hair) alerted us when she noticed a couple was leaving. That's way more that most hosts would do - especially considering how busy they were! We swopped in, grabbed the two bar stools and spent the next four hours being wined and dined by one of the most charming servers ever - Ryan. Basically, he ordered our meal (we had a total of 5 dishes - all amazing) and told us what wine to drink with what and all was outstanding. Truly, one of the most memorable meals of my life! Thanks Purple Pig and crew!"
3063,One of my favorite places in the city! Love the cozy atmosphere and located in a fantastic locations. It's perfect for couples and friends get together. The Pork shoulder is amazing as well as the chorizo stuffed olives!
3064,"Such a fun restaurant! We were a little intimidated by the wait, but it was well worth it. Great menu, definitely try the cheese and wine. We ordered a little bit of everything for 2, and our bill was around 85."
3065,"Delicious!I came here with an omnivore friend who wasn't sure if they had a lot of vegetarian choices, so I was a little skeptical to begin with, but I was blown away.We shared this appetizer which was a portobella mushroom topped with literally the best soy beef I've ever had and some cheese. If that was the entire meal, I could have left very, very pleased, but there was even more goodness involved... A Tofu sandwich with incredibly flavorful and non-slimy tofu, beans, and other veggies (very filling and delicious) and these long, crispy plantain chips with this garlic sauce spread over them that I have yet to stop craving. If you haven't eaten here yet, you should.Not everything was perfect- It is a pretty small place (but cute, and they have a patio), and it took a while to get our food (there were a few people that were there waiting before we ordered), but the girls at the front were helpful and nice, and- as aforementioned- the food was incredible."
3066,"My friends told me about this joint and I am glad they did.Food is pretty good,fair portions,from what I can tell visiting other Cuban restaurants,pretty authentic.Great place for quick lunch.The restaurant is pretty small,forget about sitting down during the busy lunch hour.Get it to go!"
3067,"lechon sandwich is my fave!!!!!!!!! great flavors,the bread is delicious! most deff hooked on this sandwich! lol"
3068,I love this place. The food is outstanding but not overly-priced. Plus you will have fun eating here.
3069,I thought that the food was awesome and the staff was great. Will go back!
3070,"i really want to like this place but after my 3rd visit i decided NOT to come back again.This place looks really cool, small and cozy, you feel you are not in Chicago! Good food choices, BYOB is a plus, outdoor sitting.1st time I came here, the food was excellent but then I had to run in the bathroom for No 2. I have eaten to many places over my 28 years and this never happened to me before. I wasn't going to come back but the 2nd time I came here was with a group of friends that wanted to try this place. Whatever. 2nd time around, the sandwich I had was just ok, the goat cheese empanadas are the best here and the exotic drinks, the calamari was the most HORRIBLE calamari I ever tried in my life! And to top it off I paid nearly 40$ for something I didn't enjoy. Yeap, the food here is expensive! Also, this place doesn't even have a washroom for their costumers. isn't this illegal?There is no reason for me to come back here again."
3071,"90 Miles Cafe is a small little joint that really gives you a feel for that Cuban Experience when you walk right in, Salsa Music is pounding and they have pictures of all these famous Cuban Americans. Staff is Great Service is Fast! Its about 7 dollars for the Cuban Sandwich which is so awesome. You can eat this sandwich at anytime during the it really really is good ! Def pick up the Cuban Sandwich This place gets two thumbs up from me!"
3072,"I work in the area, and 90 Miles is one of my guilty pleasures. Media Noche is great, definitely try the Ropa Vieja too. Do not pass up their cafe con leche. Service takes forever and a day, but it's amazing and imo well worth it."
3073,"I love this place, JB I think you couldn't see the difference between a Roll Royce and a Yugo !!!"
3074,Great cubano and Vieja Roja
3075,"Let me preface by saying I had a short stint in NJ. The prices for the quality and quantity of food out there are jawdropping. The food here is pretty darn good tood, the only thing that is lacking is service. Yes, i know this is pretty much it when it comes down to Cuban food. That doesn't mean you have keep your nose so darn high. First time I stopped in I shook it off as the person behind the counter is having a bad day. Second time around got the same snippity attitude. If it wasn't because food is pretty good and I enjoy having different latin flavors besides mexican food I probably wouldn't be so kind."
3076,"I used to live across the street from this place, and I had no idea how spoiled I was! I miss it so much, especially being able to get the cafe con leche before going to work! It's great for any meal, they have amazing pastries, the sandwiches are great, my favorite was the cubano, and the dinners are great too! I still come here when I'm in the area, but I wish they would open one close to my new house!"
3077,Amazing Cuban food. Amazing Cuban coffee. Kind of small so I generally take everything to go.Thanks
3078,"It was incredible. The outside seating was perfect, our waiter Buck was so accomodating and everything he recommended was so wonderful!! The flavors in the food was great. The portion sizes was more than I anticipated and took a lot of it home. Just a wonderful experience all around and will definitely go back for more."
3079,food was great! by far the best cuban restaurant i've eaten at. waitresses we're ok in customer service if i had to rate my waitress i would probably give her 2 stars.
3080,atmosphere was great and in addition the food was great! although i had to wait an hour with my friends it was still a great place!! pretty good cuban food ! the food was a lot similar to one of my best friends mom back in LA ... her mom (cuban) was a great cook !!
3081,Absolutely amazing. I had the Epanandas and the whole red snapper. I sat on their outside seating area and sipped a refreshing limey drink that mad the hot day seem to melt away! Love it and highly recommend it.
3082,"I always enjoy a good cuban sandwich and this is my new favorite spot. I sat outside in the outdoor patio last week and enjoyed a great meal. The staff was very friendly and most important my sandwich tasted great!My one complaint, soda was served in a can. I won't knock any stars off because of it, but I wish they had fountain soda instead!I highly recommend this restaurant."
3083,"We have been going here since they opened on Clybourn. The food has been pretty good, the price is right and the location is convenient. This evening I ordered via their website and when I showed up to pick-up our dinner they had no record of the order...until they looked at the printer under the cash register. Upon finding the missing order they proclaimed that the their website 'sucks' and I should phone my order and never use the online system and besides they were out of the grouper soup and did not have the chicken tamal that was on our printed order. Basically I was being told that their service failure was my fault for ordering online and ordering two items they were out of...very nice...wtf? They are always out of the grouper soup and should take it off of the menu. The two sides of black beans we received were 85% juice and they also left out the extra side of rice that we ordered. Very disappointed with the service and the quality of food."
3084,Excellent lechon! Good Cuban food! I'll be back.
3085,"This is a good place for a variety of Cuban sandwiches. In addition, the Tostones were almost as big as a DVD and very tasty! The only downside is the limited seating. If you want a table, go on a warm day and sit outside."
3086,"great cubano sandwich. I had the media noche (sweet bread), fried yucca w/ garlic topping. For dessert I had bread pudding and a cafe con leche. it was all terrific! homemade and delicious. would recommend. only drawback was that it was small inside but cozy. felt like i was in cuba for 30min. parking too!"
3087,Excellent mix of cuisine. Relaxing place. Especially in summer.
3088,"I'm a Puerto Rican from New York. Born in Puerto Rico. Aside from Puerto Rican food which is similar, I've had good and bad Cuban food and I most say that 90 Miles Cuban Cafe has some of the best Cuban food I've ever had. I had a Cuban sandwich with fried Yuca. My girlfriend also had the Cuban with tostones. I don't add many bookmarks but this one is a must for future visits to Chicago!!! If your expecting a full blown restaurant with a waiter/waitress this isn't it. But if your are looking for outstanding Cuban food and can get over what you may normally expect, then this is it! Unlike other reviews, my service was good. As I sat outside and enjoyed the weather and my food, the locals were non-stop stopping for carry out. A clear indication on how good the food is. The other important fact to point out is that if your a person that normally seasons food with just salt and pepper, your taste buds may not know how to act when you taste well seasoned Cuban food. So if your taste buds don't agree, it's not the food. So don't be fast to blame the food and accept that maybe you just haven't had authentic Cuban food!!! One more thing, don't judge this neighborhood treasure by the size of the building. Great things come in small packages!!!!"
3089,"My take out order was messed up so that was not a good start. I had to make my own rice since they forgot to put it in. I might as well have cooked the whole meal. The ropa vieja and frijoles negros were kind of tasteless. Too many Latin places I've been to in Chicago leave out the authentic ingredients and spices and everything comes out tasting just plain salty and one dimensional. This is one of them. I don't get all the hyped up reviews - either they come from people too far removed from the real thing and what it's supposed to taste like or they're friends of the house. Sorry, but not worth it."
3090,"LOVE this place! It is very authentic to the little cuban eateries in Miami. I ony wish they had an avocado salad! Love the black beans and rice, great tostones, cuban bread authentic.....so good!"
3091,I have eaten at the location on Clybourn several times. The steak sandwich is good but a bit expensive if you drive a little farther west up Belmont to Cicero (Amira;s Trio)and make a left you will find the food better tasting and cheaper priced. Otherwise 90 miles is good if your in their area
3092,"Loved it!!! Went to 90 Miles on Clybourn with me foodie partner & son Steve & was very impressed. We shared 1 cuban & 1 bistec sandwich & ordered the mariquitas (plantain chips) and headed outside to eat...what a nice surprise we got with every bite. We have never been to Miami for a cuban but we know what we like & we liked it all. I remember the nasty hotdog stand that used to be in that location so my expectations were not all that high but I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience, the service was a 10, the food was a 10 & the outside cafe was a 10 as well. I would suggest you get the garlic sauce that they serve with the plantain chips on the side because it is a bit much when put directly on the chips but other then that a perfect 10!!"
3093,"Definitely the most authentic Cuban food in Chicago. All the dishes are very authentic and does feel like mi abuela made them. I didn't try the sandwiches, but the dinners were nice. Black beans were not the best I've had in Chicago, but all the sides, like Yuca, Tostones, Maduros, and Croquetas were spot on. Steak was ok - your typical pounded Cuban steak, Lechon was the strongest dinner dish. Bread pudding was outstanding. The milkshakes are ok - a little more creamy than fruity. I can see why everyone likes the owner, he's pretty nice, and gave out Cuban coffee to everyone. A nice touch. There is a sort of weird Cuban or want to be Cuban groupie thing going on there, but its fine if you don't know what I'm talking about. =)"
3094,"The empandas were so delicious (creamy goat cheese, and goat cheese/guava served with an oil/cilantro concoction). And the veggie dinner plate was solid, with surprisingly flavorful grilled veggies. But maybe I wasn't in the mood that night for a veggie dinner plate; I can't help but feel like maybe i missed the boat and should have gotten a sandwich instead."
3095,"Well let me start off by saying that I have eaten cuban food before and i was shocked to taste such great cuban food in Chicago, the atmosphere was electric, cuban music playing and the hottest husband wife couple dancing behind the register so i dont know what was better but i know that if you havent been there go asap its like going to a show without the price tag, it is my new favorite place you will see what i meen when you go"
3096,"Love, love, love this place! It's right next door to my vet's office so when we bring the puppy there we stop at 90 Miles Cafe. The food is so good, especially the guava and cream cheese pastry! Not to mention the food is inexpensive. Get the papas fritas too!The owner is such a nice guy, everyone seems to be having a great time, and you can't help but shake it to the music while you're waiting for your food! I will definitely be making the trip"
3097,"Wow, I just moved to Chicago from Miami and I was having a hard time finding a good cuban restaurant. Last week, however, I was on the bus reading the RED EYE and there it was, 90 Miles! I gathered a few friends to introduce them to my native cuisine. The moment we walked in we were greeted by the owner Alberto, pouring Cuban Cafe to any body that reached for it. I must say, the experience that followed was amazing. The lechon was season to perfection and trust me I know; it is my favorite dish! I felt like I was back in Miami but only cooler. As for my friend, I suggested for them to have the Cubano, Ropa Vieja, and the steak sandwich, we also ordered empanadas and tamales cubanos. This place is what Cuban food and hospitality is all about!!! Great job 90Miles!!"
3098,"If you like cuban, you need to stop in for a lechon and a cafe. the guanabana shake was amazing. on my drive home... will definitely be taking out often. ^^"
3099,"love it love it love it! great service! awsome envoirnment good prices! i can't get sick of it. if you can't find what you want to eat here, your tastebuds done broke."
3100,"Really, this place is solid. I highly recommend the Lechon (pulled pork, plaintain, onion), the empanadas, and the cafe con leche. The staff are great and you should listen to their recommendations. When are you guys going to take credit cards so that I can order take out for the family without running to the ATM?Update - Arturo the owner just sent a note that they are accepting cards."
3101,Wonderful ! I really enjoyed the quaint-ness. The food was good and affordable. I love the cafe style of it. The menu is quick and the staff was super nice.
3102,"I work around the corner from this place and had to try it for lunch. I ordered the steak sandwich, and it was well worth the wait. I ordered in, and sat at their bar stools that line the wall at one end of the place. The seating is what it is. I'd only recommend it if its just you, or one other friend. I really see this place taking of as a great take-out place for the area, and hope their outdoor seating gets well used in the evenings for the dine in dinner crowd. Some umbrellas or a canopy and BYOB proudly displayed would get that ball rolling."
3103,Food was awesome and the atmosphere was authentic I thought minus the cold weather. Parking lot was a bit tight but over all it was a great experience!
3104,"I have been looking for a good cuban sandwich shop ever since living in Boston and frequenting a cuban sandwich stand. Finally, I have found it! Their sandwiches are full of flavor and filling, and their yucca chips are delicious. I would highly recommend for a quick lunch!"
3105,"Go immediately and get the Guajirito: steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on flattened green plaintains (instead of bread). I'm a veg, and they were happy to substitute grilled portobello mushroom for steak, but I've no doubt it's amazing with the steak. The soup was no hot enough, but was very good. Wife had the tofu sandwich, which also had grilled red peppers and black beans, and a cheese empanada, which I tried and was excellent. Very cool space that has been decorated very well. Also recommend the hot sauce. They serve several types of coffee drinks, too, with a cuban twist. Didn't try those today, but will asap. Also great cuban music playing."
3106,the cuban sandwich and yuka was incredable. great atmosphere and service nice decor and music must go....
3107,"Enjoybale cubano. Made correctly, good size, served hot and juicy, and on better bread than most. I will say I've had better though at a better price. I also tried the pollo sandwich. Not so great. Very dry and processed. Could have made this at home. The yucca fries were, well, yukka. Perhaps if they'd been hot?I think this place could use a little quality control."
3108,I eat here for lunch as much as possible 3-4 times a week i love the steak sandwich and the empanadas are great!!!!
3109,"I really love this place. Its real, its authentic and most of all its intimate."
3110,awesome great place! love there empanadas! i recommend them!!! rice and black beans!! yum yum yum!
3111,"Alright, so I was definitely pretty stoked about trying this place out. It wasn't a let down, per se, but it didn't overly wow me as some others have written.The staff was super friendly - definitely a very chill vibe, they helped with our order and even gave us some recommendations. Pretty cool and much appreciated.The food was stellar - I ordered the Cubano, although I expected it to be much bigger...they definitely hired some good photographers for their website, as the pics don't really accurately reflect what you get.With that said it was definitely solid, very tasty. I also ordered the goat cheese empanada, which I'd recommend in a heartbeat (I can't see how you could mess up a pastry filled with goat cheese...).Quick note though on the shakes that everyone raves about....I definitely saw this dude load up five HUGE spoonfulls of sugar into the shake...like massive scoops. So, if you're wondering why they are so good, I'd say just know that those things are really, really not good for you. You wouldn't normally consumer that much sugar in a week, I'd guess. Pretty absurd and probably over the top.So all in all I'd say check it out - but don't go in with expectations that you're going to embark on a spirtual journey of tastiness."
3112,"after reading all of the yelp comments about this place, I decided to try it. I must start off by saying that I lived in Miami for many, many years before moving to Chicago, so I'm used to having very good Cuban food. That said, this was just OK. The chicken was not as tender or well-seasoned as I would have liked. The maduros (sweet plaintains) were OK, but nothing to write home about. I also had the guava pastry. It was nice and flaky, but a little hard. Compared to what i'm used to, this was edible, but definitely not top notch."
3113,90 miles' lechon sandwich and goat cheese empanada are two of the best things to happen to me since moving to Chicago.
3114,"both 90 mile locations are really good. the beans and rice are so savory, that you could just eat them as a meal, but then you'd miss out on the delicious ropa vieja or bistec and plantains. unlike many cuban places, there are quite a few great vegetarian options, i like the tofu and i love the vegetable empanada. yuca frita is also good and nothing is too heavy or greasy. great food, great prices."
3115,These guys are the real deal! Sandwiches are the killer and can't go wrong with any one of them. I do want to try their coffee one of these days also.
3116,"Great Cuban sandwich and maduros! Cute place, excellent takeout service. Looking forward to trying more on the menu on our next trip."
3117,"After reading the reviews I had to try this place. Once I did, I realized previous reviewers were correct. Wonderful food for a very very low price, traditional Cuban foods, and lets not forget the fruit shakes. I gotta say though my favorite was the steak dinner."
3118,This place is addicting. The sandwich that is made out of plantains instead of bread.The Best
3119,"Great cuban food. Great staff and very efficient customer service. I'm a stickler for good food and how well the wait staff treat the customer, Bigger deal is how the managers treat their staff, Makes for a very relaxing and respectful place. Highly recommend,"
3120,"This place rocks!Cheap, great food. And close to the pad.Thank You 6 lb baby Jesus"
3121,Wow they have so many reviews they just open about a year ago. The food is awesome though. I remember knocking on the window and asking them when were they gonna open. Operated by a beautiful husband and wife team (sometimes their at the register). I love their cuban sandwiches. I always get the bistec sandwich with the little fried chips on th side. They also do smoothies. Outdoor seating is available small inside; but the delicious food make up for it. Great hospitality. You guys are gonna need a bigger space.
3122,"Finally made it here after all the hype and talk only to be blah! I didnt think it was nothing special. typical lettuce and tomato type of sandwich on french bread. Nice cool decor. ok place but there are better Cafe's in Logan Square. I try them again some other time, maybe it was just an off sandwich."
3123,"This place is just wonderful!We go here when we want a nice cocktail time, everyone has their own little place. Good music, great ambiance. They have a very good selection of different kind of drinks too!If you want a cocktail place that is isnt the usual, definitely recommend this place!"
3124,"This is my favorite bar in the entire world. Sure, the Speakeasy theme is becoming somewhat mainstream and played out, but the Violet Hour delivers in every way.After entering through a non-descript door covered in graffiti you enter a dark, bar only lit by candlelight. The decor is very well put tother and the bar itself is beautiful. If my memory serves me correctly, it was a white marble, which was gorgoes, and lined with large comfortable seats. On the other side, a knowledgeable bartender with plenty of spirits to satisfy the most picky drinker.Usually, I sit at the bar and the staff has been exceptional. Order a drink from their list, or just tell the barman what flavors you are looking for and they will put together a well crafted cocktail that seems to not exist and most bars.If wish I could give my favorite bar more than 5 stars. The Violet Hour is exceptional."
3125,I visited this place recently due to really great reviews from my friends. The ambience can be described as a subdued elegance and I really enjoyed the intimate feel you get as soon as you walk inside. I had the plumb & sour cocktail which to my delight was absolutely perfect. The cheese plate I had left a little to be desired because it really didn't present anything extraordinary. Otherwise my experience was great and I would definitely come back again.
3126,"Can anyone say pretentious? Once we were inside, the experience was fine but the line experience was a little much. It would be one thing if you had to wait in line and people were seated in the order that they arrived. But it seemed like if you were in with the door guy, then you got to go in front of everyone else. I mean who is this establishment kidding. This is Chicago - lighten the fuck up!"
3127,"Easily the most romantic and special date I've been on. This is someplace you go for a special occasion in my opinion, probably not your average going out night. A very helpful staff and the absolute best cccktails I've ever had!"
3128,This place started the entire lounge/hand-crafted cocktail experience and it STILL is the best! From the speakeasy feel of the place to the staff and the amazingly refined drinks---it does it all right! Worth the wait if you have to wait as the experience is one you will never forget. Every time I have gone here I have been pleasantly surprised by how much the place continues to charm me and never gets old.
3129,"They have the best cocktails in the city, hands down. I am entertained by the prohibition theme and the dcor inside is gorgeous. I've been going there for years and they even make drinks that are off the menu now, you just have to ask. It's just an out there place that's hard to describe, but certainly worth trying. The only downside is the wait."
3130,BEST place in Chicago for drinks.
3131,This is the exact reason I do not go to Chicago bars!! Way to stuffy for me!! Not going to try and be someone I am not. Being made to feel comfortable and welcome in your surroundings is very important so this is not the place to be made to feel comfortable. I really do get what they are trying to do but it's to extreme. To snobbish for me.
3132,"This place is great. It reminds me of the east coast and the drinks are amazing. Great atmosphere, not too loud for talking."
3133,Great.....just great! No further comment...go and see for yourself!
3134,"Violet Hour is me and my wifes favorite place in the city. We've been going there regularly the last year. The ambience is great, all of the staff is very very nice and friendly, and the cocktails are just fantastic."
3135,"Go to this place at least once. Amazing drinks, really neat atmosphere."
3136,"Room to move. Pretty, thoughful drinks. An elegant night. Thank you."
3137,"While visiting Chicago recently, a friend and I decided to meet some people at the Violet Hour. I noticed a set of rules posted at the entry, and thought that the place was a little.. pretentious. Still, we decided to give the Violet Hour a chance. I see that some reviewers have complained about a lengthy wait, but we were seated with our friends after just a few minutes in line.We were seated in the back near a fireplace, and I did like the decor. But everything was too dark and too quiet. It definitely didn't seem like the place to go for fun on my last night in Chicago. After waiting around 20 minutes for a waiter, I chose a cocktail called Goya's Cous de Gras. It was definitely worth the $12, BUT not worth the $12 and the 30 minute wait to actually get my drink. By the time my friend and I finished our cocktails, we asked for our check and started saying our goodbyes to the rest of our friends. We had to wait another 20-30 minutes just to get the check.In a nutshell, I think the Violet Hour could be the place for an intimate get together of a few friends who have the entire night to sit around and drink expensive cocktails. If you want to have FUN.. like, rip-roaring, dancing and drinking fun, the Violet Hour is no good. Clearly, this place just wasn't for me."
3138,"Don't get the big hype?? Appetizers and drinks were ok, but nothing to rave about."
3139,"Great Atmosphere. Even the mocktails (non-alcoholic) were great! Got a drink with Honey, Cinnamon, and Club Soda/Lemon it was great! Worth the wait. Definitely pass by."
3140,"I'll just cut to the tl;dr part. Great cocktails. Great bartenders.Too dark. Too fussy. Too expensive. And, perhaps, too impressed with itself."
3141,Absolutely Loved it. Very different experience from anything else I've been to in Chicago. The food is fantastic and the drinks are very well thought out. We actually left our table in order to go see our drinks be made. I would say that is a must. The mix-ologist/ bar-tenders know exactly what they are doing and they put great detail into every drink. It's almost like you are on vacation and you are getting special treatment because you are a special guest. My eyes took a little time getting use to the light because it is all candle lit. The candle light just helps make Violet hour more unique and brilliant. I love telling people about my experience there and that's the type of place you want to visit. I've never been more impressed as I was at Violet hour. I love trying new things and I appreciate places that are different from the norm.
3142,"Having just had a great time with friends here last night, I felt the need to share how wonderful this place is. Last night was a typically great night at The Violet Hour. The hostess for the night did our routine ID checks and when she saw mine, she wished me a happy b-lated bday. Then, I remembered how I should have reviewed the night of my 30th birthday on Saturday Dec. 18th at this wonderful establishment:I showed up early as I had been here before and knew I had to be here at open if I had a chance of sitting in the back area with a decent sized group. I showed up with 10 people and with 6 more on the way to meet me. The hostess for the night was completely amazing. She offered to split our group and knowing this was a special night she made sure all my friends knew where I was seated so I could greet them when they came in. I had 16 people in my party and I was able to mingle and catch up with everyone. The hostess came back to make sure my whole party was seated and asked before she removed one of the seating stools from one of the tables that wasn't being used. Then made sure there wasn't anything else I needed. She was completely friendly, accommodating and professional. The waitress for our table was amazing at describing drinks for the newbies and recommending drinks for the ones that had been here before. SUPERB SERVICE.Everyone left thoroughly impressed with the atmosphere, service and quality of drinks/food. I made sure to thank the hostess of the end of the night for the wonderful experience (I wish I remembered her name!). I was one happy birthday girl. Thank you Violet Hour."
3143,"I took a friend of mine to the Violet Hour on my sister's recommendation, and I'm so glad we went! The Violet Hour serves fantastic drinks and great small plate food. The atmosphere is completely original yet completely welcoming. You need to take a friend, wear a snazzy outfit, and go enjoy The Violet Hour!"
3144,"Aside from the exclusive and pretentious nature of the place, I absolutely love my experiences here. Never attempt to get in with an odd number of people. It's perfect for dates--very intimate, perfectly dim lighting, tall drapes everywhere, no windows, tall cozy chairs. The drinks are all deliciously prepared with the finest liquors and homemade mixers. I was unimpressed by the selections of cheeses, so I've only had the beer nuts to eat here, but they were excellent. All in all, a great place to cocktail."
3145,"I really adore the enviornment-- high backed chairs that make you feel royal, and super dark lighting where you have to hunch over a candle. The drinks are amazing. The seating somehow feels really private and intimate, especially if you love the dark. But definitely go on a weeknight-- because swarms of people will spoil the serenity."
3146,"Violet Hour experience # 1 : we'll do this bullet-point fashion...1-the ambience is simple, classic and nice. yes, very ny like, and the age ranges from mid twenties to upper fifties--which I thought was an interesting mix, in a positive way!2-do not attend this place if you're hungry, or anticipating a great eatery. Their sustenance menu could be better perfected--do NOT order the mini hot dogs or chicken wings, better elsewhere. The best : potato tater tots. Sort of a random mix menu...3-The wait actually isn't too bad. It's all a little hyped up, to be quite honest, as if you're walking into an exclusive club. They were very understaffed for Sat. night, but kind and unpretentious.Overall, would I go back? Maybe...if someone else in my party was itching to go. Would I recommend this place? Sure, if you want a nice sit down, wine/conversational setting. It's not loud, rather quiet and simplistic set-up. I would NOT order appetizers again, and just drink their Malbec hence, I attend again--not satisfied, but not ecstatic...it was mediocre, and a lot of hype."
3147,"Such a cool spot. The cocktails are top notch, even if they are a bit expesnive, you are paying for the experience.I wish my hometown had a prohibition bar like this. Everytime I visit Chicago (which is once or twice a year) I have to go to the Violet Hour!"
3148,"I understand slow service when its slammed, but slow on off nights is stupid. That said, good spot. Kasey is best mixologist in city, by a long shot."
3149,"I've been to VH 5 or 6 times and there is a lot to like and dislike about it. Dislikes: It is really, really expensive. There is an obnoxiously long line. (On purpose. There are open tables.) It is a bit pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious. Very popular with the Crimson Lounge dirtball/ slimeball crew. Likes: The drinks are awesome. Very unique, well crafted, great ingredients. The decor is interesting and unique. VH definitely provides something different from most bars. If you're looking just to go get a good drink and hang out, I would skip Violet Hour. If you want to show some friends from out of town a cool spot try it out."
3150,The Violet Hour is unique. I could not bear to there very often but it can be alright once in a while. It's a great place to bring out of town visitors. I am not fan of waiting outside or in a dark hallway for hours. I know call me crazy. I really don't get why there is always such a long line of look-at-me's waiting outside a bar who's theme is not being seen. The drinks are really really good if you appreciate cocktail crafting. And anywhere they outlaw Grey Goose is fine by me.
3151,"Will frequent often for the drinks and the atmosphere. Other reviews speak for this place sufficiently, no need for me to elaborate any further."
3152,"Nice place, and very classy. I love the unusual decor and ambiance. I would also say the bar staff fit the decor of the restaurant, adding to its mysterious bordering creepy vibe. Bartender was great and cracked open the bear bottle with another bottle, a trick I would love to learn sometime. He was also pretty knowledgeable. The hostess was a little rude when seating us, but not a big deal. I was hungry but their menu was less then appetizing, with only about 10 or so items (half of which i did not even know what they were). My friend ordered something i can't remember what and did not like it. He was sick all night and funny enough was our DD (aka he was not drinking more then a beer). The place seemed a little uppity to me, but maybe it was just not for me. Over all service was good, ambiance was creditable but not friendly, the food was bad, and the drinks where expensive."
3153,"Cute. It's classy and defiantly attracts a higher-end crowd which is fun. Drinks take a while to come and service is usually slower but extremely knowledgeable! I ask to be surprised with something made with Tequila and am never disappointed with a drink that has over 7 ingredients in it. Bartenders know their trade and the atmosphere is whimsical and refreshing. Also like the list of rules as it keeps all the annoying people off their cell phones, drunks to find a different bar, and trashy people to stay at bay. Dress nice and have a drink in mind other than a light beer or shot."
3154,"The stars were raining magic upon the quaint faade of a hidden map that alluded my new candy-eyed boy and a confused cab driver all looking for our destination: enchantment at the Violet Hour.After all of this time, where have you been all my life sweet illustriousness ubiquitous hub of de-lishnus, oh sweet Violet Hour?No, but seriously, it was really raining when we came. Cats and dogs and sheeps and cattles, if you catch my drift lol. But that's Chicago for you. Never a dull moment in this windy city. Luckily, my candy-eyed boy thought to bring an umbrella. He's not usually a thinking man.... Upon the heavenly cessation of our bumpy cab ride, we arrived at the knowers-only entrance gala to the Valhalla of fancy drinks. The wait was unbearable. But after a glance at the supernaturally calm and cool doorguy, and I knew this was a place I had to be inside.Alot of you other yelpers have described this place as Alice-In-Wonderlandish, but I must confess unduly that you are all completely and catastrophically wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only way to really describe this place is as if Xanadu met an Eyes Wide Shut fantasy and in the darkness, all the glitz and glamour were sexily studded in diamonds. And then, the diamonds were studded in sex, because this place is SEX-EE!It's dark, dim, and hard to see at first. But once me and the boy were straddled in candlelight; our faces were basked in the golden beauty of eras bygone and a style of drinking, prohibtionarily; lost to the ages! We probably both looked a lot more beautiful for it.Even our waitress Grace looked like a Renaissance painting. AmAAAAAAAzing Grace. She told me about a special OFF-MENU drink called a Vodka Pie. It was awesome! Like, biblically awesome! I couldn't have told you what was in it, but whatever. My drink tasted like unicorn tears; literally, like unicorn tears. I cried too.And, I looked up at the ceiling and I could literally see the stars. My eyes transfixed, my fingers traced the outline of Cassiopeia. Literally, I did. Maybe there was absinthe in my drink and I was tracing the green fairy to the golden heavens of intoxication. My date let loose with a few Blackberry something-or-others that were pretty to die for too. The lime juice was like jungle passion. It was all like a rutti-tutti-fresh-and-fruity slap in the face of Epicurean ecstasy. One thing, whenever the boy smiled, he had seeds in his teeth. Hello, ever heard something about a strainer? Just kidding, I'm sure that's part of the experience! lol, lmao.Really, the only downside of the evening besides paying the bill to leave was that those drinks were strong. Hey, I've had my fair share of kir royales in my day, but things got spinny. And the boys tongue got a little loose. I really don't need to hear about your ex-girlfriend's fetishes while you're whispering in my ear. And when I went to the bathroom to cry, I couldn't find it. Kind of embarrassing in a really swank-i-fied establishment, but I was drunk enough not to care. All in all, a magical experience!!!!"
3155,"I am willing to put my vote in that the Violet Hour is one of the very best bars in the country, if not the best.I have long been a fan of the bar, and followed the bartenders' methods and formulas for crafting drinks. Everything on the menu is solid; there is a perfect drink for everyone, and for every season. Having some of the best cocktails in the country isn't the very best part about the Violet Hour. What makes it the best bar in Chicago is how it set the trend for all of the great bars to come along since, and led the cultural revolution that is craft cocktails in Chicago. The Kold-Draft ice you see in any establishment that wishes to be taken seriously, the fresh juices, homemade syrups and bitters, these are all thanks to the Violet Hour.My most recent visit was just as phenomenal as all the others, but rather than talk all about every drink that I enjoyed, I'm writing this review to call out a lot of idiotic ideas that turn up in countless yelp reviews:-Stop complaining about the ice: Anyone who thinks the large chunk of ice in their Old Fashioned is taking up all the space, and leaving them with less booze is a moron. That's not how surface area and volume work. Cheap, crappy ice is designed to fill your glass more efficiently, taking up more space, meanwhile turning your cocktail into a watered down mess. That big ball of ice in your drink is your best friend.-The drinks are not over-priced. Granted, not every night is $12 cocktail night for every person. We all have our priorities. However, when you are looking for a good cocktail, $12 is a damn fair price. Considering all of the care and work that goes into using fresh, homemade ingredients and fine spirits, you are drinking creations that could easily go for $20. When you can go to a high-end restaurant and still pay $8-9 for nothing but lame flavored vodka drinks, why is $12 considered pricey for some of the best stuff on earth? New bars are already starting to charge $13, or more on their cocktail menu. 12 is nothing to complain about.All in all, for people who like a really good drink, there is no place better than this. This is a force for cultural good in Chicago, and the entire country."
3156,"Okay, I'll start with saying that I'm a cocktail snob, appetizer fiend and and desperately crave originality. That said, The Violet Hour has become one of my favorite places in this City.They had me at the lack of front window (or any other sign of existence beyond a single light bulb and knowledge that it was there before hand. I won't go over every detail about this spot (got to see for yourself) however, I will say... GET the fried peanut butter and banana sandwich and anything with gin in it. Oh yeah Absinthe. The real way man.GO!"
3157,"holiday weekend w/the family took mom for a cocktail, seriously the rudest/insecure bartender in the city, it's the bearded guy and stay away, girl w/ponytail rocks, makes great drinks and friendly. The dude has a real problem. When was the last time you acutually told a 69 yr old lady to f off because you (the bartender) were inept. Way to go dude, hope you feel like a man"
3158,"I cannot figure out why they make people wait outside for at least a half hour when it's 30 degrees outside. Does it really take that much time to make a list? But that's the kind of establishment this is, overly pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious. No rhyme or reason to any of it. They ignore empty drinks, the waitstaff and bartenders get angry if you waste their time by asking about the drinks, and it is just generally unwelcoming. When we left, the bouncer/host was standing at his booth, seemingly doing nothing. I exited to see the long long line of people waiting to get their name on a list. Seriously, why do they make people wait outside just to make a list? Maybe it's funny to have a long line of people standing at a blank wall on Damen, only to turn them away.Yes, the drinks are excellent, the lighting is great, the privacy is nice, but they treat customers (both inside and those waiting outside) like they don't need them, or care if they are there."
3159,"Great drinks!, hate the wait."
3160,"Yes, drinks are expensive. Yes, there is ALWAYS a line. YES THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Their drinks are out of this world. What a great date spot, GNO spot, pre-game or after hours spot. I love it here. Friendly staff and great decor as well."
3161,"Our Journey starts on a plane from Seattle, and could have very well ended at Violet Hour and I would have been happy. Finding the place was just the beginning of what added to the mystique in my mind. Marked only by a light and a door handle, the door almost eluded us. After passing through the large velvet curtains I felt transported. The tall blue booths, lovely marble bar counter, and a back bar full of the herbacious liquids I so desire...Violet Hour was nothing short of my idea of heaven. We came in from Seattle to celebrate my birthday...and the drinks I got there were the perfect dessert. I was in on Oct. 29th, and Thursday night, and it wasn't very busy. The bartender was fantastic, and made me a delicious negroni type cocktail and a mouth watering Manhatten. When I come back to Chicago...I will be back at Violet Hour. Cheers"
3162,"love the concept, hate the place! I am sure the one in NY suits its neighborhood better! Overpriced. Under deserving of many stars. Good staff. Mike is an excellent bartender! I live down the street and have not had a desire to go back! Gimmicky in my opinion and trying just a little too hard. Maybe they could have gotten away with their theme and goals in Lincoln Park, but I am just so over overly pretentious people!!! We are breathe and defecate the same thing, so why must there be a set of rules prior to entering the place?!? Money is green regardless right?????? I shouldn't be complaining, because they treated me like royalty, but I just can't respect discrimination in any form, whether its covert or not and I really have a problem with their rules. The place isn't conducive to socializing either and if I am going to spend that much money, then I want to talk to at least do as I please!"
3163,I love Violet Hour. Fantastic drinks and sexy cool vibe. Defiantly date night spot!! Some advice though...these drinks are STRONG so a couple will do you nicely. Consider yourself warned.
3164,Great place to go for cocktails! Chic atmosphere and all around fun time
3165,"I love this place. Read a few negative reviews, and was a bit hesitant, but after going there, I can't figure out why people are complaining! The atmosphere is great, the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable and they mix up one heck of a drink! Amazing!"
3166,a little pricey but well worth it. i recommend you sit at the bar. havent tried the food. the drinks are tasty enough!
3167,"If I could give this less than one star, I would.This used to be my favorite bar in Chicago, but I'm sadly going to have to revise my review. After being faithful customers since the place opened, we actually got KICKED OUT. They claimed we'd been overserved, and that's the only explanation we got. We were left shocked and bewildered, with no clue as to what we'd actually done wrong. I'm not sure when they decided to define 2 rounds of drinks as overservice, but I don't care to ever go back if that's how they're treating loyal patrons. When I asked what we'd done to deserve such treatment, I was called combative (anyone who has ever met me will know that this is a laughably, absurdly inaccurate characterization).I'm not going to pretend the drinks aren't delicious, but as I've found it's pretty easy to take a run to the liquor store and make close approximations of them at home, for a lot less money, without mean people calling you names and kicking you out for no reason."
3168,"This place was lovely-- I only went there once with my whiskey loving cousin (we spent an hour sipping whiskey and talking about the flavors) but I would love to go back and try something a bit more adventurous. The interior is beautiful (and violet of course) the seats are set up in a very secluded way, and our waitress was very attentive. I love that there's no sign outside, and that the door is somewhat hidden-- it makes you feel like you've discovered something rare and almost like you're walking into another world. I can't wait to go back!"
3169,Simply perfect in every way. Very smart.
3170,"An endless fount of creative, delicious cocktails. I've never eaten the food here, we always just get a drink or two and soak up the scene. I have always found it completely mysterious that people will go to bars, pay the ripoff cocktail prices charged at many places, and stand because there aren't enough seats. Well hooray for the Violet Hour, I'd rather be kept out in the cold than let into a horribly uncomfortable environment and served a $10 drink by some inept bartender that shakes the gin, and have to stand in a drunken crowd whilst trying not to spill my overfilled cocktail glass of liquor so sorrowfully diluted by endless shaking.At the Violet Hour, you must have a seat, which is comfy, the noise level is perfect (the curtains help measurably with the acoustics) and the drinks are properly strong.My only complaint is that the drinks are overwhelmingly on the sweet side, though still delicious. This may be a nod to contemporary tastes, but I'd appreciate some drier options. Just because I look like a tart doesn't mean I like my drinks to taste like candy lol."
3171,"Worst experience ever. The bar was half empty yet we still waited for 30 minutes with a rude doorman. After being seated we waited another 25 minutes for a waitress to come and help us. She was was also rude and uninformative. 20 minutes and several complaints later she informed us that each drink takes 15 minutes to make. We left the establishment prior to recieving our drinks 1 hour after we arrived at a place that was NOT busy.I highly recommend you NOT go to this place unless you are looking for a night of bad service, rude pretentious people (without the class to back it up), and mediocre decor. TWO THUMBS DOWN."
3172,"We got on the wait list for a table on a friday night. They said they would call my phone in 45 minutes. We killed some time at the book store and music store around the corner, then walked back over. Of course there still was a wait, so another 20 minutes till we were seated.We enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks. I can see returning, but the whole line at the door issue is stupid. Later in the night, the booth across from us was left open for a good 15 minutes before 2 people were seated, and this is a huge booth that can be easily split up to two groups. Seeing this, I thought the line outside must be gone, but sure enough there were 15 people crammed in the hallway as we left.The doorman was nice to us and appeared to be doing everything he could to seat people fast, but obviously theres a few flaws in their system."
3173,This place is super cool! Parking is a bit hard to find but we got lucky and found a spot right on Damen about a block away......Actually the spot was hard to find also as there's no signs lights nothing.....it sorta looks like a abandoned factory from the outside with just the address in the front which caught my eye.....so we entered walked threw the 12 foot purple curtains made a right and walked threw another set 12 foot purple curtains and we are immediately greeted by a friendly host and then given our table with a set of very comfortable high chairs and 2 candles on each of our tables.....Dimmed lights and mellow nice music playing in the background....Pretty well set up with great decor.....Our waitress was also super sweet.....The menu was a little confusing because page after page just had the type of liquor...were its from.....and how old it is....not whats in it....lol....I had the Bula Mai Tai which was made pretty strong and had a stem of mint in it.....very tasty....my friend had the Vodka Cobbler....quite tasty....her second Cobbler was actually much better then her first as you were able to taste fresh strawberries in it.....This place is open till 2....good spot for one on one convo action.....great place in a great location....bucktown....
3174,"First of all, it's a little pretentious and pricey. It looks like a dive on the outside, it's kind of cold, and not a whole lot of smiles.BUT the drink menu is one of the most creative I have ever experienced. The decor is classic and beautiful. No cell phones, so turn it on vibrate.It's nice to see something like this in Chicago, it may not be for everyone but it is definitely unique."
3175,"i live in la....beverly hills to be exact...this place has something very very special about it....and someone said in there review pseudo-trendy, wannabe sunset, overly pretentious, well i would have to say most definenlty not! coming from la this was nothing to the sort..people in los angeles would flip out if they had something like this in there town...chicago...you have a diamond in the rough...enjoy it!!!!"
3176,"Wow. Well, we had an incredible night tonight. Given the weather outside this Sunday (ICE COLD), it took a lot to get us out. But a birthday for a friend deemed it necessary, so we did. And I am glad! Had dinner across the street at Francesca Fornos and then came here for cocktails. It rocked.We went in at about 7 pm, and even though it was freezing outside on a Sunday, the place was filling up...lively atmosphere, but seemed well-controlled by the kind woman at the door and the rest of the staff inside. We had no problem getting a seat, and spent a brief spell at the bar with a very cool guy (Kyle I think) who helped us with drinks to start while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The woman who sat us ended up being our server, Laura, and she was exceptional -- we were a bit intimidated by the menu at first, but she took plenty of time and care to help us with our choices, make suggestions for each of us, and answer any questions we had. Kept us happy for the (several!) hours we hung out, refilling water, bringing our food (try the Elvis -- yum!), and simultaneously manning many tables as the place filled up. I had three of the most amazing drinks I've ever had. Lady Grey was first and my favorite -- don't be scared by the egg white -- it's so good! Conclusion: I need to try the whole menu. I will be back and will be bringing new friends to show this place off to!!"
3177,Really like it here. Of course for the right occasion. Not the type of place to go to if you want to let your hair down though. Classy place to have a classic cocktail.
3178,"This place is for a certain mood. Great drinks, small private group. Its not vibey. Bring good conversation and your pocketbook."
3179,"so fun inside, or funny? interesting mix of modern minimalism, walks a fine line by beetleguese mansion! The drink I enjoyed was excellent, but I had not tried the other fair. Love no smoke no cell policy; its fun to smoke outside. Unfortunately the doorman needs some tips bout his job, at least it looks good intent and purpose. Both bartenders and waitresses make an excellent cocktail. May see a line of ugly people outside, but maybe thats just wicker park? I bet they all eventually are served, but why? Missed the back room on a weak weekday night, however, the mystery makes it even better. Is there a stage back there? do they grow wormwood?"
3180,"i love this place! the cocktails are so original. i thought the ice specific drinks were a bit pretentious at first, but after a chat and sample with the owner i realize my first inclination was completely wrong. also: the water is the best water ive ever had. i know its ridiculous. but honestly. best. water. ever. the interior is way chic, super speakeasy like. must try peanut-butter-banana-whatever-they're-called."
3181,amazing cocktails in a really cool space. the bartenders are really professional and the room is groovy!i love this place!!!
3182,"Violet hour is one of my favorite places in the city. Both times I have been was on as Sunday, so it wasn't too crowded. This is the type of place where you HAVE to sit at the bar. It's part of the experience to watch your cocktail come to life. The drinks here are some of the best I've ever had! Sit with Henry, he's great!"
3183,"I was visiting a friend in Chicago and she'd mentioned the Violet Hour as a place she absolutely loved, so I was excited to try it. We got there soon after it opened (it wasn't busy at all), dressed up, and sat at the bar, where after getting our drinks, we were thoroughly ignored for the rest of the time there. Our bartender, Henry, walked by us multiple times, purposely looking away, with our beverage glasses sitting empty. After about thirty minutes of this, we called him by name to get our bill, and took off. We have no idea why he acted this way, but were completely unimpressed. The drinks were fine, but the experience was ridiculous. I've never been treated that way in my life, and I'll never go back, nor recommend it to anyone I like."
3184,"great vibe.really great cocktails.really, really great staff.really, really, really fun menu!!!"
3185,"Carefully crafted drinks in a cozy, quiet, intimate atmosphere. The bartenders know what they're making, mixing ingredients (some home-made) to concoct the perfect cocktail. I love this place dearly. In my opinion, it's the perfect bar. The music is always good, the drinks and little foods are always good. The service is friendly (and many of the bartenders are enthusiastic about their creations) and chill."
3186,"Loved it! I went on a Friday at 6ish with a group of 8, we got a big booth to ourselves and had an excellent time. Decor-wise, I dug the big curtains and the tall chairs. Normally, $12 for a drink is excessive for my taste, but it was definitely worth it! Quality ingredients, strong, and delicious all around. Our server was very nice and had great recommendations."
3187,"The single star is because yes, this bar has awesom drinks and once you get inside the service is fairly good. However, both of those positives are almost entirely negated by the doorman and the inconsiderate way in which they treat their potential patrons prior to allowing them entrance (where they then charge approximately $15 per drink - which is fine in some places, but more than almost any other place in Chicago.) I have been several times and am always frustrated and a little insulted by the rudeness of the doorman (always the same guy.) Once we got in almost immediately, because one of my party gave him some money. Every other time, we have waited for over an hour. That is both ridiculous and inconsiderate for a place that refuses to take reservations and does not provide a comfortable waiting area. This past weekend I brought some friends from out of town, one a 30 year old from France. We waited for an hour, were called and then the doorman asked for our ids. My French friend (a 30 year old with facial hair and some gray) presented a valid French id. The doorman refused to accept it and would not let him in. They were with me for the entire weekend, we went to two clubs and multiple bars; the Violet Hour doorman was the only person to even question his id.Just as a side note, I am not someone who refuses to stand in line. I am more than willing to wait, or pay extra for bottle service, if it is the type of bar/club/restaurant where either is necessary. However, I expect to be treated well, and the Violet Hour (because of its doorman and the waiting area) completely fails in this respect. I cannot remember a single incident where I was ever treated as poorly as I was at the Violet Hour this weekend (primarily because of the doorman/waiting area). Frankly, lots of places have perfectly good drinks and I would rather go somewhere that doesn't treat its customers like crap.Needless to say I won't ever be going back."
3188,"If you've got a few hours to kill and some cash in hand, one hell of a retreat to nestle up in for the night and pretend you're Hemingway."
3189,"Not worth the hype. Its a nice romantic, dimly lit date spot. They make you wait and wait because they dont believe in standing. The drinks are strong but Im not too keen on the concept of drinking anything with raw eggs in it. They make alot of drinks with a raw egg meringue on top. I dont like how they wont allow anyone to stand around. As a former bartender I can see why its a place thats big with bartenders becasuse the drinks are strong and well made BUT you could get drinks as good elsewhere. And the high backed seats are uncomfortable and lack intimacy and discourage socialization with others."
3190,"We walked passed it few times. That is it's charm and decor inside. Drinks are really good, Sangria was made with some expensive wine, but fresh fruits and everything..... I would recommend this for a nice date..."
3191,"I just moved here from NYC baby so this is my first review of a Chicago place because I really liked it. THere was a line outside which is always a good sign to me . Once the ladies and I got inside it was great . Wonderful drinks , hot guys . I think I can learn to like Chicago ! Thanks for making me feel at home violet hour ;)"
3192,"I love the atmosphere in Violet hour, something seductive and velvety going on. it can get very crowded, too crowded sometimes, which at least for me, is too much at times. drinks are wonderful, not too pricey. great place, wish it wouldn't be that popular though."
3193,I recently went to Violet Hour with my husband the place has a great interior but the service was a little slow and the wait was a little long.
3194,"This place has a really cool atmosphere.The decor is totally modern, creative and chic. The chair backs are probably 6 feet tall and very trendy.The drinks are tasty and the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.Even though there was only a handfull of people inside, a line existed outside...I guess they want people to want to come in!"
3195,"Seriously, dont waste your time here....Unless, you like being treated like a 12 year old. 1st, my gf and I waited for an hour outside. We thought with all the hype it would be worth it. 2nd, the drinks are all $12 and they are not good. 3rd, they have a list of rules when you walk in. 4th, its extremely pretentious. We waited in a line outside, then waited inside behind a huge curtain, then had to wait behind another huge curtain before being seated. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE."
3196,Sophisticated & saucy drinks in a semi-secret speakeasy scene. Wear violet on Monday and your 2nd drink is on the house. Small bite food is the perfect pairing to the hand crafted drinks and makes sure that you don't end up drinking on an empty stomach if you decide to stay for one last round.
3197,"Hands down, favorite place in Chicago to grab delicious drinks and conversation."
3198,"I just wanted to say thanks to Maura (I hope I spelled it right) and everybody else who collaborated on Sun. night to make my first visit to the Violet Hour a super great one. I was in town visiting from Denver and have been wanting to go get a drink here for a long time. Unfortunately my friend and I arrived just a little too late and almost weren't allowed in, I whined about being there all the way from Colorado and luckily we got in. (Thank you floor manager & hostess for being cool). I started talking to Maura about bartending and drinks in general and she was so kind and made me a Juliet and Romeo. (even though we had originally been told it was too late for anything other than a beer and/or shot) Super delicious, I loved it. Wish I could be there more often to try out more drinks, this place is really quite lovely. I will be back as soon as I can! Here's to your continued success."
3199,The trick to keeping customers happy....keep those wine glasses full! violet hour did this quite well when I dined there with 65 colleagues last week. My wine glass was never once empty throughout the night!
3200,"The amazing cocktails are works of beauty. Hush and Wonder is my signature drink now, so much so that a bottle of Creme De Violette is my go-to hostess gift, thus ensuring a Hush and Wonder knockoff from those who know me well. Dark and Stormy is another favorite and inspired me to use more ginger in my own creations. Juliet and Romeo is a fail proof summer fling drink; relaxing, unusual, a hint of flowers and the comforting kick of gin. The phone free ambiance and spare sensual decor are well worth the visit, but once you've sipped these cocktails, you'll thank yourself for forging through the hipsters out there to the sanctuary inside."
3201,"Why do I love Violet Hour? Because it is like no where else I have ever been.Walking into the Violet Hour feels like walking into another time and place. They restrict the amount of people who enter so that everyone has a seat and it never gets too crowded. A policy that I adore.I went on a Friday night around 9:00pm, and so I had to wait about 45 min. There was also some minor confusion the night I went so I shall clear it up right here: You must give your name/cell number to the host at the front of the line. No matter what anyone else in line says.Once inside and seated you will notice the low lighting, gorgeous chandeliers and high backed chairs. The bartenders are dressed in traditional old-school bartender garb, which adds a posh air.On to the drinks: Amazing! All mixers are fresh and made on the premises. They pay attention to detail there, everything is presented beautifully.I have not yet tried the food, but from what I saw (and smelled) it is going to be delicious!If you are looking for a fun unique experience, you have to go to the Violet Hour!"
3202,"This is my favorite place to have a great drink in the entire city. I am not talking about a beer with friends but a great drink. That is what these guys do, they take their drinks seriously. Want an unbelievable cocktail with house made bitters, fresh ingredients and a staff that is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly? Come here. This place isn't for everyone and that is the point. That is why they don't have a sign outside. You come here to enjoy yourself, have amazing drinks, listen to great music and not have to worry about someone taking Facebook photos of themselves on their camera phone. I like dive bars, Milwaukee St. bars and I even like going to the bars/clubs on Rush/Diversey and River North. When I want a serious drink in a relaxed place though I come here. If you want an average drink in a regular bar go somewhere else. This is not the place to come with a large group of people (i.e. 6 or more.) It is a great place to take a first date or when you are looking to impress a girl. But make sure the other person can appreciate a good cocktail/whiskey/etc. If you are bringing a girl here who regularly drinks cosmos, is just out of college, or wears Uggs with sweatpants and big sunglasses, the whole experience will be lost on her. Treat the guys working the door the right way and you will have the time of your life. The drink prices are very reasonable for the quality you get! The average price is $12 and for the same price at a club/bar you'd get a watered down version with crap ingredients made by someone who doesn't really know how to make the drink. The finger food is really good and the menu changes with the season, I wish they would leave the peanut butter/bacon/banana sandwiches alone though. Luckily there is some great late night food nearby."
3203,I Love this place! I walked by this place a dozen times before i realized it was an actual bar/lounge. No windows and no sign but i think it makes it more interesting. The interior is amazing the drinks are equally amazing. I give it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey but i guess i understand why these are not your ordinary drinks you get anywhere. Great place to take a date.
3204,"PAY WITH CASH ONLY. OR ELSE YOU RISK BEING STOLEN FROM!!!I just opened my Bank of America home page. I was just doing routine budgeting. But I discovered, to my dismay, that VIOLET HOUR STOLE $17 from my bank account!!! You may not think this is a lot, and it's not, but when does it feel good to be robbed???? Here's what happened. My total bill came to $43 dollars. I gave a tip of $7. I paid with my debit card. When I looked in my account, I had a $43 dollar charge followed by a $24 dollar charge. This happened to me once before several years ago and I vowed never to use a card to pay a restaurant. But at some point that wasn't worth the hassle. Then came Violet Hour!Yes the lines are long. Yes the food is only okay. The atmosphere is not necessarily worth the wait. All of that is okay because my girlfriend really wanted to go to a speakeasy and the drinks are amazing. BUT THEY STOLE MONEY FROM ME!! IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO YOU, USE CASH ONLY. I am writing this even before calling Bank of America. As you can tell, I'm very upset. But I don't think that I'm being over the top. Hopefully my warning will save you 17 bucks. I guess that's the going rate for ripping people off these days (Madoff notwithstanding)."
3205,The atmosphere is cool but the service is slow.
3206,Very interesteing place. Has a unique atmosphere. Like the champagne drinks/coctails. The mini hotdogs are terrible but all in all I like the place. I'd go there again with a few friends. This is not a place for big groups or shooters...definitely.
3207,"Absolutely love this place! I'm going to keep this short and recomend that when you do go (and you should!) sit by the bar to watch how meticulously they make your drinks. Then enjoy sipping on your perfect little concoction, I reccomend the Romeo and Juliet!"
3208,after drinking here i will never be able to enjoy another cocktail as much. love love love love love love love love love love!!!!!
3209,First Impression: Dark and hip. Great place for up to 4 people to have cocktails. The high back chairs great a conversation nook. We had tried to come here during a previous visit to Chicago but the wait ended up being about 3.5 hours. We decided to come early (7ish) and this time we were successful.Drinks:Where to begin. I had the Blinker which was a perfect summer drink. Refreshing without being too sweet. It was so good I had it twice. In between this lovely cocktail I had the the Violet Hour Old Fashioned which was also great with its single large ice ball. My husband has a Sazerac for the first time and LOVE it. Next he had a Manhattan with chocolate bitters- the best one he ever had. He finished the evening with a gimblet. This was a lot of drinks.Food:We did not order food but the small menu seems like a perfect fit for the cocktails. Service:Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the bartenders make a perfect cocktail.
3210,"One of my favorite places in Chicago. There aren't too many bars that I would wait in line to get into, but this is one of them. I love the service, atmosphere and the cocktails."
3211,"LOVE this place! One of my favorite spots in Wicker Park. Yes, sometimes there's a wait. But the service is mostly excellent +the drinks are not only delicious, but strong."
3212,"If ANYTHING about this establishment was worth the money it charges, I'd understand it.Terrible drinks, terrible service, terrible prices."
3213,"How can you treat people like trash and still exist?Build your clientele of desperate, approval-seeking lonely folks who have a masochistic streak? That's the only way I can see someone justifying patronage to this BAD JOKE of a bar.Ok, ok, we get it. The bouncer is an a**hole who won't make eye contact or acknowledge anyone. I get it, the bartenders/servers are WAY too busy serving their 2 other, much more important customers. Waiting 35 minutes to order once you're in is the norm! YOU'RE LUCKY TO JUST BE THERE, RIGHT?Seriously. If I had self-esteem issues I'd love this place. But I would rather just drink in a nice quiet place with friends."
3214,"This place is definitely my style. My friend and I walked in here and immediately felt at home being of the goth persuasion as far as our high-school roots go. Even though the drinks were a little pricey for us, we came prepared and were completely satisfied with every single thing we ordered because of its perfection. I feel like this is the kind of place where you would meet some strange and interesting people with amazing life stories. I would feel comfortable sitting here reading or writing poetry - it's just an awesome and dark and mysterious little place. I highly recommend it!"
3215,Love this place!!
3216,"Eat here eat here eat here eat here.I've been to XOCO and Frontera, and I grew up watching Mexico: One Plate At A Time. Which means that I love Rick Bayless a lot, and his food soared above my expectations.Yes, it's a bit pricey, but very filling. Yes, the lines get long--the wait can be unbelievable--but 100% worth it. TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. Come with friends so that you can chat while you wait. I'd also come before you're hungry since you'll probably be in the line for a while.I've had both their soups and salads, and they're wonderful. Well-seasoned and very filling. The guac and salsa is also excellent. If you like hot chocolate that leans towards bitter over sweet, then try theirs--if nothing else, it's a unique experience. I'm also usually a fan of stuffed churros over not, but these ones are AMAZING. Try them. You won't regret it. The dipping sauce and ice-cream combo are drool-worthy.If you're looking for a quiet night out or a date-like place, I wouldn't come here. It does get packed. However, you should DEFINITELY come here with some friends."
3217,"First time at Xoco and it surpassed my expectations. We ordered the barbacoa goat torta, pork belly caldo and hibiscus tea. The food was great. The pork belly soup was amazing with an insane depth of flavor. Most impressive was the customer service. Two minutes after sitting down, Alyssa, the chef came over to let us know that she was just starting a new batch of fideos for the soup and we could wait 10 minutes or she could bring it over without the fideos. We opted to just wait and relax. Five minutes later Alyssa was back with an order of chips, salsa and guacamole on the house to thank us for waiting. A few minutes later a waitress brought over two side salads on the house. Our food arrived a few minutes later and was amazing! Thanks for the great food and wonderful service."
3218,Bayless can do no wrong in my opinion. the tortas are amazing. the churros are incredible. lots of craft beers. cool atmosphere. love this place and anything that ick Bayless cooks.
3219,"Rick bayless: Enough said - the man is a genius and there isnt one bad item on the menu. Rick has a passion for local, quality and often organic ingredients. He never loses that in any of his resurants, including the two in Ohare which share many menu items with XOCO. That top chef torta, well you can tatste one and see why rick is the master! FACT: you havent lived til youve had bean to cup hot cocoa -it will give you muliple g spot orgasms. I miss this place greatly in NYC"
3220,"Had the braised short rib torta, carnita bowl and churros. Everything was fantastic!"
3221,"In a nutshell, this restaurant has unique very flavorful food but has an overlycomplicated ordering/seating process and is overpriced. For the food, I ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, one of the caldos, churros and a beer. The chips and salsa are perfectly fine but come with an incredibly skimpy quantity of guacamole. I had no idea what a caldos was and was surprised when it was delivered but ate it with an open mind and enjoyed it immensely. Think of the caldos as mexican pho. The caldos are intensely flavored and have a perfect balance of flavors. The churros were good as well but perhaps too doughy.My main issue with this restaurant is the bizzare method of ordering food and being seated. You are assigned a table but order at a register. When I entered the restaurant I walked to the register to order and was asked for my table number. I did not have one since I had not sat down. I was told to see a hostess. The hostess told me all seats were taken and instructed me to stand at the front of the line (at the register) and wait for her to come give me a table number. So, I waited for 5 or so minutes like a dope in an empty line looking at a person waiting to take my order at the register. When assigned a table number, I ordered and was shown to my seat and food runners brought my food to me. Very awkward and over thought for a restaurant that is somewhere between chipotle and casual full service mexican. So, 5 stars for food, minus one for the stupid ordering/seating arrangement and minus one more star because the basic meal I ate cost $37 with a small gratuity, which is way too much to pay for the atmosphere, quantity of food and lack of table service."
3222,"decent select,everything taste fresh, well-cooked and perfectly seasoned.the best hot chocolate!better than Jacques-torres.great mexican baked goods.affordable,hearty sandwich.soups-comfort food at its best.I want to move in."
3223,"What can be said about Xoco that has not already been mentioned? Rick Bayless is a chicago legend and has certainly earned his stripes. The food here is very unique, not what you would call your average latin american food, but for Xoco this is a good this. The Agua De Fresco is to die for, i highly reccomed you get the water of the day. I had the roasted pork on ciabatta bread and loved every minute of it. The guac was the best i have ever had and i really don't even care for avacado. This place is a solid bet if your in the loop and want something quick, tasty and unique"
3224,"I've been in love with Rick Bayless since I saw him on Top Chef Masters. I've never had a chance to visit the famous Frontera, so when I found out about this little restaurant he opened, I was very excited to try it! Let me tell you, it lived up to all of my expectations :)First of all, it's adorable, inside and out. I love the facade with its white and blue awnings and the lettering on the windows--it's playful, colorful, and inviting. I wish I lived closer by, because I would swing by every day for a cup of the Aztec Hot Chocolate, which has chile and allspice in it for a fantastic kick! And the churros, which are perfectly done, airy and light and crispy, are only $1.50 each! On second thought, maybe it's better I don't live too close!I went on a Wednesday, and their daily special torta was pork belly with arugula and bacon. I have a weakness for pork belly, so of course I tried it, and it was hard to keep from drooling, the pork belly was so perfectly done. It was a little to rich for a lunch break, so I didn't try anything else, but I am definitely going to go back. I have my eye on the shortrib red chile soup!"
3225,"Xoco is Rick Bayless's third restaurant and is focused on street food. It's meant to be a place to grab a quick lunch. The menu consists mostly of tortas, but damn are they amazing. I had the special of the day which had pork belly and bacon on it. All the ingredients are of the highest quality and so fresh that I wanted to moan while eating my sandwich. I thought I'd have to wait, but it looks like the hype is gone and I was seated immediately. It's counter service, but they have a really good seating set up so customers aren't left standing waiting for a seat. I highly recommend this and will most certainly be returning."
3226,"Hot chocolate and churros...enough said, go check it out already!"
3227,Cory approved.
3228,"Really great food! Super affordable and decent sixed portions (I split a torta with my friend and chips and we were really full) The best part was their service. We ordered out and they forgot to put out chips and guacamole in the takeout bag, so called them and the manager PERSONALLY drove out and delivered to us even though they don't deliver. Plus he threw in some cookies and was extremely polite, we;ll definately be going back!"
3229,"xoco was SO SO good! Line was a little long, but it was well worth it. Chips and guac had so much flavor and portion size was good. i had the ahogada, so delicious. It had pork, black beans, and salsa! The sandwich was huge. My date had the pozole with gunthrop chicken. Excelent as well, another giant portion. I like that Bayless supports the local farms. Something that seems so easy, but not enough restaurants participate in! I can't wait to come back as the staff was so friendly and outgoing and the food was superb!"
3230,"Rick Bayless has done it again. Very good food. Make sure you give yourself ample time to eat since the lines can get very long. Very creative twists to Latin food. Think of it more as upscale fast food. It seems to be structured very well...the lines move quickly, you order, sit down, and still feel as if you're at a sit down restaurant with Rick Bayless' wonderful creations. I have yet to order something I haven't enjoyed. Everything has been very good."
3231,"I cant believe Im just reviewing Xoco now...its funny b/c the first time I went there was earlier this year, right when I had just opened my Yelp account. Months later I have returned, and the quality of food has definitely not changed...if anything its gotten better! My first time there I had the pleasure of having not 1, but 2 tortas! I opted for the Ahogada and the Pepito. The Ahogada is definitely one of my favorites, if not THE favorite at Xoco. It is served in a bowl which the torta comes in, halved and stood upright. Consisting of pork carnitas, black beans, a tomato broth and spicy arbol chile sauce, you are in for a treat. Trust me when I say, you will be repeatedly dipping in this sauce! You have the option of getting it to taste (i.e. mild, spicy, super spicy), I got it very spicy =). The Pepito is easily my 2nd favorite here at Xoco, but then again I have yet to sample the rest of the special menu during the week. The Pepitos protein comes in the form of braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onions, artisan Jack, black beans and pickled jalapenos. If that following rundown of accoutrement didnt get your mouth salivating, I dont know what will! Im glad I tried the both of these tortas!On a side note, the Jamon torta is worth an honorable mention. Definitely get this w the fried egg! On this particular pilgrimage however, I was joined by both my brothers and our friend, as we were in anticipation for some good eats. Having been there before, I assured the bunch that they were in for a treat. Walking through the front door, you could smell the wave of aroma coming through this establishment. Did I mention I saw Rick Bayless on this visit!?This time, I chose the Cochinita Pibil (yes, only one torta this time). Which is suckling pig and achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero. The habanero comes on the side in the form or a sauce. **WARNING** if you like spicy, then you will LOVE the habanero sauce! Be warned! My only gripe my first trip here was that the accompanying sauces were not hot enough...the habanero is HOT! I made the mistake of dipping my first bite of cochinita completely in the sauce and taking a bite....Whoo! wow. very hot stuff.The house made chips and guac are definitely a must have as an accompanying side treat!The real delight though for all of us came at the end of the meal...yup...CHURROS! My youngest brother who I know personally LOVES churros was super stoked to try them. After finishing our meals, the churros came down with their soft serve. GET the side of soft serve to dip your churros in, you will not be sorry! There are a few other tortas I definitely want to try, but what really has my attention is their soups...they look massive and look equally as fulfilling as any of the tortas so Ill be sure to update my review after that. Also, they have a medley of hot chocolate drinks and sweet stuffs.Cash/card is accepted and there is the occasional line so be prepared to wait 30/45 mins. If the line isnt to your liking, cut straight to the register to order to go."
3232,"Here is what matters about Xoco, the food is A. mazing. Seriously. It's insane. The mushroom torta. The ahogada. The chocolate modelo ice cream (please bring it back, it was like a little piece of heaven!). Yes, the way you have to line up is annoying. Yes there is very little table space. But the food more than makes up for it. It's so good, in fact, that my family and I now make 2 trips a year to Xocago that involve (quite literally) nothing but eating at Xoco for 2 days straight. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you stay at the Residence Inn down the block you can get in for breakfast at opening, come back for a late lunch around 2, go to the piano bar around the corner from 6-9:45, and make it back in time for a late dinner before their 10pm closing. All without ever leaving a 2 block radius. Perhaps I should see a therapist for this addiction?"
3233,"I'v been here a couple times now, and cant tell you how much i love these tortas. Forget any torta that you have ever had, these are the best! I have tried just about all of them. You cant go wrong.I dont care about the size of the place, long lines, or the price of the menu but they do need to improve upon the food delivery system and overall communication. The last time I was there they lost our order ( ok whatever, it happens) once we flaged down one of the bussers the food came out in 10. same thing happened with out churros and the hot chocolate. After we ate, the Hostest came to us and appologized and offered us free ice cream. Nice gesture, but that also didnt come and we had to leave. Also, just about every employee is glued to their cell phone which can be slightly frustrating when your food dosnt come.ALL can be forgiven with the food. Will be a happy life time customer"
3234,"This place is good, but not exactly a huge fan. The price is a bit high relative to the service and quality of food. I would rather go to local restaurants and pay about half. Rick's flagship restaurant is damn good and worth every penny, but XOCO is simply nothing impressive. It's good food, but nothing impressive. This might have been like a hyped up movie... good, but didn't live up to the expectations."
3235,"fine tacos , beer , chips, guacamole this is a good life"
3236,Churros rock!!! Great casual place with real tasty mexican street food.
3237,"I don't usually review, but I wanted to express how wonderful this restaurant is. I've been in several times and from time to bottom this menu is unique and really, really good. It's affordable, the atmosphere is great and the food is spot on. Definitely go on Saturday and get the goat--it's DELICIOUS."
3238,"So I went to this place to have churros and a chocolate drink. You'd think these two simple things would be amazing here, right? I mean, with the Bayless and all. Guess what... they're not. I'd rather go to Starbucks and then the churro stand at the Navy Pier, as the food at those places is better, cheaper, and quicker to get despite having to get from one establishment to the next. Bayless is overrated."
3239,"So gf wante to come here because of the famous Rick Bayless, or whoever he is. We didn't even see the guy. Food was overpriced but very tastful. We tried some seafood soup. It was a bit spicy but very fulfiling. It was cool to look at the churro machine. Churro and choloate was good but small portion. I gave this restaurant 3 stars because it was too expensive for me."
3240,"I think XOCO's food is great; however, I didn't feel like the amount of food justified the prices. For lunch, I had the tortilla soup and tamales-maybe I didn't order enough? Anyway, I'm still considering going to Topolobampo sometime, so the Bayless empire is still good by me :)"
3241,"Loved it. We went there for breakfast on a tuesday morning. We got there at around 8.30 and the place only had about 10-15 customers. Service was fast and the food was absolutely delicious. We got 2 chocolate espresso (it wakes you up right away), 1 agua de Jamaica (refreshing), 1 huevos rancheros, 1 egg chorizo torta and 3 churros with chocolate sauce (the chocolate sauce is to die for). A very satisfying meal, bold favors, very refreshing sauces, roasted tomatillo for the torta and roasted tomatoes on the huevos rancheros. All this experience for only around $30. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and try some more items on their menu. We will probably eat at this restaurant every time we will visit Chicago."
3242,"Food was good.. not great.. some of the spice was over powering taking away from the flavor, I'd like to enjoy the food for what it is, everything is fresh which is great, however a little pricey.. place was pretty small too."
3243,"Excellent food, but be prepared to wait. Or get it to go! Either way this is excellent new age Mexican Cousine."
3244,"Bad Pozole. Maybe the chef or kitchen had a bad day. I've actually eaten their pozole before and I was pretty satisfied, but not this time. I'm sure even Rick Bayless himself would have been displeased with the way his own dish tasted or was presented that day. It's been a while since I had this dish and I've procrastinating to write this review, but what I remember the most about this dish was how salty it was and how the chicken pieces were presented. I'll explain the chicken part. Prior to this visit I've had the chicken pozole a few times and I remember the chicken being shredded and thus had a more appealing texture to it. This time however, the chicken was very chewy and instead of shredded pieces, there were sliced cubes of chicken resembling those found in a can of Cambell's soup. To be quite honest, it kind of grossed me out. The presentation, texture, and saltiness of the plate was definitely not up to the standards of a place like this. I didn't say anything to the manager because I rushed out due to another commitment, but I wished I had. Will I return? Maybe, but this time I may try something else."
3245,My first experience in Rick Bayless restaurant was amazing! The food is delicious and also affordable! The second time I went there he was actually out of the kitchen and a lady asked him to take a picture with her. His body guard was next to him but he agreed and made the customer happy! He is a great chef. I love this restaurant!
3246,"One of my favorite places for mexican!! Yes, you may stand in line for 45 minutes to order your food--it is worth it. Do it. Fun place to take family and friends visiting the city. Our trick--ask for a glass of wine while you wait in line. Makes the time fly by!"
3247,"Oh my goodness.Make no mistake, this is not a fine dining restaurant, this is not even a casual restaurant. It shares more in common with a Quiznos than with the former two categories. That said, it is phenomenal.If you go when it's busy, you're asked to wait in line for a table allocation before ordering. It's worth it. You then order at the counter and get your food in 15 minutes or so at your table. Everything is super fresh and made to order. I can recommend both the Pepito and the Woodland Mushroom. It's interesting to have something on a yeasted bread that tastes Mexican, but it makes me want to go to Mexico again.After our delicious dinner, we had some churros, ice cream (with a delicious praline that included bacon, yes, bacon), caf con leche, and melted chocolate mixed with almond milk. Rick Bayless may be a celebrity chef, but he's still working the details in his restaurants. He was working on the ice cream machine when we were there. Super impressed that someone of his caliber is still making sure every little thing is perfect.In summary, go here. You may have to share a table with people you've never met, but enjoy it, make some friends with both the people and the food."
3248,"Waited 1hr in line, paid $13 for a sandwich. Result: size was enough for a kid only, the taste was ok, the bread was good. It's not worth the time and money. You just pay for the name of the chef."
3249,"The line is long, but it is totally worth it! With prices so low on such high quality food, it is no wonder people will stand in line. Three of us shared three courses and all got our own hot cocos for $15 a person. Not only do they have great chocolate everything, but it is the only chocolate without perspectives in Chicago."
3250,"I went to Xoco for the first time yesterday, expecting to battle long lines and longer waits. I thought I was lucky that I only had to wait 20 minutes -- my wait at Frontera last time was just under 5 hours. No joke.I see why the wait here is short(er). The food, while good, is overpriced and overhyped. My partner and I got guacamole, a soup, a sandwich, a cookie, and a hot chocolate. Total bill: $35.First off, that's a pretty stiff bill for a simple dinner for two. The soup (the chicken one) was super salty. The sandwich (jamon torta) was just ok, but nothing special. The guacamole was pretty small and delicious -- but kind of pricey at $4. The chocolate chip hazelnut cookie was ridiculously good.And the hot chocolate? I was so disappointed. I got the Aztec, which is chocolate, water, chile, and allspice. My partner thought it tasted like blood. I thought it was just gross. Nearly undrinkable. Maybe the milk-based ones are better?Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Rick Bayless fan. But I'm skipping Xoco and if I need a Bayless torta, I recommend Frontera Fresca -- they serve a Cubana torta that is pretty much the same as Xoco -- and about $4 cheaper. But Xoco just doesn't come close to the quality and value you get at Frontera and Topolobampo."
3251,One of my most fav restaurants in the area. The torta is succulent and the presentation of the dishes are nice. I had a wonderful waiter very knowledgeable and friendly.
3252,"The soups here are phenomenal, and the heat on the sauces are perfect! Again, quality food at very reasonable prices. I'm loving the wave of restaurants like these in Chicago...thank you to all the restaurant pioneers of Chicago:)"
3253,I'm drooling just thinking about this place. I went there for a later lunch and there was no line. I did seem to order way to much food! The tortas are larger than i expected. The hot chocolate and Churros are a must for dessert!
3254,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for an early dinner (or a late lunch for us) for his birthday. I've been curious about this restaurant for a while now and I couldn't afford Frontera Grill or Topolobampo, so Xoco was perfect. We had probably a 5 minute wait, so I guess we were really lucky. I had the Choriqueso( Homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan Jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. $9.00)was delicious! The verde salsa it came with was amazing. My boyfriend had the Cubana (Smoked Gunthorp pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack, chipotle mustard. $11.50) and he really enjoyed it. To drink, I had the Agua de Jamaica and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend it if you like sweet fruit teas. For dessert, we had a piece of the Choco-Flan and a Churro...Both were to die for. For the two of us, the bill was about 35. Not bad at all for an excellent dinner for two in Chicago.The only thing I didn't like was that you had to ask for a take-out bag. At first I expected them to ask if we wanted to take the rest of our meal home, but after a while, I saw the people next to us go up to the cashier and ask for one so we did the same. Another thing that I didn't like was the seating. Most of the seating has you facing a wall. That made me feel odd, but the food definitely made up for that!This was our first time to Xoco and we both were extremely impressed. Also, we were able to see Rick Bayless! I didn't want to sound like a fangirl, but my bf and I did say that we enjoyed the food and he said thank you. It was a unique experience and I loved the fact that we were able to see him."
3255,"This place is OK. Nothing that special, and the prices are pretty steep. I guess I should try it again."
3256,Such good food. The service is really great for not being a fancy restaurant and whatnot. haha Been back there many of times and will be in the future.
3257,"One meal here rocked my world! My brother and sis-in-law took me here last weekend and it was damn hard to choose. Finally I had the carnitas caldo [soup]: rich, peppery, garlicky, clear broth with a generous portion of roasted pork carnitas, corn-potato dumplings, a couple slices of roasted zucchini, garnished with fresh avocado, fresh mild arugula, and fresh lime. Amazing! If you eat pork, ORDER THIS. It changed my life. The fresh lime juice completed the perfect combination of flavors and textures. The cooked corn chips right out of the cooker had a perfume like no other: earthy, probably just-ground corn (some heirloom variety, I bet). I inhaled the aroma over the dish and probably got high. Amazing! The guac was good, and the red and green chile sauces were interesting & complex. I ordered Aztec chocolate [score one for Kris, who correctly predicted which one I would order before I ever came here], dark chocolate with chilis and allspice. This was so rich I took forever to drink it, and augmented my flour-corn-tortilla-smell high. My life will never be the same. I'll come back as soon as I can get here. And probably order the same thing."
3258,"Went there at lunch time on a Tuesday. Paid $20 for a Pepito sandwich and a 12 ounce beer (bottle). The wait was 15 minutes. There is no take out, you have to wait for a table. At the table I was asked by the hostess if they could seat a stranger at our table of six. We had 5 people so I said no. She told the people waiting that I said no. The sandwich was mediocre, it tasted like an Italian beef but it was mostly bread. The bread was crunchy. On the plus side, they asked my friend if she had a food allergy because she asked for no beans. They made sure to accomodate her. They also provide free sparkling water while you wait."
3259,"never realy had mexican street food, but thought everything here was tasty. I came with a big group and everyone pretty much thought everything was great! I personally liked the short rib torta. I'll def be back and try everything on the menu"
3260,omfg!!!!! love love love love love love. everything ive tried is great!
3261,"Hot chocolate was the best part. Sandwiches are delicious, soup was a little too salty."
3262,"Love the meal-in-a bowl-caldos, pastries and beverage. Good price for the food. Staff are very friendly. Very long line during weekends but totally worth the wait."
3263,"Hi end Mexican. It' smore expensive than Mexican should be. But then the food is to die for. If you are into soups, you absolutely must try. I must warn you, you may get hooked ..."
3264,"Wow.I no longer live in Chicago, but XOCO is tempting me to move back.It's that good.I've only been twice, trying the Ahogada Torta and the Pepito Torta with an order of chips and guacamole both times. Both meals were outstanding. Both were seasoned perfectly. Honestly, I can't think of a single critique of either one. If I had to think of a complaint it's that the guacamole is simply average, not outstanding, and the portion of guacamole is meager. The hostess was very gracious, and although it was busy, things flowed along smoothly. Both times I've been, my experience has been great.If you're in Chicago and looking for a good lunch, XOCO is the place."
3265,"Holy crap this place is uh-mazing! I had some of the porkbelly soup and was blown away by flavors. The pork belly was crispy yet tender, and the broth was just so tasty. It had plenty of avocados, and my mexican friend tells me this is how it should be. I also had the the churro with chocolate, and I could not get enough of it. I don't even like churro (at least the ones I've eaten from Sams club - LOL)! I docked a point off since parking sucks in this area and the seating is lame."
3266,"I've always wanted to try one of Bayless's restaurants and came upon XOCO. I guess it depends on time of day, but there wasn't a huge line even if the place was hopping. All I have to say in this review is that just the mention of pork belly and/or Mexican restaurant immediately sends my mind to the Pork Belly and vermicelli soup at XOCO. The thought of it is mouth-watering. It is hearty, flavorful, has a little spice, just downright yummy. I would eat it weekly (not daily only because I crave other good foods...) given the opportunity. A meal in itself."
3267,I gave this place the best rating because of the food alone. I read other reviews on yelp that had no compliants but only gave 4 stars- I guess the only way those reviewers would give 5 stars is if the food was also free. I have had the Ahogada and the cubana both delicious. However I'm vietnamese so I love soups as meals but I am extremely picky about them. I was actually reluctant to try the caldos here for fear that I would be disappointed. I orderd the Fideo and really loved it. The broth was complex and the texture of the ingredients complimented the flavors. The pork belly was insanely good. No wonder there is a screen blocking your view of how they make their caldos. As for service. I thought for how busy this place is the staff balances it by being very pleasant- full of smiles and helpful suggestions. The hostess is very informative as well as checking back in with you about wait times often. I especially liked this place because on my fourth visit here an obnoxious guy ( He pretended to know Rick Bayless by saying hi to him and asking why is this place always so busy. If you really knew a chef/owner of a busy restaurant it is never seen as a problem that it is constantly busy. Rick just nodded at him without a reply.) cut in front of me to place his order. He knew he cut in front of me - I mean I was standing in front of him for the last 30 minutes. But I guess Xoco karma balances things out here. I was seated next to him and my food came out quickly. I was finished eating and got up to leave before he ever got his food. I saw him look over and look confused about why his food wasn't out yet. This place is great.
3268,"I had been hoping for a chance to dine at this restaurant since I first saw Rick Bayless on Top Chef. I felt a little nervous bringing my friend and her Mexican mother to a trendy Mexican restaurant, but we were all pleasantly surprised. My friend's mom thought that all the food was very authentic and I loved the food as well. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that we got there at 11:05AM and had a 20 minute wait before ordering. But the food was definitely worth the wait!"
3269,"Had an amazing dinner here last night. Have always been a fan of Rick Bayless and glad I was finally able to eat at one of his restaurants. I had the suckling pig torta, guacamole and a churro topped off with a nice Goose Island Matilda. The pork in the torta was amazing. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. I can easily say that it was not only the best torta I've ever had, but it may have been some of the best tasting pork I have ever eaten. The habenero salsa that came with it was fiery and delicous.The guacamole had great flavor and was seasoned perfectly. A lot of times I find guac to be bland, but not here. Very flavorful and delicous. The service was great and the people working there were very knowledgeable about the food and friendly. We waited about 25 min for a table on a wed night at about 8PM. It was well worth the wait and we will definitely be back."
3270,"Amazing. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the wait can get a little ridiculous during peak times. But the food is amazing and the staff is courteous. The Ahogada is by far the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. It's the only thing I get now. Fair warning: you can't get it to go because of the soup component.I noticed someone wrote that the sandwiches aren't large... Uh, I'm not sure how much that guy needs to eat. The Ahoghada is WAY a lot of food. (You should still order the guac though as an appetizer because it's amazing.)Never had the churros yet because I like the hazelnut chocolate chip cookie too much to pass it up.Great food, great service, avoid peak times if you can."
3271,Their food is great but the service is horrible. The staff walks around like they don't have a care in the world and act like they are not there to work. The best thing on their menu that I have had is the Cochinita Pibil. The pork is so tender and juicy.
3272,"I went in with much anticipation due to the gushing of the masses. I stopped in on a Thursday evening around 8 pm, to find a line and a slight wait until a table was ready (inefficient). Similar to other less-than-impressed reviews:DECOR 4LAYOUT 3 (awkward)SERVICE 7FOOD 4 (see below)My friend and I ordered the Carnitas soup, the Ahodaga torta, guac / chips and the Mexican hot chocolate. Unlike street food in Mexico, these prices are not reasonable or representative of anything other than what Rick Bayless can charge in downtown Chicago. $11.50 for a bowl of soup ... need I say more!!GOOD: there are some interesting flavor notes. The chocolate was thick and rich. Guac & chips ... perfect and proven.BAD: SALT, SALT and more SALT in both soup and tortas. I had two sips of soup and shoved it aside. I was hoping someone might ask why we weren't eating it. The torta was upended in the sauce. Not a bad idea if the sandwich was ingested within a couple minutes, but otherwise the bread becomes soggy and the wood fire crunch is lost.Hopefully Rick is taking notes, reading our reviews and adjusting. His perfectionist ways lead me to believe he's doing that as I type."
3273,"Longest wait for food ever. 20 minutes to heat up an already made empanada? The kitchen definitely needs some restructuring, as the two female cooks who handle the 4 hot items on the breakfast menu cannot handle reheating empanadas and bread pudding and constructing sandwiches. I've worked in restaurants, I know that it can be hectic, but this is completely ridiculous. The bad service is overshadowing the experience of the food. I can't even imagine what it would be like to wait for lunch, and I probably will never go for lunch because of my negative experiences with breakfast. It's disappointing to say the least. I'm sure a lot of people were excited for this place to open; exactly what Chicago needs right now, but the service will definitely keep me from coming back. The only employee that I've had a positive experience with is the cute pregnant girl at the register, she is a doll."
3274,"Why are people complaining about service? You don't come to a place like this for service, you come for the food. You knew going into the experience you would have to wait so why post a complaint when you arrive and SURPRISE, there is a wait. You also don't come for the ambiance so why comment. I had-1. Chips w/Guac and Salsa- So so but didn't come for the chips/salsa.2. Ahodaga Torta- Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. It was delicious, a must get. 3. Aztec Hot Chocolate- Very good. Best Hot Chocolate I have had, love the fresh chocolate made in house with the touch of chile/all spice. 4. Churros- nice touch to end the meal.Come for the food, leave your complaining at home. One of the waitresses will warn you of the wait when you arrive so don't complain after you wait, it was your choice."
3275,"Rick Bayless. The name is Chicago glory. Winning Top Chef Masters is like winning Art Prize, Bushido and the Chicago Marathon all in the same year. So, yeah, he's decent at his craft.Of Course everyone is raving about the churros and hot chocolate (I had the Barcelona-- if you know me you know there's a strange obsession there.)The couple together is like animalistic coitus of the mouth. I got jabbed in the ribs for moaning.The only problem here is that the tortas (okay these are really kinda like fancy, delicious versions of a toasted sub) are a bit pricey for what you get -- but there is the fact that you get free filtered sparkling water from a tap! How rad is that... I fucking love that shit!! I had the torta with suckling pig. Of course it was good, but was it $12 good... i guess relative to what/whom is the question. The habanero sauce it came with was addictive in it's mouth numbing properties, but it totally outmatched the sandwich and that fact surprised me since it's from flavor perfectionist Bayless.I'll be back for sure. After all they were not serving the head cheese torta when I went."
3276,"Went back again for dinner...it was great! I got the chorizo torta, roast pork torta, shortrib soup, Aztec hot chocolate, churros, and Jamaica agua fresca. It was all very good. The sandwiches were excellent, very orgasmic in flavor and texture. Soup was ok, but it was huge, so either get one or the other, its a meal in its own right. Churros were warm and went great with the Aztec; though the Aztec wasnt as spicy as I was expecting, only a very light hint of heat. Anyways, definitely heading back asap!! I thought of another commenters quote of everything Bayless touches turning to gold, very true here. Muy bien Rick!"
3277,"REALLY GREAT...WITH ONE BIG CAVEATFantastic sandwiches - among the best in recent memory. The chroizo was perfect, lots of great flavors that worked really well together. Complimentary sparkling water is a great touch as well.HOWEVER...if you've ever had hot chocolate in Barcelona, you will be VERY disappointed by their Barcelona hot chocolate, which is like to real Barcelona hot chocolate the way Manischewitz Extra Heavy Malaga is to a bottle of vintage Chateau d'Yquem. If you drive all the way downtown expecting Barcelona-style hot chocolate you will be, like me, a not very happy camper."
3278,chef bayless and staff are great cooks and honor the mayan and azteca traditional style of cooking w/ all colorful and tasty ingredients.thanks chefcal shummonmissionnairesdusaint-esprit/president
3279,"the churro was the best, however a little pricey for a churro. But i can't stop thinking about how i need just one more. My husband and I split a cuban sandwich and some of the homemade hot chocolate. I have always been a big fan of Bayless. He stays true to good, local flavors and ingredients. XoCo is not to be missed. The line was a little long (about 25-30 minutes), but isn't it everywhere in Chicago?"
3280,"Gag, gag, gag! I was so excited before going to this restaurant because I read such good reviews. It turns out there is little to be excited about. The food is tasteless, little portions, and nothing to rave about. Its flavorless and overpriced! Please, please, please save your money and go elsewhere because this place will leave you sorely disappointed."
3281,One word: Amazing. Words cannot describe this meal. Recommend trying it for yourself.
3282,"I wish I could give five stars, because the food is really delicious! Always well-seasoned (I think they use crack cocaine on the chips though, because I always get hooked after the first one!) and lovingly prepared. But today, I opted to not get water (or any drink) because I picked up 2 glasses from the stacks (water is self-service) that were FILTHY! How disappointed was I today?? I love XOCO, but they need a new dishwasher."
3283,suckling pig sandwiches at this place? i don't care how good the bread is...what kind of creep kills a baby pig?
3284,"This is close to a 5 start. The sandwiches were fabulous! I had theMilanesa which is: Crispy chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa. My husband ordered the Mole Poblano which is: braised pork, wood-grilled onions, crunchy garnishes, and fresh cheese. If you go on an empty stomach, make sure to order a side salad or their chips as my husband was somewhat hungry he left. This is definitely a place I would crave on a regular basis. Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu."
3285,One of my favorites in Chicago!
3286,"Yes, you're going to have to most likely wait to sit down. That's because this place is so popular. If you're wanting to eat quicker, yet don't want to take your meal to go and are willing to stand up while you eat, get your food to go, then just take it to the little counter next to the door. No one will question you and you can watch everyone you were just standing in line with wait for another 30 minutes. The food itself? Absolutely high quality. It's Rick Bayless. Top Chef Masters Champion, and you can eat at one of his restaurants for under $15 bucks. I'm not a big hot chocolate fan, but the blend they make here is great. You honestly can't go wrong with anything."
3287,"Had lunch here last week, and loved it. I had the Xoco salad with pork, and my friend had a sandwich. There was a long line, but it moved surprisingly fast considering it was lunch on a Friday afternoon. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was that I would have loved to be able to get their sandwiches as a salad - a great option for those with food allergies."
3288,"this popped up in my old neighborhood so we checked it out for lunch one day. Very reasonably priced food, and all sorts of people in the place. The soy chicken was excellent, and the lunch special is $9.95 and comes with 2 mini egg rolls and kind of a small salad but it is a perfect portion. I had the basil noodles, spicy with the soy chicken. They deliver all the way to Kedzie so I will order from them for delivery soon!"
