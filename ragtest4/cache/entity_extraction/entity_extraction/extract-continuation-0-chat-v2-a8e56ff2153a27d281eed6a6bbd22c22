I agree with most of his review. It is technically on point. I break it down like this for those who don't like reading or know much about $700 a person restaurants... If you eat a lot of truffles, Asian street food, animal hearts, sea urchins, and not-so-everyday fruits and vegetables mixed in a juicer, you may find Alinea enjoyable, but not as inspired as advertised. If you don't, you may be in for a bit of a palate shock. For an extremely expensive restaurant, Alinea delivers. By the end of the meal, I found the $150 basic wine pairing (the reserve pairing was $250) along with its accompanying service to be the bargain and maybe highlight of the meal. For me, things broke down into thirds. About a third of the courses were simply inegnious for creativity in presentation. Winter in New Hampshire, the final dessert, and the Ice dish as the centerpiece were brilliant. Another third were straightforward, but delicious. The mushrooms led this category for me. Finally, all the rest were a mix of lacking in creativity or simply good, but not great. Since each night is different, I am curious if others sense the same kind of breakdown when they eat here. The service at Alinea is excellent, though some of our servers seemed happier to be there than others.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative and expensive dining experiences, offering unique dishes that include truffles, Asian street food, and other exotic ingredients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID L.<|>PERSON<|>David L. is a reviewer who dined at Alinea and provided feedback on the restaurant's offerings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE<|>EVENT<|>Winter in New Hampshire is a dessert course served at Alinea, noted for its creativity in presentation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE DISH<|>EVENT<|>The Ice dish is a centerpiece course at Alinea, recognized for its brilliant presentation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Mushrooms are a dish served at Alinea that is highlighted for being straightforward yet delicious.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The service at Alinea is described as excellent, with varying levels of enthusiasm among the staff.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Truffles are a luxurious ingredient featured in Alinea's menu, contributing to the restaurant's high price point.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN STREET FOOD<|>EVENT<|>Asian street food is a type of cuisine offered at Alinea, adding to the diverse menu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIMAL HEARTS<|>EVENT<|>Animal hearts are an exotic ingredient included in Alinea's dishes, showcasing the restaurant's adventurous culinary style.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEA URCHINS<|>EVENT<|>Sea urchins are another unique ingredient featured in Alinea's offerings, appealing to adventurous diners.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID L.<|>ALINEA<|>David L. dined at Alinea and provided a review of his experience, sharing insights on the food and service.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>WINTER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE<|>Winter in New Hampshire is a dessert course served at Alinea, noted for its creativity.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>ICE DISH<|>The Ice dish is a centerpiece course at Alinea, recognized for its brilliant presentation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>MUSHROOMS<|>Mushrooms are a dish served at Alinea that is highlighted for being straightforward yet delicious.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>TRUFFLES<|>Truffles are a luxurious ingredient featured in Alinea's menu, contributing to the restaurant's high price point.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>ASIAN STREET FOOD<|>Asian street food is a type of cuisine offered at Alinea, adding to the diverse menu.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>ANIMAL HEARTS<|>Animal hearts are an exotic ingredient included in Alinea's dishes, showcasing the restaurant's adventurous culinary style.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SEA URCHINS<|>Sea urchins are another unique ingredient featured in Alinea's offerings, appealing to adventurous diners.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SERVICE<|>The service at Alinea is described as excellent, with varying levels of enthusiasm among the staff.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
