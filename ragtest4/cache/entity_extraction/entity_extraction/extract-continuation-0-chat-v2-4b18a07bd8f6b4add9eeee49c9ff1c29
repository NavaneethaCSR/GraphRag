I was planning a trip for our 8 yr anniversary... since I hadn't been to Chicago in awhile, I decided this is were would would go. So I get on the trusty ole' computer and sign on to my faithful YELP.COM... I look up the Chicago sight, and BAM! at the top of the list... Alinea. I read several reviews and I am sold! I get on the phone and make a reservation, about a month and half away from our anniversary I was fortunate enough that they have an opening the day prior to our anniversary, so take it, these guys are booked solid, can't pass up this opportunity, right? I pretty much have the trip planned, this is going to be a foodie journey, Alinea, Moto,Blackbird, Avec, Burt's Place, Perry's, Silver Palm, Super Doug's and then fly back home.... so Alinea is first, the plan is to fly out the morning of the reservation, get to the hotel freshen up relax and get ready for our special evening, we can hardly wait.... So the morning of our departure... we wake up late and miss our 6:30AM flight... okay let's not freak out... we'll standby hopefully we can get on the next one... 10am... nope, 12pm... nope...2pm...:(... 4pm... announcement \"next three flights to Chicago are canceled!!!!!\" WHAT!!! We have no choice but call the restaurant and cancel our special anniversary dinner :(... they are booked solid for the next three days that we'll be in town...we get a new flight for the next morning same time...and figure oh well maybe next time... So we arrive on time and fly out... we arrive relax for awhile, walk downtown go to Perry's for an awesome Pastrami sandwich, and my wife makes the obligatory trek to H&M.... while we're there I get a call from Alinea... they've had a cancellation for 6:30pm tonight... it's 3:30, I say YES, and drag my wife out of the store and hurry back to the hotel so she can take her mandatory 2 hrs to get ready journey....finally we make it! (had to cancel reservations at Avec, but reschedule for lunch the next day.) So we arrive at the brownstone building with really nothing to identify it as Alinea, other than a valet guy right outside... we walk in to Star Ship Enterprise's walkway... I have no idea where I'm going, LOL we walk a few steps and a door to the left opens, we are greeted by name at the door by the hostess and follow her to our table, a bottle of wine is waiting for us as I had this arranged earlier. Let the experience commence.... English Pea, Shad Roe, distillation of thai flavors, Pork Belly, Sturgeon, King Crab, Duck, Hot Potato, Tournedo, Black Truffle, Earl Grey, Chocolate... and bubblegum... our menu.... AMAZING. The best meal I have ever EXPERIENCED, not had, EXPERIENCED! Don't think there is anything else I can say..... I will say this... I can't believe it took me soo long to write my review, I almost feel ashamed, but I did it because after watching Andrew Zimmern's Bizarre Foods this past week, and seeing him experience what we did when went, it's as if I relived the entire experience again. The words he used to describe this place were 1000% exact. Everyone must try Alinea.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in Illinois, known for its vibrant food scene and cultural attractions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant in Chicago, renowned for its innovative and artistic dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YELP.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yelp.com is a website that provides user-generated reviews and recommendations for restaurants and other businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERRY'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Perry's is a restaurant known for its pastrami sandwiches, located in Chicago.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moto is a restaurant in Chicago known for its creative and avant-garde cuisine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKBIRD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blackbird is a restaurant in Chicago that offers contemporary American cuisine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avec is a restaurant in Chicago known for its Mediterranean-inspired dishes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURT'S PLACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Burt's Place is a pizzeria in Chicago known for its deep-dish pizza.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILVER PALM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Silver Palm is a restaurant in Chicago known for its eclectic menu and vibrant atmosphere.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPER DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Super Doug's is a restaurant in Chicago known for its casual dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIFE<|>PERSON<|>The narrator's wife, who is involved in planning the anniversary trip and dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDREW ZIMMERN<|>PERSON<|>Andrew Zimmern is a television personality known for his food-related shows, including Bizarre Foods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNIVERSARY<|>EVENT<|>The anniversary celebration for the narrator and their wife, which includes a planned dinner at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLIGHT<|>EVENT<|>The flight that the narrator and their wife missed, which affected their travel plans to Chicago.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESERVATION<|>EVENT<|>The reservation made at Alinea for the anniversary dinner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCELLATION<|>EVENT<|>The cancellation of the reservation at Alinea due to missed flights.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERIENCE<|>EVENT<|>The overall dining experience at Alinea, described as amazing and memorable.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALL<|>VERB<|>The action of Alinea contacting the narrator to inform them of a cancellation opportunity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARRIVE<|>VERB<|>The action of the narrator and their wife arriving in Chicago for their trip.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAKE<|>VERB<|>The action of making a reservation at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HURRY<|>VERB<|>The action of the narrator urging their wife to get ready quickly for their dinner at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIFE<|>NARRATOR<|>The narrator and their wife are partners celebrating their anniversary together.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>ALINEA<|>The narrator planned to celebrate their anniversary at Alinea, indicating a personal connection to the restaurant.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>CHICAGO<|>The narrator traveled to Chicago for their anniversary celebration, establishing a geographical connection.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>YELP.COM<|>The narrator used Yelp.com to find and research Alinea, showing a reliance on the platform for dining decisions.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>FLIGHT<|>The narrator's missed flight impacted their travel plans, creating a direct relationship between the two events.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>RESERVATION<|>The narrator made a reservation at Alinea for their anniversary dinner, indicating a planned event.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>CANCELLATION<|>The cancellation of the reservation at Alinea was a direct consequence of the missed flight.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>EXPERIENCE<|>The dining experience at Alinea is described as amazing, highlighting the restaurant's significance in the narrator's anniversary celebration.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>CALL<|>Alinea called the narrator to inform them of a cancellation opportunity, indicating a direct interaction.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>PERRY'S<|>The narrator visited Perry's for a pastrami sandwich while in Chicago, indicating a dining experience connection.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>ANDREW ZIMMERN<|>The narrator references Andrew Zimmern's show, indicating a shared interest in food experiences.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>WIFE<|>The wife was involved in the decision to dine at Alinea, indicating a shared experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>ANNIVERSARY<|>The narrator's trip to Chicago was planned to celebrate their anniversary, establishing a thematic connection.<|>10)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
