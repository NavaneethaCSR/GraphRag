I couldn't say no to this place after seeing it on the Travel Channel with Anthony Bourdain. So what did I do? I dragged my Chicagoan friend out on a Saturday and said, \"we HAVE to go to this place\". After almost an hour-long commute from downtown, we finally find the place around 1pm and the line is relentless. We were starving already but we thought we'd tough it out because this place was supposed to be the best and we were semi-prepared having heard of the long waits before. Hunger went from waiting to impatience to craziness. At one point it started raining and we hoped people would just give up and leave the line... but nope. They stood there like soldiers, whipping out their umbrellas (they were ALL prepared) to shield themselves from the rain. Two hours and 15 minutes later, we arrived at the front of the line and our eyes being bigger than our stomachs (seriously, two extremely hungry girls are not a pretty sight) decided to order duck fat fries and 4 hot dogs. FOUR! (We usually can just eat 1 and we're golden.) A Paul Kelly, The Dog, a Smoked Debreziner, and the Antelope Sausage. Everything was pretty good minus the weird gaminess of the antelope... that was a little much for me but at least now I can say I've tried antelope! Wish the duck fat fries had more duck flavor, or just flavor period, but everything was still good enough to be devoured completely. Not a scrap left! Seriously--we ate more than some couples who at least had one guy to eat, and we were more than fat (or full to put it nicely) after our meal!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
