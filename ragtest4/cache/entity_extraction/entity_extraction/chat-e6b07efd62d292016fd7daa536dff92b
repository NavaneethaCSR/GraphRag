The 30 minute wait (not including the 20 minutes before opening) was worth it though. All of the hot dogs are named after celebrities and you can get them char grilled, boiled, or some other way I can't remember. They also have specialty dogs. Doug is the one that took our order and he is the most friendly and courteous person that I have ever had the pleasure to order from. He's very helpful in picking something that you'd like and doesn't try to rush you to order to get to the next person in line. One of the things that I was amazed about this place was that even though there was a super long time out the door, whenever you got around to placing your order, there was always a place to sit. The rate at which people finished eating and rate at which people ordered matched perfectly! I got this Portuguese sausage with iberico (?) cheese. It was really good--slightly spicy but it was a great kick. The only thing I didn't like about it was that whenever I bit into it, it smelt like feet. The cheese on it was very, very, strong smelling. But so good! I also got the foie gras hot dog. It was my first time eating foie gras and I was kind of nervous, but that dog was so good! I think the dog is stuffed with duck entrails and then they add 3 pretty thick slices of pate on top. I liked it better than the Portuguese sausage. It was on the heavier side, but so delicious!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
