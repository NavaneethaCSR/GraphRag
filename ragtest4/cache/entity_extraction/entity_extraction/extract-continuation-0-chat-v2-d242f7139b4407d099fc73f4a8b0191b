The food was a strange and delightful trip. Very interesting to have a 140 yr old classic dish like the Pigeonneau a la St Clair served in the middle of a post-modern deconstructionist / molecular gastronomy dinner. It showed they could do \"normal\" cooking at an extraordinary level as well. Let me describe some of the dishes: Oxalis - tiny little sorrel flowers that taste like baby snow pea shoots in a juniper gin gelatin. Served on a shiny bent \"guitar pick\" eaten as a bite that is both crunchy (the flowers) and soft (the jelly). A dish called Lilac because of the lilac foam around the dish. The center of the dish is what \"seafood chowder\" would taste like if they served it in Heaven. Clams and Scallops in cream but with fresh celery, herb sprigs, and a surprisingly sweet addition of tiny melon balls. Tomato with olive oil \"snow\" and olive-fig \"chocolate\" sauce. Served with fresh figs with a large tomato plant brought to the table to proved an \"aroma\" addition to the course. Butterscotch Bacon and Japanese Cedar Smoked Date Parfait. Foie Gras with Fennel and Shiso (Japanese Mint) on a fork - just warm enough the Foie Gras melts like butter in your mouth with savory delight and a slight crunch from the Fennel. As you finish the Foie Gras, you drink the fresh Japanese Peach juice in the bottom of the glass for an explosion of lightly sweet fruit that clings to the fats on your tongue from the Foie Gras. Crab Parfait. This one was hard to wrap my brain around. The flavors were of ginger, spices, and carrots - like a delicious carrot cake. The texture was like a fluffy and airy parfait. Then at the bottom was *POW* king crab in gelatinized duck fat. The contrast of the flavors and textures was basically overstimulating all my taste buds. Two types of Rhubarb on Goat's Milk Cheesecake: A freeze-dried crunchy rhubarb sorbet and a transparent rhubarb \"glass\". These are served on top of pillows filled with lavender scented air. The weight of the plates slowly diffuses lavender from the pillow into your table area as you eat the delicious cheesecake and rhubarb dessert. All the food was absolutely amazing and definitely 5 stars. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I also got the wine paring (which raises the price to $500/pp from $300/pp after tax and tip) and I felt the wine pairing was not worth the extra $200. I guess I am pickier with my wines and prefer mostly earthy reds -- the wine pairing was mostly whites, champaign, and a strong aquavit (and fire-water is not ideally the first thing they should serve on an empty stomach for a 25 course meal). I would highly recommend the tour with just one or two glasses of wine or beverage ala carte and you will save about $160-170 over the full pairing.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative and artistic dining experiences, offering a 25-course meal that combines classic and modern culinary techniques.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIGEONNEAU A LA ST CLAIR<|>EVENT<|>A classic dish served at Alinea, showcasing traditional cooking methods within a modern dining context.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXALIS<|>EVENT<|>A dish featuring tiny sorrel flowers served in a juniper gin gelatin, highlighting the restaurant's focus on unique flavor combinations and presentation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LILAC<|>EVENT<|>A dish named for its lilac foam, representing Alinea's creative approach to flavor and aesthetics.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIE GRAS<|>EVENT<|>A dish served warm with fennel and shiso, designed to melt in the mouth, exemplifying Alinea's commitment to luxurious ingredients and textures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAB PARFAIT<|>EVENT<|>A dish that combines flavors of ginger, spices, and carrots with king crab, showcasing Alinea's innovative use of textures and flavors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB ON GOAT'S MILK CHEESECAKE<|>EVENT<|>A dessert featuring freeze-dried rhubarb sorbet and a transparent rhubarb glass, served with lavender-scented air, illustrating Alinea's artistic dessert presentations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>EVENT<|>A selection of wines offered with the meal, which the reviewer found to be overpriced and not worth the additional cost.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVIEW<|>EVENT<|>The overall assessment of the dining experience at Alinea, which was rated 4 stars due to the wine pairing cost.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>The experience of dining at Alinea, characterized by a lengthy and elaborate meal consisting of 25 courses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>500/PP<|>LOCATION<|>The price per person for the wine pairing at Alinea, indicating the high cost of the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>300/PP<|>LOCATION<|>The base price per person for the meal at Alinea without the wine pairing.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>PIGEONNEAU A LA ST CLAIR<|>Pigeonneau a la St Clair is a classic dish served at Alinea, showcasing its culinary expertise.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>OXALIS<|>Oxalis is a unique dish offered at Alinea, reflecting its innovative approach to cuisine.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>LILAC<|>Lilac is a dish at Alinea that exemplifies the restaurant's creative culinary style.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>FOIE GRAS<|>Foie Gras is a luxurious dish served at Alinea, highlighting its focus on high-quality ingredients.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>CRAB PARFAIT<|>Crab Parfait is an inventive dish at Alinea, showcasing its unique flavor combinations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>RHUBARB ON GOAT'S MILK CHEESECAKE<|>Rhubarb on Goat's Milk Cheesecake is a dessert that illustrates Alinea's artistic presentation style.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>WINE PAIRING<|>The wine pairing is an additional offering at Alinea that the reviewer found to be overpriced.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVIEW<|>ALINEA<|>The review provides an overall assessment of the dining experience at Alinea, rating it 4 stars.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>ALINEA<|>The dinner experience at Alinea consists of a 25-course meal, showcasing the restaurant's culinary artistry.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>500/PP<|>WINE PAIRING<|>The price of $500 per person refers to the cost of the wine pairing at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>300/PP<|>ALINEA<|>The base price of $300 per person is for the meal at Alinea without the wine pairing.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
