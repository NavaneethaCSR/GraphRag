It was 10 degrees. Pretty cold if you ask me. My toes are still frozen! I waited in line with an unemployed lawyer and a culinary school student - very delightful people who helped me figure things out before we got to the register. I believe I waited about 20 or 30 minutes but the line was short so most of it was in the vestibule and inside the joint. Doug was very courteous as were all of his employees. He runs a tight shift. Very organized. I ordered a grilled dog with everything and sport peppers, fries and the gourmet sausage: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris ($9.00 - pretty pricey but I really wanted to try Foie Gras). Now, I really love liver, I understand Foie Gras is very different than you everyday, run of the mill fried liver, but this, really wasn't good. I think I hurried into the extreme and I should of taken it slow and tried a fire dog or something on the regular menu before moving to such advanced culinary delights. Totally un-delightful for me. Didn't care for the sausage at all. There was something off about it. Not sure. I can't really compare to any other times since this was a first for me. The Dog though was great! The sport peppers were so perfect and the fries were really good too. I like the ketchup bottles at the table so that I can pour as much as possible on my fries. Yum! Why 3 stars? Although the hot dog was great and the fries were good, had I stopped at that, I may bump it up to 4 stars but being that the sausage was $9 and tasted like a greasy mess, 3 stars is being generous. I'll definitely go back, and try something else. I should of tried the Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Spicy White Peach Mayonnaise, Creme de Brie Cheese and Roasted Plantains, oh well. No biggie. A 3 is pretty good score. You don't need to have a 4 and 5 all the time to be perfectly good.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
