Thanks Miranda. I mean just spectacular and creative. I mean i sat down for 4 hours, and dish after dish was amazing, not a lot of food, just small and good. Not only was the food good but the way they presented it and the ideas behind it extravagant. Note to diners: is the wine pairing worth it? only if you want to spend 200 smackeroo's to make your mouth have more of an orgasm then it's already having. No thanks i'll just choose the 300 bottle of wine instead. All in all this is one of the best dining experiences i have EVER had, other was in Bordeaux, which is a bit different. So this is a must do for foodies, I have yet to try other top restaurants in the nation, will make my way to Per Se, and French Laundry sooner rather than later.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WOW WOW WOW is a restaurant known for its spectacular and creative dining experiences, offering small but exquisite dishes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIRANDA<|>PERSON<|>Miranda is the girlfriend's cousin who helped secure reservations at WOW WOW WOW.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SF<|>GEO<|>SF refers to San Francisco, the city from which the narrator flew to dine at WOW WOW WOW.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BORDEAUX<|>GEO<|>Bordeaux is a city in France known for its wine and dining experiences, mentioned as a comparison to WOW WOW WOW.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PER SE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Per Se is a top restaurant in the nation that the narrator plans to visit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>French Laundry is another top restaurant in the nation that the narrator intends to try.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>EVENT<|>The dining experience at WOW WOW WOW is described as one of the best the narrator has ever had.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>EVENT<|>The wine pairing at WOW WOW WOW is discussed as an optional enhancement to the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>300 BOTTLE OF WINE<|>LOCATION<|>Refers to the choice of a specific wine priced at 300 dollars, mentioned in the context of the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIRANDA<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>Miranda helped secure reservations at WOW WOW WOW, enabling the narrator's dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SF<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>The narrator flew from San Francisco to dine at WOW WOW WOW, indicating a geographical connection.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BORDEAUX<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>Bordeaux is mentioned as a comparison to the dining experience at WOW WOW WOW, highlighting its significance.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PER SE<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>The narrator plans to visit Per Se, indicating it is another restaurant of interest following the experience at WOW WOW WOW.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>The narrator intends to try French Laundry, suggesting it is another notable dining destination.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>The dining experience at WOW WOW WOW is described as exceptional, emphasizing its quality.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>The wine pairing is discussed in relation to the dining experience at WOW WOW WOW, indicating its optional nature.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>300 BOTTLE OF WINE<|>WOW WOW WOW<|>The choice of a 300 dollar bottle of wine is mentioned in the context of the dining experience at WOW WOW WOW, indicating a connection.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
