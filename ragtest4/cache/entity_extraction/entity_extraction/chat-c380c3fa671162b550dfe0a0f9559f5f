The single best bite of food I've ever tasted was at Alinea (and that isn't hyperbole, I can still recall each flavor and how they mixed together) 2. The meal as a whole was very disappointing I loved a quarter of the courses in this experience, thought a third were pretty good, and the rest were sub par at best. We only had 18 courses. One of those courses was a leaf, literally a leaf on a plate. Another course was based on peas. Yes, an entire course on peas. My girlfriend and I discussed a few weeks later (meal was in July 2011) and concluded that the summer menu just must not compare to the other seasons. Otherwise we didn't understand the accolades. We've eaten at Moto, and that was signifcantly better. Another explanation is that perhaps Alinea is just hit or miss based on that night's menu. But if that's the case, then they've failed. At the prices you're paying, it has to be awesome every single time. Ours definitely wasn't. And there's the rub. I would gladly pay whatever to eat that one wonderful bite of food again... but can't. I would gladly pay the Alinea price to be able to pick my own menu from several selections at each stage... but can't. And since I have no control at all then you have to do better than odd tasting peas and a leaf on a plate. Service was absolutely top notch. Last note: after we left my gf and I were both hungry (and we are not big eaters). We actually debated going to grab an appetizer or dessert somewhere else afterward, and just barely decided against since it was so late. And we ate everything put in front of us at Alinea.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
