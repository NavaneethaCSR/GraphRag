If you think fast food is actually food, you won't like Alinea. If you are the kind of person who thinks that the more money you spend, the more quantity of food you should get, walk AWAY and never think of coming to Alinea again. Now, having said all that: ALINEA IS FOOD PORN. There is no way you could possibly replicate the experience at home, and probably 99% of all restaurants in this country couldn't come close. It is as good as everyone says it is. There were only two things I would have changed about the experience. Firstly, the reservationist was a bit snooty. For a Five Star dining experience, I kind of expect that the whole thing--from the people you talk to on the phone all the way to the guy who hails you a cab at the end of the evening--should be top notch. Secondly: the staff at Alinea are a veritable treasure trove of information. However they seemed to be a tad stiff and if I attempted to go beyond the usual \"what's this??!\" question format, they seemed uncomfortable and scurried off. Finally--the reviews are true. The 20+ tasting course is a lot of flavors (not necessarily a lot of food), but it is well worth it, as are the expertly selected wine pairings. To prepare for this meal, I ate very little all day leading up to it and had a nice round of cardio at the gym before I went. In summation: if you are a foodie and have some cash to burn this place is TOTALLY worth it. GO.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
