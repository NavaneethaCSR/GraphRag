Well, food... need I say more? It is hard, sometimes, to pack enough flavor in tasting portions since they are so small, and I know chefs would season these dishes more heavily with salt to emphize flavors. There was none of that going on here. At Alinea the flavor of the ingredients shine, and half way through the meal I raised my head and said, \"Man, this guys are not shy on flavors.\" The food was fun, exciting and emotionaly stirring. My wife and I were giggling through the entire meal like little school girls. We even got the chef to sign our menu (f'ing tourists...) and tour the kitchen. Our experience at Alinea was the highlight of our trip to Chicago. There was one thing though: at the price we were paying for for a 12 course tasting menu (4/15) I was expecting a little more luxury ingredients. But the interesting concept and execution of every dish more than made up for the lack of caviars and foie gras and abalone.
