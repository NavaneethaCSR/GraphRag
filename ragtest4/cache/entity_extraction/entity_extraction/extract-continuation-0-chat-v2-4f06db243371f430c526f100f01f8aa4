My best friend and I were flying to Chicago from Atlanta to witness his younger sister's graduation from Northwestern, so we made a reservation to a place we'd heard nothing but astounding things about. Turns out, these grand statements were completely true. We got the 12 course meal with wine pairings and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the meal of my life. From a dish resting on a pillow of scented air that deflated as the meal went on, to what amounted to a shredded duck candy bar to any number of immaculately presented treats, Alinea was a feast for the eyes, stomach, nose and mind. For what it's worth, our meal took about four hours and we each spent around $370 for food, beverage and tip.
