From the moment you enter the modern unassuming dining room, you're greeted with a friendly staff who delight in presenting your dishes. Each course plays out theatrically in unexpected sensational ways. I hesitated to touch these \"food sculptures\", because they're unlike anything I've seen let alone eaten. But they encourage you to play with your food, explore it's textures and tastes. Whether it was a frozen pea soup that melted in your mouth, or dessert served on a rapidly deflating pillow of Earl Grey essence, you're rewarded simply for participating. The night which began with low key chatter grew livelier as fellow diners shared their dining experiences with the rest of the room. This is perhaps the closest thing to interactive dinner theater, because the enjoyment comes as much from the reveal as it does from the taste.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its unique and entertaining tasting experiences that engage diners in a theatrical manner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD SCULPTURES<|>EVENT<|>Food sculptures are creatively presented dishes at Alinea that encourage diners to interact with their food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>EVENT<|>The overall dining experience at Alinea is characterized by interactive and sensory engagement with food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Earl Grey ESSENCE<|>LOCATION<|>Earl Grey essence is a flavor component used in a dessert served at Alinea, enhancing the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FROZEN PEA SOUP<|>LOCATION<|>Frozen pea soup is a dish served at Alinea that melts in the mouth, contributing to the unique tasting experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAFF<|>PERSON<|>The friendly staff at Alinea are dedicated to enhancing the dining experience by presenting dishes in an engaging manner.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINERS<|>PERSON<|>Fellow diners at Alinea contribute to the lively atmosphere by sharing their experiences with each other.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>STAFF<|>The staff at Alinea play a crucial role in creating a unique and entertaining dining experience for guests.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>Alinea is known for its distinctive dining experience that combines food with theatrical presentation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>FOOD SCULPTURES<|>Food sculptures are a key feature of the dining experience at Alinea, enhancing interactivity.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>DINERS<|>Diners contribute to the dining experience by sharing their thoughts and engaging with the food and each other.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>Earl Grey ESSENCE<|>Earl Grey essence is part of the dessert that contributes to the overall dining experience at Alinea.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>FROZEN PEA SOUP<|>Frozen pea soup is an example of the innovative dishes that define the dining experience at Alinea.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
