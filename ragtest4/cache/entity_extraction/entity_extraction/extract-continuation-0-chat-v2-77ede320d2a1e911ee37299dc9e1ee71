There might be a question, and that is: is it worth the $$$$? I won't bury the lede ... yes! It ain't cheap, but if you want a meal that you will flat-out be talking about years from now, this is the place. Was every single bite and meal the greatest thing I ever had? No. But I remember each and every single bite like it was yesterday. So does my wife. I look at our menu with fond recollections. Seriously, save $15/week for a year (skip pizza night every other week, really), and the have a night that you will remember. And isn't that the best thing about food, the memories?
