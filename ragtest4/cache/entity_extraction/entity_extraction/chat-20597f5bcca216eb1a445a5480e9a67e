Occasionally I like a good hot dog. But stand in line for 1-3 hours? No way. Today was a lovely summer day and we found ourselves with a little time, so my boyfriend decided we should go to Hot Doug's, because he'd been one of those schmucks who stood in line and said he wanted me to be able to have the experience. We drove by and when he saw the line, he said it'd probably be about an hour. After some debating and realizing this would probably be the last time we could do this for a while, we decided to go for it. Our total time, including eating, took us a little over an hour. I had planned to get only one dog, but he said I'd likely do fine with two. So I chose one from their cheap ($2-3) regular menu and one from their specialty menu ($7-9). We also shared a small order of cheese fries. We ended up splitting our dogs so we'd get a good sampling, and it was delicious. The foie gras dog was a new experience for me, as I'd never actually had foie gras before. But it was good. The service was excellent. The cashier was very friendly and thorough and patient, which made the experience so much better and worth the wait. Pros: variety of dogs, reasonable prices, friendly service, delicious food. Con: long wait (but worth it!)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
