I highly recommend doing the full tour, which takes about 4 hours. Everything about Alinea is over the top, in a good way. I've eaten here twice (about a year apart) and each experience was equally as phenomenal. The food and its presentation are works of art. Service is beyond exceptional (you have a team of people really). Agree with other reviewers that if you are more of a \"Maggiano's\" type, you might not like this place. It is quite expensive. I took my husband there for his birthday and we did the full tour with partial wine and beer pairings and our bill with tip was about $800. If you go when they have the bacon donuts, consider yourself lucky. Once you eat here, pretty much every other high-end restaurant in the city will seem just ok. Highly highly recommended at least once.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
