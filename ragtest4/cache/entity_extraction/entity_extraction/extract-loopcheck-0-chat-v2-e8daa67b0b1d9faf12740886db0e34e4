Alinea offers an unforgettable experience that is more like going to a culinary theater. Dinner was 4 hours long. We had 25 courses which included oxtail, halibut, cotton candy, and sorbet (like Dippin' Dots but in unique flavors like mango and cayenne pepper that melt in your mouth - they made you guess what the 7 different flavors were). All the dishes were presented in some unique apparatus. There was a bacon dish where the bacon hung like a hammock. There was a bubblegum flavored syrup that you drank out of a giant test tube. Each course had a unique twist that you can't find anywhere else. The atmosphere and the service were also excellent. They also offer wine pairings with each course. The only downside is that it's really expensive (as other reviewers mentioned). The \"tour\" which is 25 courses is $225 (plus wine, tax, tip) while the \"tasting\" is 12 courses for $145. Also, I made the reservations two months in advance. We all thought it was worth it (and I'm not just saying that cause I feel stupid having spent that much on dinner!).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for offering a unique culinary experience that resembles a theatrical performance with multiple courses and innovative presentations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>The dinner at Alinea is a lengthy experience lasting 4 hours, featuring 25 courses with various unique dishes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXTail<|>LOCATION<|>Oxtail is one of the dishes served during the dinner at Alinea, showcasing the restaurant's diverse menu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALIBUT<|>LOCATION<|>Halibut is another dish included in the 25-course dinner at Alinea, highlighting the seafood offerings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COTTON CANDY<|>LOCATION<|>Cotton candy is creatively presented as part of the dining experience at Alinea, emphasizing the restaurant's innovative approach.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SORBET<|>LOCATION<|>Sorbet is served in unique flavors during the dinner at Alinea, contributing to the overall experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUBBLEGUM FLAVORED SYRUP<|>LOCATION<|>Bubblegum flavored syrup is a unique drink served in a giant test tube at Alinea, showcasing the restaurant's creativity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRINGS<|>EVENT<|>Wine pairings are offered with each course at Alinea, enhancing the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESERVATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Reservations at Alinea must be made two months in advance due to the restaurant's popularity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>DINNER<|>Alinea hosts a unique dinner experience that lasts 4 hours and includes 25 courses.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>OXTail<|>Oxtail is one of the dishes served during the dinner at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>HALIBUT<|>Halibut is another dish featured in the 25-course dinner at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>COTTON CANDY<|>Cotton candy is creatively included in the dinner experience at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>SORBET<|>Sorbet is served as part of the unique dining experience at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>BUBBLEGUM FLAVORED SYRUP<|>Bubblegum flavored syrup is a unique drink served during the dinner at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>WINE PAIRINGS<|>Wine pairings are offered with each course during the dinner at Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>RESERVATIONS<|>Reservations must be made two months in advance to dine at Alinea.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
