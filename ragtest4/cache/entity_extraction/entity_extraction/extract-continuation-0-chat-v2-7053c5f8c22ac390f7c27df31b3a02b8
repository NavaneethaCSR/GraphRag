It's good, but it's also just a hotdog...i didn't think it tasted any more spectacular than any other specialized hot dog joint. Not worth standing in line for 30-45 minutes (random Monday). Ordered 2 hotdogs for myself (1 special & 1 regular chicago-style dog): 1) Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ($9): 2 stars. This sounded good...so good that almost the entire group ordered this as one of the two dogs to eat. I was not a fan, & neither was the rest of my group. It was way too rich (& I normally like rich). But I felt like it wasn't that flavorful..just creamy, fatty, & slightly bland. 2) Chicago-Style Hot Dog ($2): 4 stars. I liked this $2 dog better than my $9 special dog. I had it with \"everything\" topping & dog deep fried & grilled. \"Simple\", yet flavorful & tasty...can't really go wrong w/ your typical dog. 3) Had a bite of my friend's rattlesnake dog (daily special)...ok this \"dog\" was AMAZING (5 stars for this one). It was topped with dried fried onions & was bursting w/ flavor. I couldn't tell it was rattlesnake over any other meat, b/c it tasted just like any other hot dog, but it was the toppings and sauces that made the delish flavor. ORDER this if it's available. Sides: Unfortunately, no duck-fat fries on week days. We ordered an order of regular fries to share. They were good, but nothing special. Just your typical thick-cut steak fries.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOTDOG<|>EVENT<|>A type of food item that is being reviewed in the context of a restaurant experience...)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO-STYLE HOT DOG<|>EVENT<|>A specific type of hot dog that is being compared favorably to a more expensive special hot dog in the review...)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIE GRAS AND SAUTERNES DUCK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A special hot dog that was ordered but found to be too rich and lacking in flavor by the reviewer...)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RATTLESNAKE DOG<|>EVENT<|>A daily special hot dog that received high praise for its flavor and toppings...)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIES<|>EVENT<|>A side dish ordered alongside the hot dogs, described as typical and not special...)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVIEWER<|>PERSON<|>The individual providing the review and personal opinions on the hot dogs and sides they ordered...)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVIEWER<|>CHICAGO-STYLE HOT DOG<|>The reviewer had a positive experience with the Chicago-style hot dog, rating it 4 stars.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVIEWER<|>FOIE GRAS AND SAUTERNES DUCK SAUSAGE<|>The reviewer had a negative experience with the foie gras hot dog, rating it only 2 stars.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVIEWER<|>RATTLESNAKE DOG<|>The reviewer had a very positive experience with the rattlesnake dog, rating it 5 stars.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVIEWER<|>FRIES<|>The reviewer found the fries to be typical and not special, indicating a neutral experience.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO-STYLE HOT DOG<|>FOIE GRAS AND SAUTERNES DUCK SAUSAGE<|>The reviewer compared the Chicago-style hot dog favorably against the foie gras hot dog.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RATTLESNAKE DOG<|>FOIE GRAS AND SAUTERNES DUCK SAUSAGE<|>The rattlesnake dog was praised in contrast to the foie gras hot dog, highlighting its superior flavor.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
