We had to come here on a Friday because we HAD to have the duck fries (offered only Fridays and Saturdays) and we got there early because we heard the line starts forming right away. We sat in our car before the doors opened at 10:30 am, and couldn't help but notice all the other people sitting in their cars as well - could they also be waiting for the doors to open? Yes, they were, because at 10:25, car doors started opening and people started queuing. Here's why: It's not just the ketchup red and mustard yellow decor, and it's not the fact that Hot Doug himself (he looks like the Verizon guy's brother) is manning the counter with a steady patter, it is the fact that Doug has raised the hot dog into a culinary art form that includes kangaroo sausages and one made of a mixture of elk, venison, antelope and buffalo. That's what I had: The Mountain Man! It tasted better than elk, venison, antelope and buffalo ought to taste in encased meat form, it was transcendant! Complex, smoky, not gamey at all. My friend Jeanne got the Jack Daniels Fennel Pork Sausage (I had a bite - tast-ee!), and my pal Marc got the Foie Gras Sauterne Duck Sausage and a regular Hot Doug, just so we could taste the snap of their regular dogs. Some people have issues with foie gras, and I didn't know where I stood on that debate until I had a taste of Marc's Foie Gras Duck Sausage. I am now pro foie gras. And the duck fat fries? Phat! Crispy! Thinly sliced! Colors ranging from golden to caramel brown, skins still on them, and again...transcendent. Someone told us that Chicago does regular food raised to an art form better than any other city in the world, and this is a shining example.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
