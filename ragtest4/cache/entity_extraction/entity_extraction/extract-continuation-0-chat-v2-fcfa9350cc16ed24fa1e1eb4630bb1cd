Hands down. Chicago-style hot dog? On the menu. Venison sausage? On the menu. Elk sausage? On the menu. I know what you're thinking, but it was absolutely fabulous. The inside is super small and fully decorated with almost every kind of hot dog and sausage-related signs and decor you can imagine. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes to just order our food. I definitely wouldn't call this place \"fast\" food by any means, but I think it's worth the wait. You're not allowed to sit down until after you order. Surprisingly enough, the tables turn over pretty quickly so no one is ever with food and without a seat. Once you place your order, it comes out fast and you consume it fast. I guess that's where the \"fast\" in the \"fast food\" saying comes from. The food is really good and it's fairly cheap too. I highly recommend the corn dog and the elk sausage. Also, get the duck fat fries. The bigger-sized fries are not that far off from regular fries, but the smaller-sized fries are unreal. I. Could. Not. Stop. Eating. Them. It was bad.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a popular eatery known for its variety of hot dogs and sausages, including Chicago-style hot dogs and unique options like venison and elk sausages.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in Illinois, known for its culinary scene, including famous hot dog establishments like Hot Doug's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORN DOG<|>EVENT<|>The corn dog is a popular menu item at Hot Doug's, recommended for its taste.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Duck fat fries are a specialty side dish at Hot Doug's, noted for their exceptional flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>Elk sausage is one of the unique offerings at Hot Doug's, praised for its fabulous taste.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORDER<|>VERB<|>The action of customers placing their food orders at Hot Doug's before being seated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAIT<|>VERB<|>The action of customers waiting for their turn to order at Hot Doug's, which can take an hour and fifteen minutes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO<|>Hot Doug's is located in Chicago, contributing to the city's reputation for diverse culinary offerings.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CORN DOG<|>The corn dog is a recommended menu item at Hot Doug's, highlighting its popularity among customers.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>Duck fat fries are a specialty side dish at Hot Doug's, known for their exceptional taste.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ELK SAUSAGE<|>Elk sausage is one of the unique and praised offerings at Hot Doug's.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORDER<|>WAIT<|>Customers must wait to place their order at Hot Doug's, indicating a process that involves both actions.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
