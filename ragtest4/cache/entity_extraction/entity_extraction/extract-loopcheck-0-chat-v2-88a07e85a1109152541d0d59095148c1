Spectacular. Really. Worth the money, lives up to the hype. Grant Achatz is a rock star, as far as I'm concerned. I found the cuisine inspired, the menu innovative and filled with humor, the flavors bright and complex, and the sensory experience delightful on all accounts. The staff were warm and unpretentious. I won't regale you with details of my 28-course Tour, but suffice it to say, this was the most magnificent culinary experience I have ever had...in any country. I will certainly be taking a pilgrimage to El Bulli in San Sebastian before it closes in 2012, if only to experience for myself the place from which Chef Achatz has sprung. I dined at Alinea as part of my culinary tour of Chicago - it put Charlie Trotter's to shame. I will definitely visit again during a different season.
