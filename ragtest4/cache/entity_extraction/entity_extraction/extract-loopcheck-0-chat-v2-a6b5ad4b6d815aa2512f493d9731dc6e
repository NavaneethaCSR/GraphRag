I have been there at least 7 times and it seems to get better each time. On my first visit I I waited in the line for two hours and it was worth every minute (if the line wraps around to the alley/dumpsters expect about a two hour wait). In fact, after the first hour I said to my roommate, \"This wait better be worth it...\" After another hour in line and then eating our meal, I felt bad for even questioning it. But don't worry, the line isn't always that long. If you can go on a weekday before the lunch rush, the wait can be a matter of minutes. Make sure to try a specialty sausage. If I am with a friend we usually each order a different one and then split them. The regular dogs and the \"fire dog\" are always great as well. If you go on Friday and Saturday and fail to order the duck fat fries, there might just be something loose in your brain. If you think that pork fat tastes good (think bacon and smile), then duck fat will be right up your alley. Different flavors, but the same savory experience. If you stick with a dog and fries, it is a pretty cheap meal. Once you venture into the wonderful world of specialty sausages, the costs begin to rise. But, just as the wait, the cost is worth it. And finally, the rumors about the tattoo are true! I asked Doug and he told me that if you get the Hot Doug's logo tattoo, you get free Hot Doug's for life. The Rules: 1. It has to be big enough (check with Doug for actual size requirements). 2. Doug won't always ask to see it, but when he does, you have to be ready to show it. 3. You get your food for free, not the people who you bring with you. 4. You do not get to skip the line, as Doug says, \"That's crazy talk.\"\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a city known for its vibrant food scene, including popular spots for specialty sausages and hot dogs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a well-known eatery in Chicago famous for its specialty sausages and hot dogs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUG<|>PERSON<|>Doug is the owner of Hot Doug's, known for his unique offerings and the tattoo promotion for free food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPECIALTY SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>The act of trying different specialty sausages at Hot Doug's, which enhances the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>A popular side dish at Hot Doug's that is highly recommended for its unique flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRE DOG<|>EVENT<|>A specific type of hot dog offered at Hot Doug's, known for its spicy flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TATTOO<|>EVENT<|>A promotional event where customers can get a tattoo of Hot Doug's logo to receive free food for life.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO<|>Hot Doug's is a prominent restaurant located in Chicago, contributing to the city's culinary reputation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOUG<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Doug is the owner of Hot Doug's, directly associated with its operations and promotions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPECIALTY SAUSAGE<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Specialty sausages are a key offering at Hot Doug's, attracting customers to the restaurant.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Duck fat fries are a signature side dish at Hot Doug's, enhancing the overall dining experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRE DOG<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The fire dog is a popular menu item at Hot Doug's, known for its unique taste.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TATTOO<|>DOUG<|>The tattoo promotion is managed by Doug, who offers free food for life to customers who get the tattoo.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
