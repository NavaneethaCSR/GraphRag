I refused to book my plane tickets for my high school friend's wedding before I got a reservation. And I apologize for my co-workers who had to listen to me for 4 hours of repeated calling, groaning at the busy signal, and repeating that over and over again until I finally got through (clearly I will not be winning any employee of the year awards). I loved almost everything except for a course that featured English peas. Can't quite put my finger on what it was that I didn't like about it, because I do enjoy peas, but in comparison to the other stellar bites of food I had, this one just didn't do it for me. Service was spectacular - I love how unobtrusive the servers are. They seemed to anticipate when I would need them without making me feel like they were peering over my shoulder during the 4-ish hours we dined there. We got the wine pairings, which were the equivalent of about 4-5 glasses of wine. I must be a lightweight because I was having quite a time staying upright on the red line back to my hotel. Whoops. Oh, and definitely do not lick the Yuzu Snow. My husband and I were warned to not do so because it is really super cold, and there's a chance of getting your tongue stuck. GUESS WHO GOT HIS TONGUE STUCK. Ahem. I'm definitely not naming names, but I'm glad he was able to get his tongue unstuck before we had to call for help.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
