Hot Doug's and I started our affair exactly a year ago. I came on MLK Day and I am happy to announce that the sausage emporium only gets better with age. It was a gorgeous 45 degrees and the wait was maybe 45 minutes, too. Raul B. helped me pass the time in the line and we ended up splitting a large Cheese Fry, which I washed down with my Birch Bark Beer. I still can't wait to try Duck Fat Fries, but I have yet to return on a Friday or Saturday. That's OK, I've got Doug's encased meats to keep me satisfied when I do show up. This time I ordered the Merguez Lamb Sausage with Spicy Harissa and Haloumi Cheese. It wasn't extremely spicy, but it had a nice bite to it. I really enjoyed the cilantro sauce! Since not everyone is as willing to schlep from the burbs for ground lamb as I am, Joanne W. and I made a deal that I'd bring her back a dog if she picked up cupcakes for me. She requested the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel, and I'm happy to report that from 1-9pm (after a drive then being put in the fridge and chilling in the car) it held up better than a Dolly Parton facelift.
