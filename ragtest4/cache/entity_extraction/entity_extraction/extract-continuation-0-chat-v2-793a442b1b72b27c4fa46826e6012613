To negate this public perception I decided to turn my visit into a grueling affair, forcing Doug's to gain my appreciation only by overshadowing a terrible experience getting in. Naturally, Chicago offers this opportunity. I waited for close to an hour and a half outside of Doug's in the atmospheric physics paradox that is a 30 degree rain shower complemented by a steady 40 mph horizontal wind. After entering, I was thoroughly miserable and perfectly primed for discarding the restaurant as \"not worth the wait.\" The cashier was too friendly and upbeat to possibly understand the state his thawing customers are in when they enter but he assured me I would leave sated, warm, and happy. This man knew his customers as well as Hot Doug's knows encased meats! I had a Chicago style classic as well as the weekend only duck fat fries and a rattlesnake dog and everything was fantastic! The fully loaded Chicago style was spot on and surprisingly competitively priced (I expect inflated prices at these cult institutions). The chardonnay & jalapeno rattlesnake sausage with chili garlic mayo and smoked gouda had just the right amount of heat and a unique gaminess to make it something truly special and worth the $8 price point. I also tried a bite of a companion's foie gras and duck sausage which was delicious but too rich to eat alone. The only thing that didn't live up to the hype were the duck fat fries. They were great hand-cut fries that stand above most others but didn't have the decadence that I expected. Thank goodness the weather is changing because although it is totally worth it I still won't look forward to a frigid waiting line...\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a popular restaurant in Chicago known for its gourmet encased meats and unique hot dog offerings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in Illinois, known for its vibrant food scene and cultural attractions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUG<|>PERSON<|>Doug is the owner or operator of Hot Doug's, recognized for his customer service and knowledge of the restaurant's offerings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO STYLE CLASSIC<|>EVENT<|>The Chicago style classic is a signature dish at Hot Doug's, featuring a hot dog prepared in the traditional Chicago style.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Duck fat fries are a specialty side dish offered at Hot Doug's, known for their unique flavor and preparation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RATTLESNAKE DOG<|>EVENT<|>The rattlesnake dog is a unique hot dog option at Hot Doug's, made with rattlesnake sausage and served with special toppings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIE GRAS AND DUCK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>Foie gras and duck sausage is a gourmet dish offered at Hot Doug's, known for its rich flavor.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOUG<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Doug is the owner/operator of Hot Doug's, contributing to its reputation and customer experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO<|>Hot Doug's is located in Chicago, contributing to the city's culinary landscape.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO STYLE CLASSIC<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The Chicago style classic is a signature dish served at Hot Doug's, showcasing the restaurant's specialty.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Duck fat fries are a popular side dish at Hot Doug's, enhancing the dining experience.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RATTLESNAKE DOG<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The rattlesnake dog is a unique offering at Hot Doug's, highlighting the restaurant's creative menu.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOIE GRAS AND DUCK SAUSAGE<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Foie gras and duck sausage is a gourmet dish available at Hot Doug's, known for its richness.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
