I had ridiculous expectations. I've been to Schwa, L20, Tru, Next, Bonsoiree and Moto (you can say I love to eat out) and I'm a New York transplant (I proudly ate through New York the 5 years I lived there). And I have to say, I've never had such a beautifully crafted, wonderfully executed, ridiculously ingenious, tasty and elegant meal in my life. From the start of the meal (lifting the pumpkin centerpiece to reveal that little morsel inside) to the end (smashing that chocolate egg over a modern art sauce landscape), it was fabulous. Yes, it costs an arm and a leg to dine here. And yes, you will be uncomfortably full by the time you get out (and it may be almost 1am since the only reservation you could score was a 9pm on a Sunday), but for a special occasion, it is just the place to go.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHWA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Schwa is a renowned restaurant known for its innovative and high-quality dining experiences in Chicago.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L20<|>ORGANIZATION<|>L20 is a fine dining restaurant in Chicago that offers a unique culinary experience with a focus on seasonal ingredients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tru is a high-end restaurant in Chicago known for its exquisite cuisine and elegant atmosphere.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEXT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Next is a restaurant in Chicago that features a changing menu based on different themes and cuisines.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BONSOIREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bonsoiree is a restaurant in Chicago that offers a creative and modern take on classic dishes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moto is a Chicago-based restaurant known for its avant-garde approach to food and dining.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a major city in the United States known for its diverse culinary scene and vibrant culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1AM<|>EVENT<|>The time indicating when the dining experience may conclude, highlighting the late reservation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>9PM<|>EVENT<|>The time of the reservation that reflects the popularity and demand for dining at the restaurant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUMPKIN CENTERPIECE<|>LOCATION<|>A decorative element used in the meal presentation that adds to the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE EGG<|>LOCATION<|>A dessert element in the meal that is part of the creative presentation and experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODERN ART SAUCE LANDSCAPE<|>LOCATION<|>A creative sauce presentation that enhances the visual appeal of the dessert.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHWA<|>NEW YORK<|>The reviewer is a New York transplant, indicating a connection to the culinary experiences in New York.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>L20<|>NEW YORK<|>The reviewer has likely experienced fine dining in New York, comparing it to L20.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRU<|>NEW YORK<|>The reviewer compares their experiences at Tru to those in New York, indicating a high standard.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEXT<|>NEW YORK<|>The reviewer’s experiences in New York may influence their perception of Next.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BONSOIREE<|>NEW YORK<|>The reviewer’s culinary background from New York may shape their view of Bonsoiree.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTO<|>NEW YORK<|>The reviewer’s experiences in New York may lead to comparisons with Moto.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1AM<|>9PM<|>The late reservation time of 9 PM leads to a dining experience that may end around 1 AM.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUMPKIN CENTERPIECE<|>CHOCOLATE EGG<|>Both elements are part of the meal presentation, enhancing the dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOCOLATE EGG<|>MODERN ART SAUCE LANDSCAPE<|>The chocolate egg is presented over the modern art sauce landscape, creating a visual and culinary connection.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PUMPKIN CENTERPIECE<|>MODERN ART SAUCE LANDSCAPE<|>The pumpkin centerpiece and modern art sauce landscape are both integral to the meal's presentation.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
