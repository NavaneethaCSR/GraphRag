(If you're into the whole gastronomy scene.) But the presentation, staff and atmosphere were completely pretentious and pompous. The arrogant waiters really took away from the experience of our meal. When you pay $700+ for dinner - you expect to be treated like a king/queen not like a pauper by patronizing waiters! One of the waiters argued with my boyfriend about white and black not being a colors because he learned that in 1st grade. My boyfriend then asked him if something he had learned in grammar school went with what an adult male had learned until now. He got really defensive and then never came back to our table. My boyfriend is a loose cannon and can be confrontational with people that try to make him feel like an idiot. The sommelier also gets extremely close to your face while presenting the wine pairings and that was pretty annoying. This place reminds me of some hip club that everyone tries to get into and when you finally do - it blows and you can't wait to leave.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOYFRIEND<|>PERSON<|>The boyfriend of the narrator who accompanied her to the restaurant and engaged in a confrontation with a waiter.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAITERS<|>PERSON<|>The staff members at the restaurant who were perceived as arrogant and pretentious, affecting the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOMMELIER<|>PERSON<|>A staff member at the restaurant responsible for presenting wine pairings, whose behavior was considered intrusive.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The establishment where the narrator and her boyfriend dined, known for its gastronomy scene but criticized for its service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>The dining experience that cost over $700, which the narrator expected to be exceptional but was marred by poor service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GASTRONOMY SCENE<|>GEO<|>A cultural context referring to the high-end culinary experiences that the restaurant is part of.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESENTATION<|>VERB<|>The act of the sommelier presenting wine pairings to the diners, which was described as intrusive.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOYFRIEND<|>WAITERS<|>The boyfriend had a confrontation with the waiters regarding a discussion about colors, leading to a negative interaction.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAITERS<|>RESTAURANT<|>The waiters are employees of the restaurant, contributing to the overall dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOMMELIER<|>RESTAURANT<|>The sommelier is a staff member at the restaurant responsible for wine pairings, impacting the dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>RESTAURANT<|>The dinner took place at the restaurant, which was expected to provide a high-quality experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>BOYFRIEND<|>The dinner experience involved the boyfriend, who played a significant role in the events that unfolded.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GASTRONOMY SCENE<|>RESTAURANT<|>The restaurant is part of the gastronomy scene, which the narrator references in her critique.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
