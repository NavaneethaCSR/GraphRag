They do shorter (around 12 - 14 courses / 2 - 3 hours) and longer (around 22 - 28 courses / 4 - 6 hours) tasting menus. For me, it was more about the experience than the food and Alinea definitely lived up to the expectations set by its 5-star Yelp rating. Food: I had the 26-course tour with wine pairings and while it was tasty and artistic, I was in a food coma for a day or two after! I probably should have gone with a shorter tour. As some other reviewers have noted, the focus at Alinea is on the experience first and the taste second, which isn't to say the food is less than great but, with 26 dishes, some are much better than others. Chef Grant Achatz and his excellent kitchen staff play with texture, color, scent, and taste and deconstruct and reinterpret more common dishes. The menu, which changes regularly, often features interesting and surprising combinations (lamb and chocolate, or bacon and candy). They take full advantage of the large number of dishes to make the eater interact with the food in different ways (eat meat off a wire; suck mousse from a tube or liquid from a sphere). The result is a fun culinary voyage. Side note on the wine pairings: wow! Dinner for two, with wine, was around $900. 4 stars. Service: The wait staff is extremely attentive and when engaged became quite friendly, which made for a better experience. I left after 1 AM, after a five hour meal, and think there were two or three waiters devoted to my table for the last few hours. Also, they give you a copy of the menu to help you remember it all! 5 stars. Decor: Relatively open and airy and spread out over two stories. For some reason Alinea reminded me of a nice but cold home. I sat upstairs in a room a bit too quiet and private for my taste. Definitely spend a few minutes in the kitchen, watching masters at work. 4 stars. Summary: Food (60% weight for Overall): 4 stars. Service (20% weight for Overall): 5 stars. Decor (20% weight for Overall): 4 stars. Overall: 4.2 (rounded up to 5 because of the overall Alinea experience) stars. Very good, interesting, and innovative food and an amazing overall experience.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a highly-praised Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative tasting menus and unique dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANT ACHATZ<|>PERSON<|>Grant Achatz is the chef of Alinea, recognized for his creative culinary techniques and artistic presentations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>Dinner at Alinea involves a multi-course tasting menu that emphasizes experience and interaction with food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRINGS<|>EVENT<|>Wine pairings at Alinea enhance the dining experience, complementing the various courses served.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The service at Alinea is characterized by attentive and friendly wait staff who enhance the overall dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECOR<|>EVENT<|>The decor of Alinea is described as open, airy, and spread over two stories, contributing to the restaurant's ambiance.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRANT ACHATZ<|>ALINEA<|>Grant Achatz is the chef responsible for the innovative culinary experiences at Alinea.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>DINNER<|>Dinner at Alinea is a key event that showcases the restaurant's unique tasting menus and overall experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>WINE PAIRINGS<|>Wine pairings are an integral part of the dining experience at Alinea, enhancing the flavors of the dishes served.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SERVICE<|>The attentive service at Alinea contributes significantly to the overall dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>DECOR<|>The decor of Alinea creates an inviting atmosphere that complements the dining experience.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
