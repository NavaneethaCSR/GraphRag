I had made reservations every night at different restaurants around Chicago, David Burkes Prime House, Gibsons, Ditkas, The Chophouse, Gene and Georgetta's. I missed this place but met a woman at The Peninsula who sells them their loose tea. She got us reservations the next day. We were only able to do the 12 course, however we went out with our smellier the next evening drinking and drinking some more. He got me another reservation the next evening for a 24 course that I took my mother to. She enjoyed it very much and was amazed. She does not drink so our Sommelier paired different flavored ciders and hot teas to accomodate her. Very Classy. Liquified carrot was a favorite. The frozen ball in orange water explodes in your mouth with an assortment of flavors I cannot begin to explain. Yes Expensive but definetly worth it.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
