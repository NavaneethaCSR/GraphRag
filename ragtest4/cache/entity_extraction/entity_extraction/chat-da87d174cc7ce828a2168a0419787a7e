The longest I'd ever waited in line for a hot dog was 5 minutes. That was till I visited Hot Doug's. I spent $23 on a hot dog lunch and waited in line for over an hour to get it. Lucky was I to have a fun group of Yelpers to entertained me while I waited. I could not have braved the line by myself. Having spent my entire lunch break standing in line, I grabbed my Foie Gras, my Game of the Day and my Salma Hayek (a hot dog, not the actress), and hightailed it back to the office. The plan was to wait until I got back to my desk to enjoy the dogs. Unfortunately, I just couldn't last that long. The aromas emanating from my meal were irresistible. I was taking huge bites of the foie gras while stopped at traffic lights. It was a really good hot dog but was overshadowed by my favorite: the Game of the Day. This red wine demi-glace venison dog, topped with fig goat's butter and raclette cheese, was truly delightful. The andouille sausage Salma Hayek, so called because like the actress it's hot and spicy, was also very tasty. So I bet you are wondering whether the price and the long wait at Hot Doug's were worth it. Absolutely! I would do it again in a heartbeat if I could have the same kind of company in line with me.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
