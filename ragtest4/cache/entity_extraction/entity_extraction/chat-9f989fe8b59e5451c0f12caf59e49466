Except, after travelling around the U.S. for the past several months and eating at some terrific places (Blue Duck Tavern, Redd, Cochon, Zuni Cafe, Slanted Door, Luke for starters) not one tops Alinea. So much better than any Tom Keller place. Yes expensive, but you can be assured that you will have a truly amazing dining experience. The food: not everything works but so much does and your taste buds and brain never get tired of anything. It's like you are on a food adventure with the chef. I worried before going about the overhandling/preciousness/food science over just simple enjoyment of good food. But the chef's touch is just right--bringing out the best of each item you eat, finding impossibly wonderful combinations of flavors, textures, and temperatures. Most importantly, you trust the chef to deliver no matter what you are eating. The wine: amazing pairings! Wines I might never have tasted and each went absolutely seamlessly with the food. Service: outstanding. Don't judge a book by its cover--much of the wait staff look a tad scruffy with sloppy facial hair, haircuts, and ill fitting suits. But all were incredibly impressive. Amazing balance between being very professional but not off putting, knowledgeable (especially the sommelier) and warm while leaving you space to enjoy your meal. You feel appropriately watched over but also comfortable enjoying your experience. If you could only pick one place in the U.S. to have your most memorable meal, this would be THE place.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
