Everyone who raves about this place can't admit to themselves that it wasn't that good because it would undermine their ego. How could they just have waited in line for something that was just a hot dog. They can't. It's unfathomable. They are too in-the-know and culturally savvy to have been duped by consumerist fervor. They really did their research and KNOW that duck fat fries taste better. Guess what, you couldn't tell the difference if they didn't tell you. It's not all bad. In fact the hot dogs are ok. This place is fun and quirky. Different meats and toppings that are interesting. It's like a baskin robbins for hot dogs. It should also be like baskin robbins, or any other hot dog shop, and be fast. Superdawg, Herm's, Poochie's, Jean and Jude's, all make as good if not better hot dogs. You also don't have to wait 45 minutes listening to the people around you explaining to their friends and repeating to themselves that it's worth the wait. This is the mantra of the egoist foodie. They are suffering to experience something that others are not willing to suffer. With this suffering will come a superior product. It's the same thing people waiting outside night clubs tell themselves. It's not worth the wait. If you want a hot dog guess what? You're in Chicago! You can get the best hot dogs in the world pretty much anywhere. Another commodity are Bratwurst and Weisswurst. The original gourmet encased meat that's just not marketed correctly to the post-modern foodie. Weisswurst: Ground milk fed veal and minced pork belly sausage spiced with parsley, lemon, mace, onions, ginger, and cardamom. Served hot and topped with caramelized onions and stone ground mustard. Sounds amazing right. They serve it at most any German place.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
