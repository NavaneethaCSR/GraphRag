I am a bit of a picky eater, so I was a little nervous about the tasting menu. There was really no problem though because they will easily accommodate dietary restrictions. My husband and I don't eat pork, so we mentioned it ahead of time and they were sure to make a couple of adjustments for us. I also noticed that a woman nearby was a vegetarian, and for each course that included meat they would bring her something different. The service at Alinea was amazing. There seem to be more waiters than diners. One thing that I really appreciated was their occasional instructions on how to eat a course. Some courses are brought out in special serving dishes created just for Alinea. The food is presented in such an artistic way and some of the actual serving dishes are equally artistic. It's nice to have reassurance about how exactly you should eat a couple of the courses. The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. I don't really want to ruin this surprise, but it's a gorgeous display of sweets on the table that is also super delicious! While I enjoyed most of the dinner courses (I just don't like some flavors - nothing was prepared poorly), I completely loved every bite of dessert! One last thing, prepare to be there for a while. It's a long meal with all those courses. You don't want to be sleepy during the grand finale!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative tasting menu and exceptional service, accommodating dietary restrictions for its guests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUSBAND<|>PERSON<|>The husband of the narrator who accompanied her to Alinea to celebrate a special occasion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOMAN<|>PERSON<|>A nearby female diner at Alinea who is a vegetarian and received special accommodations for her dietary preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESSERT<|>EVENT<|>The highlight of the meal at Alinea, featuring a visually stunning and delicious display of sweets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEAL<|>EVENT<|>A long dining experience at Alinea consisting of multiple courses, including special instructions on how to enjoy them.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIETARY RESTRICTIONS<|>EVENT<|>The accommodations made by Alinea for guests with specific dietary needs, such as avoiding pork or meat.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAND FINALE<|>EVENT<|>The final part of the meal at Alinea, which is particularly emphasized as a significant and enjoyable experience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUSBAND<|>ALINEA<|>The husband accompanied the narrator to Alinea to celebrate a special occasion, indicating a personal connection to the restaurant.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOMAN<|>ALINEA<|>The woman was served a special vegetarian meal at Alinea, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to accommodating dietary preferences.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DESSERT<|>MEAL<|>The dessert is a significant part of the meal at Alinea, noted as the highlight of the dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIETARY RESTRICTIONS<|>ALINEA<|>Alinea made adjustments to the menu to accommodate the dietary restrictions of the narrator and her husband.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAND FINALE<|>MEAL<|>The grand finale refers to the concluding part of the meal, emphasizing its importance in the overall dining experience.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
