I can't stop waiving about this place. It's a shabby little place in a shabby little neighborhood. From downtown, it's about a $20 cab ride. If you ask me, that's worth it for A quality hot dogs. The bf got 3 hotdogs for himself. I forget the names and all were very good and juicy. The service was quick and the manager was very nice and sweet. We came here on a weekday so we didn't get to try the duck fat fries (avail Fri&Sat ONLY). Oh well, more reasons to come back to Chi town. I ordered the foie gras duck hot dog with white truffle aioli. It's about 3x the cost of the other hot dogs which are about $2-3 each but it is so worth it. The foie gras was not seared, which disappointed me at first. However, after one bite of the dog and I knew why. When the foie gras is seared, the texture of it becomes a little firmer and therefore, does not melt in your mouth as quickly. By not searing it, you are ensuring that the foie gras melt in your melt with the juice of the duck sausage. With the addition of the truffle aioli, the combination is just superb. AHHHH, what a superb combination. I wished LA had something like this. I've said it once and I'm not afraid to say it again. The foie gras hot dog with the duck sausage and white truffle aioli is the best hot dog I've ever had. Hands down. A friendly reminder - this place is cash only. Not sure if they have an ATM machine, but bring lots of cash! You'll want 2nds! Very friendly service. A little smelly though, from the grease. All worth it for the best hot dog I've ever had.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
