SO, despite us being a little disappointed in our dinner, I recognize that the expectation was SO HIGH, that Alinea could have never met it. Also: be prepared for price. Our dinner was $1100 when it was all said and done. 5 stars all the way for the food and knowledge of the wait staff. Incredible. Few rules to follow: 1. Keep your imagination in check! The food is great, but it won't change your life. 2. Wine pairing: STAY AWAY!! It's not worth the price, especially for the Reserve Pairing which we opted for. Fellow Yelpers were spot-on with this. 3. Don't come with alot of conversation topics for your fellow diners: The atmosphere is very quiet, and somewhat cold. Focus on the food and you'll be good to go. I will never go back to Alinea, because frankly I cannot afford it, but I'm so happy we chose to experience it once in our lives.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences and high-quality food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>The dining experience at Alinea, which was expensive and met with high expectations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAIT STAFF<|>PERSON<|>The knowledgeable staff at Alinea who provide service during the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>EVENT<|>The option of pairing wine with the meal, which was advised against due to high costs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>ALINEA<|>The dinner experience took place at Alinea, highlighting the restaurant's food quality and service.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAIT STAFF<|>ALINEA<|>The wait staff at Alinea are integral to the dining experience, providing knowledge and service.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>DINNER<|>The wine pairing was part of the dinner experience, but it was deemed not worth the price.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>WAIT STAFF<|>The wait staff contributed to the overall experience of the dinner at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
