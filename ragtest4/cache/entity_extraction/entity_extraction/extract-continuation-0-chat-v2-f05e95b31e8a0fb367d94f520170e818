We ordered the Tour menu (20+ courses) and a reduced wine pairing for two people. Yeah, it was expensive. Really expensive. Almost as much as my rent. But as a wannabe foodie, it was worth every penny. It's as much an experience as a meal, and I never wanted it to end...until the final course, which ended the meal on such a note that I finally felt ready to go. Even the wine pairings were awesome, illuminating different types I had never even heard of. Service was amazing and attentive, while still being friendly and not stuffy.
