After coming here last Friday before Doug closed for the next two weeks. I usually get the foie gras dog and a Thuringer or brat-something off the permanent menu and something off the special menu but the Hot Sauce Chicken Sausage with \"Buffalo\" Mustard and Smoked Moody Blue Cheese seemed interesting. I asked him if it was good and he said it was-not that I expect him to say no, it's disgusting and I can't wait to get rid of it. It WAS good though, with the blue cheese it reminded me a lot like a buffalo wing. I went Thuringer this time which was as delicious as ever with some mustard and onions-always a good call. I like the bratwurst but sometimes it can be hit or miss the Thuringer is not as tasty as a good brat here but it's more consistent. I also tried the 30 sausage chili which is really huge, a lot of sausage actually and quite filling but okay.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
