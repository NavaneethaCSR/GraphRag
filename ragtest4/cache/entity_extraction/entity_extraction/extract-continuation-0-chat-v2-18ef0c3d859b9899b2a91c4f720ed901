I think I am rating it five stars just because it is just as good as everyone says! I went with three other friends. I would suggest going with this many people because it means you can try more different types! We ordered the following: Duck sausage and foie gras - my fav! they really are generous with the foie gras and if that is not rich enough, they top it off with a little creamy sauce...YUM! Smoked crayfish and pork sausage - I know it doesn't sound that good, but this was suprisingly delicious! It was my second fav, it comes topped with a generous topping of goat cheese, and the combination of flavors will wow you!! I was actually least excited to try this one, and it turned out being one of the best ones!! Smoked Portuguese Linguica - a little spicy, comes with some yummy sauce, you can't go wrong with this one either if you are looking for a sausage with a spicy and different flavor Ginger spiked rabbit sausage - wasn't gamey at all, not sure if it is was because it was ginger spiked but it just tasted kinda weird to me, one bite was enough for this one. Chicken and spinach sausage - sounds boring but it was really good! Can't go wrong with this one either. And the polish and chili dogs were your run of the mill hot dogs, still tasty but definitely overshadowed by the other crazy flavors! And we got THREE orders of duck fat fries. Not sure if it was because I knew they were fried in duck fat but they seem extra good to me, slightly crispy on the outside, a little mushy on the inside. I even ate a lot of them without ketchup!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in the United States where the narrator lived for almost seven years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a restaurant known for its gourmet hot dogs and sausages, highly rated by customers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK SAUSAGE AND FOIE GRAS<|>EVENT<|>A dish served at Hot Doug's that combines duck sausage with foie gras, praised for its richness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKED CRAYFISH AND PORK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A dish at Hot Doug's that features smoked crayfish and pork sausage, noted for its surprising deliciousness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKED PORTUGUESE LINGUICA<|>EVENT<|>A spicy sausage dish served at Hot Doug's, accompanied by a flavorful sauce.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER SPIKED RABBIT SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A unique sausage dish at Hot Doug's that is flavored with ginger, described as tasting weird.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN AND SPINACH SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A dish at Hot Doug's that combines chicken and spinach, considered surprisingly good.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Fries fried in duck fat, served at Hot Doug's, noted for their extra flavor and crispy texture.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Hot Doug's is a restaurant located in Chicago, where the narrator enjoyed various gourmet sausages.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>DUCK SAUSAGE AND FOIE GRAS<|>Duck sausage and foie gras is a popular dish served at Hot Doug's, highly rated by customers.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>SMOKED CRAYFISH AND PORK SAUSAGE<|>Smoked crayfish and pork sausage is another dish offered at Hot Doug's, noted for its unexpected flavor.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>SMOKED PORTUGUESE LINGUICA<|>Smoked Portuguese Linguica is a spicy sausage dish available at Hot Doug's, praised for its taste.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>GINGER SPIKED RABBIT SAUSAGE<|>Ginger spiked rabbit sausage is a unique offering at Hot Doug's, though it received mixed reviews from the narrator.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICKEN AND SPINACH SAUSAGE<|>Chicken and spinach sausage is a dish at Hot Doug's that the narrator found surprisingly enjoyable.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>Duck fat fries are a popular side dish at Hot Doug's, known for their exceptional flavor and texture.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
