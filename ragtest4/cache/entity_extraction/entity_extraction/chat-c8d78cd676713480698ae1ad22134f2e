Don't be deterred, it is worth the wait and the line moves fast. When I went the line came out the door, turned the corner and went all along the side of the building and then another length of equal distance. I was ordering within 30 minutes. I went here as a vegetarian and was all set to get their veggie dog, but when I saw the wild game menu I broke-veg hardcore. I got one veggie dog to try it out, but then I also got a wild boar sausage and some fries. Everything was delicious! The wild boar was perfectly seasoned, garlicy, peppery, and oh so meaty. The veggie dog was also delicious and made me feel kinda guilty for breaking-veg. If your vegetarian this place will still satisfy your deep down desires for hotdogs. Get it with the works! Fast efficient service + good prices + a delicious and ever-changing menu = The best hotdog place I have ever been too (including Pinks and Oki Dog in Hollywood, and Papaya Dogs in NYC).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
