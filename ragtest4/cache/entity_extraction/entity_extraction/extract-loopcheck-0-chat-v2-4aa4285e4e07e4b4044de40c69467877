Impeccably impressive as always to say the least. If you haven't had the opportunity to get to Alinea yet, try as you must to do so! The culinary tour is undeniably mind blowing, but their newest concept which brings the wonderment of the kitchen at Alinea right to you with the 'Chocolate' dessert finale is truly unbelievable. Plated right on your table by Grant himself, or his insanely talented Exec Chef, Matt, it is an experience of the highest caliber in sensory mind-meld. They have also made a few minor tweaks since my last visit which should be noted. First up, they are no longer offering 2 menu size selections (\"taste\" and \"tour\"), they have gone to an exclusive 20 course full tour only format. They also have upped their game, if that's even possible, and now do bring a special individualized course to the table acknowledging special events and such. Way to improve the unimprovable! I can't say enough good things.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences and culinary tours, offering a unique dessert finale experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAROLINE A.<|>PERSON<|>Caroline A. is a special guest who attended a birthday celebration at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANT<|>PERSON<|>Grant is a chef at Alinea who personally plates the 'Chocolate' dessert finale.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATT<|>PERSON<|>Matt is the Executive Chef at Alinea, known for his talent in the kitchen.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>EVENT<|>A special occasion celebrated during the visit to Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>EVENT<|>The 'Chocolate' dessert finale is a unique culinary experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>20 COURSE FULL TOUR<|>EVENT<|>Alinea's exclusive dining format that consists of a full 20-course meal.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAROLINE A.<|>ALINEA<|>Caroline A. celebrated her birthday at Alinea, making her visit special.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRANT<|>ALINEA<|>Grant is a chef at Alinea who enhances the dining experience by personally plating desserts.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATT<|>ALINEA<|>Matt, as the Executive Chef, plays a crucial role in the culinary offerings at Alinea.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>ALINEA<|>The birthday celebration took place at Alinea, highlighting the restaurant's role in special events.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>ALINEA<|>The 'Chocolate' dessert finale is a signature offering that exemplifies Alinea's innovative dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>20 COURSE FULL TOUR<|>ALINEA<|>The 20-course full tour is the exclusive dining format offered by Alinea, showcasing its culinary excellence.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
