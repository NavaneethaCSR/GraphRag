Especially when I'm on vacation. Especially when I've taken public transit out to some godforsaken part of suburbia and walked what seems like a mile across some questionable sidewalks. But Hot Doug's was worth it. We were in line for about 45 minutes on a Friday just after opening time with a mix of people who knew what to expect and people like us who were unprepared for the magnitude of the thing. But eventually we turned the corner, eventually we saw the menu, eventually we reached the counter of Doug himself, who was just as happy to take our order for a foie gras dog, a chicago hot dog and some duck fat fries as he was to take the order of the two guys ahead of us who ordered something like twenty hot dogs and two sets for fries between the two of them. \"You can't under-order here\", they said, \"You'd have to get back in line.\" As promised, we found a seat easily, and the food came out quickly. They are working as fast as they can back there, and standing around in line to order is preferable to standing around waiting for your food or looking for a table. \"Trust us, this works\", say the signs. The place is like a museum to encased meats - all sorts of interesting things line the walls, serious or not. Oh? The food? I'm supposed to comment on the food, huh? The hot dogs were excellent. Fresh, well prepared, and above all - well flavored. Doug knows what he's doing and will not steer you wrong. I thought the duck fat fries were excellent as well, though my companion, who is not really a fan of fries, didn't see what all the fuss was about. Like I said. Hate lines. Hate wasting time when on vacation. But this was worth it. Best hot dog of our visit to Chicago by far.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a popular eatery known for its gourmet hot dogs and duck fat fries, located in Chicago.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUG<|>PERSON<|>Doug is the owner and operator of Hot Doug's, known for his friendly service and expertise in preparing hot dogs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in Illinois, known for its diverse food scene, including Hot Doug's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VACATION<|>EVENT<|>The experience of taking time off from work or daily routines to enjoy leisure activities, such as dining at Hot Doug's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINE<|>VERB<|>The action of waiting in a queue to place an order at Hot Doug's, which is a significant part of the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOUG<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Doug is the owner of Hot Doug's and directly involved in the customer service experience at the restaurant.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Hot Doug's is a notable restaurant located in Chicago, contributing to the city's culinary reputation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VACATION<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The visit to Hot Doug's is part of the vacation experience, highlighting the importance of food during leisure time.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINE<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The act of standing in line is a common occurrence at Hot Doug's, indicating its popularity and demand.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
