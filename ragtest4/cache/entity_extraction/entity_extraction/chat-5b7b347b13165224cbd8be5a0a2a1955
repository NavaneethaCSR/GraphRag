This place is WAAAAAAY over-hyped. I came early enough where I didn't have to wait long, my meal was paid for by my work, and I STILL didn't enjoy my experience. Maybe the secret to this place is that people wait so long in line that by the time they get their food, they're so hungry that anything will taste amazing ... If you're visiting and want to try a Chicago hot dog, for the love of god, just find any place that uses Vienna Beef (a lot of places will have the Vienna Beef sign on the window), 'cause that's what makes the Chicago hot dog better than any other. Anyways, this is what I tried: Duck fat fries - these weren't crispy enough; I've had better duck fat fries elsewhere; they were still good, though, 'cause c'mon, they're fries ... The Dog (Chicago-style hot dog) - the best thing I had here by far, but the same dog you'll find in most Chicago hot dog joints The Mountain Man: Elk, Venison, Buffalo and Antelope with Cassis Butter and Coolea Cheese - the dog was a little dry and flavorless; who would trust the palate of a mountain man, anyway? Cognac and Hazelnut Pheasant Sausage with Black Truffle Sauce Moutarde, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris - this was only so-so, and proof that truffles can't save everything; as befitting such a hoighty toighty dog, once you get past the fancy description, there's really not that much substance Calvados-Infused Smoked Duck Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey - this was decent; if you don't like spice, avoid this dog ... In fact, save your time and money and just avoid this place altogether ...\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
