I'm pretty sure Hot Doug's will be a staple-stop on all return visits. I'll break down both my visits on this review: #1 - This visit took place back in April of 2011. I was by myself and it was on a weekday for lunch. I got there at about 11:00 and there was a line just outside the door. The wait to order was about 20 minutes. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Sausage with plantains and remoulade. It was quite simply one of the tastiest items of food that have ever entered my mouth. After the first bite all I could think about was how long I could take savoring this sausage. I even looked at the line and considered getting back in line to order another one. The fries were solid but not spectacular. I'm not a fries guy anyway and immediately regretted not just ordering two sausages. I can't explain how well the flavor of the sausage worked with the plantains and remoulade. It was just perfect. #2 - This time the visit took place on Friday, July 27th. This time I also had the family with me (wife, 9-year old son, 12-year old daughter). I ordered the game of the week. It was a Kangaroo Sausage with Yellow Pepper Aioli, and Goat Feta Cheese. It was outstanding. The kangaroo had a very different flavor that I can't really describe but it went very well with the condiments. I also ordered the Norm Crosby, which is a German Thuringer sausage with beef, pork, garlic and other spices. It was very good also. I got mine with spicy mustard and tomatoes. My wife ordered the Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Creole Mustard, Hominy Grits, and Goat cheese. She got hers minus the grits. The Creole Mustard and Goat Cheese were too rich for her so she scraped it off and put mayo on it. Thank god Doug didn't see it or he might have banned us from the restaurant. I almost slapped her for the sheer embarrassment. After she only ate 1/2 of hers I reapplied the creole mustard and goat cheese and finished hers. It was even better than the Kangaroo. Daughter got the Polish and son got the Italian. They were both solid, but to me the way to go is the specials. In closing I can't recommend Hot Doug's enough. But get the specials, not only because of the sausage, but the special condiments add a world of flavor.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a popular eatery in the Windy City known for its gourmet sausages and unique condiments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDY CITY<|>GEO<|>The Windy City is a nickname for Chicago, Illinois, where Hot Doug's is located.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMAICAN JERK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A specific dish offered at Hot Doug's that features a spicy Jamaican jerk flavor profile.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KANGAROO SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A special dish at Hot Doug's that features kangaroo meat, served with unique condiments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORM CROSBY<|>EVENT<|>A German Thuringer sausage offered at Hot Doug's, made with beef, pork, garlic, and spices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKED SHRIMP AND PORK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A dish at Hot Doug's that combines smoked shrimp and pork, served with various condiments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREOLE MUSTARD<|>EVENT<|>A condiment used in various dishes at Hot Doug's, known for its rich flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOAT CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>A type of cheese used in some dishes at Hot Doug's, adding a rich flavor to the meals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>The narrator's family includes a wife and two children, who accompany them on their visit to Hot Doug's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APRIL 2011<|>EVENT<|>The month and year of the narrator's first visit to Hot Doug's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIDAY, JULY 27TH<|>EVENT<|>The date of the narrator's second visit to Hot Doug's with their family.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>WINDY CITY<|>Hot Doug's is located in the Windy City, which is Chicago, Illinois.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>JAMAICAN JERK SAUSAGE<|>The Jamaican Jerk Sausage is a dish served at Hot Doug's, highlighting its menu offerings.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>KANGAROO SAUSAGE<|>The Kangaroo Sausage is a special dish featured at Hot Doug's, showcasing its unique offerings.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>NORM CROSBY<|>The Norm Crosby is another dish available at Hot Doug's, indicating the variety of sausages offered.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>SMOKED SHRIMP AND PORK SAUSAGE<|>The Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage is a dish at Hot Doug's, demonstrating its diverse menu.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CREOLE MUSTARD<|>Creole Mustard is a condiment used in dishes at Hot Doug's, enhancing the flavor of the meals.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>GOAT CHEESE<|>Goat Cheese is a topping used in some dishes at Hot Doug's, contributing to the flavor profile of the meals.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMILY<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The narrator's family visited Hot Doug's together, indicating a shared experience at the restaurant.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APRIL 2011<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The narrator's first visit to Hot Doug's occurred in April 2011, marking a significant date for the experience.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIDAY, JULY 27TH<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The narrator's second visit to Hot Doug's took place on Friday, July 27th, indicating a specific event in time.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
