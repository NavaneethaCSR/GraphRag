Then it took another 1 1/2 hours (came literally 10-15 minutes after it had opened) while waiting on line in the blazing 90 weather in order to get my food. In fact, there was a worker who came out and said, \"We are glad that you guys came all the way here for our food, but the fact is that you will be waiting on this line for around 2 hours. We recommend going to another place to eat. We will always be here. If you do decide to stay on the line, please be sure to stay hydrated. We are very good friends with this man here (points to the man in the ice cream truck). He will take very good care of you. If you do get sick, do not come in to use the restroom. I am lazy and do not want to clean up after you. Again, we are glad that you came and be safe.\" I have no idea how I remember all of that... But try to imagine my excitement when the couple in front of me left. It didn't make much of a difference, but that was 5 min. closer for me to getting my hot dogs and fries. When I finally got to the counter, I ordered the foie gras, Chicago, thuringer, and provolone chicken with duck confit hot dogs along with duck fat fries. All I can say is: please, please, PLEASE open up a shop in New York! The hot dogs in general were so juicy and, not to mention, huge. The foie gras hot dog was so rich and delicious. The Chicago dog was definitely better than Portillo's. The thuringer (garlicky) and provolone chicken (pretty spicy) were okay. But the duck fat fries - oh the duck fat fries! - were amazing (only available Fridays and Saturdays)! It was fatty and crisp. There was a man behind me who came and waited in the long line only for these fries! I was stuffing myself so much so that the couple who I was sharing a table with had asked my boyfriend as to where I had room to put it all in. So question has it: was the wait worth it?
