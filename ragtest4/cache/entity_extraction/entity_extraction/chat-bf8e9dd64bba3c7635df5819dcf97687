Holy crap is that a lot of food even though each course is a bite or two. Here's a piece of advice, don't down a bottle of champagne with your friend before you get here -- I made that mistake and was pretty tipsy -- asking the waiter (who I'm SURE hated me) if every course was an 'amuse bouche'. The food was very unique and delicious. If I were to go back, I'd get the 12 course -- 24 was way too much for me. Also, if you don't like white wine (I personally hate it) -- don't get the wine pairing. Most of it was white wine and therefore I didn't drink most of it. The decor is really cool and while waiting for my friend to use the restroom before we left I got to watch the kitchen staff running around the kitchen like a well oiled machine. Love Alinea -- hope to go back soon. :)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
