I had the dog and the Keira, everything on. I also ordered chili and cheese on the side. The dog was perfect. I loved everything on it. Also, the meat works well with the chili and cheese. The Keira is good just by itself and the bread. A note about the chili and cheese: the chili is a little watery but if you cover it with cheese, it'll hold together and not drip. I really loved how this place is cheap. It's quite far if you're a tourist. Also, be prepared to wait. Overall, I had a good experience. Use the restrooms if you can...
