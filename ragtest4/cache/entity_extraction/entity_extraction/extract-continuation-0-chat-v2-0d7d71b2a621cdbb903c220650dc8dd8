Though unbelievably expensive for one meal, it was worth it. Truly a destination worth visiting and experiencing. If you go, get the 24 course. For two people, we found that with one of us ordering wine / sharing a glass, the amount of wine was just right (though my girlfriend and I are not big drinkers). The highlights were the hot/cold potato, black ruffle explosion, and cauliflower soup. There was only one dud--a butter themed dish that was way too rich/buttery, bordering inedible. Everything else ranged between very good to \"this is the best thing I've ever tasted.\" Service was flawless. Very innovative, outside-the-box cooking; the best part about Alinea is that the extensive detail and culinary technique that goes into the dishes are designed partly to make you think about an experience food in a unique way, but more so to create flavors that are astonishing. I can't say the same of Moto, which was high on concept/creativity and somewhat absorbed with interest in novelty/technique/playing with food (e.g., all of the liquid nitrogen), but did not deliver flavors within the same league as Alinea (not even close). If you were thinking about going to just one molecular gastronomy restaurant between Moto and Alinea, I'd recommend Alinea over Moto in a heartbeat.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative and unique dining experiences, particularly in molecular gastronomy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moto is a restaurant known for its creative and conceptual approach to dining, but it is noted for not delivering flavors as well as Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIRLFRIEND<|>PERSON<|>The girlfriend of the reviewer who shared the dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>A memorable dining experience at Alinea that included a 24-course meal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE<|>LOCATION<|>The wine shared during the meal, which complemented the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The flawless service experienced during the dinner at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULINARY TECHNIQUE<|>EVENT<|>The extensive detail and culinary techniques used in the dishes at Alinea to create unique flavors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIRLFRIEND<|>ALINEA<|>The girlfriend accompanied the reviewer during their dining experience at Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINNER<|>ALINEA<|>The dinner event took place at Alinea, highlighting its innovative dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE<|>ALINEA<|>The service was a significant aspect of the dining experience at Alinea, contributing to its high rating.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULINARY TECHNIQUE<|>ALINEA<|>The culinary techniques at Alinea are designed to enhance the dining experience and create astonishing flavors.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOTO<|>ALINEA<|>The reviewer compares Moto to Alinea, stating that Alinea delivers superior flavors despite Moto's creativity.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
