I can go on and on about the sensory experience will provide you or how amazing the food is but I think it's well covered. I do have a few things to note to add to it's awesomeness: 1. The company I was with (God forbid she ever read this...) was in love with my ex, so I thought it would be a few hours full of awkward turtleness. But no, the food made us bond more than anyone would have expected. Since she was with me during my first experience in the House Grant Built, she'll engrained in my memory as a good friend. 2. I've experienced the tasting menus of Tru, Spiaggia, Moto, Spiaggia, etc. and I must say for the splurge you'd do at any, the quality of this one makes it a steal compared to the others. (respect to said others) 3. I usually collect the menus from fine dining establishments and have the chef sign them. After our meal, Grant came out to meet us. I had my menu and pen ready, but he was so good-looking, I froze and didn't ask him to sign my menu. (blush) I still cannot believe someone so young and handsome made the best meal of my life, kicked cancer's ass, and has a slew of accolades. I'll work up the courage next time!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOUSE GRANT BUILT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>House Grant Built is a fine dining establishment known for its exceptional culinary experiences and tasting menus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANT<|>PERSON<|>Grant is a talented chef at House Grant Built, recognized for his culinary skills and accolades.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2007<|>EVENT<|>The year when the dining experience at House Grant Built took place, marking a memorable occasion for the reviewer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tru is a fine dining restaurant known for its tasting menus and high-quality food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPIAGGIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spiaggia is a fine dining restaurant that offers Italian cuisine and tasting menus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moto is a fine dining restaurant known for its innovative culinary offerings and tasting menus.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWKWARD TURTLENESS<|>EVENT<|>A social situation characterized by discomfort and tension, experienced during the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER<|>EVENT<|>A serious illness that Grant has overcome, highlighting his resilience and success in the culinary field.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRANT<|>HOUSE GRANT BUILT<|>Grant is the chef at House Grant Built, contributing to its reputation for exceptional dining experiences.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSE GRANT BUILT<|>TRU<|>Both are fine dining establishments known for their tasting menus, compared by the reviewer.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSE GRANT BUILT<|>SPIAGGIA<|>Both are fine dining establishments known for their tasting menus, compared by the reviewer.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOUSE GRANT BUILT<|>MOTO<|>Both are fine dining establishments known for their tasting menus, compared by the reviewer.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWKWARD TURTLENESS<|>HOUSE GRANT BUILT<|>The dining experience at House Grant Built helped alleviate the awkwardness of the situation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRANT<|>CANCER<|>Grant's success as a chef is highlighted by his overcoming cancer, showcasing his resilience.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
