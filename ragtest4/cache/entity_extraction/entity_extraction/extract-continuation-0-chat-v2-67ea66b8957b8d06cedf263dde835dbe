Hot Doug's is a ritual and a rite of passage anyone and everyone who lives in this city needs to perform. If you have an unrefined palate like mine and go to fine restaurants and wonder why you can't tell why other people like the food so much more than you, this is the place that will bring resurgence to your confidence of saying you can tell good food apart. I want to die eating a hot doug's dog. Do not be the person who later laments about all the years you could be eating here. This is a request, a plea, a call to action, to all fellow humans, go to their web page and look at their daily specials and forget any other place in this city or the world that thinks they know what they are doing with food. Let Doug show you why he is the Michael Jordan of cooking. (Sorry this will be the one review I will not talk about any of the food there or the wait or the setup.
