I hesitate to write too much in detail because every single aspect of the experience is so carefully thought through, and full of wonder and delight, that to reveal so much as the shape of the entrance would diminish the unmitigated joy in discovering each moment for yourself. Suffice it to say that we (as unrepentant foodies) have dined at the finest restaurants in the United States (we're from the Bay area and New York -- so we really mean that), and as I said to my husband midway through the meal, Alinea kicks the French Laundry's arse (among other establishments). I have never been a huge fan of molecular gastronomy, since I have found that taste often seems sacrificed in favor of novelty or presentation (such as I found to be often the case at WD-50, which I know many people love). But Alinea compromises nothing. The presentation is dazzling, right down to the flatware. The taste is outer-worldy. The combinations are unimaginable and yet exhilarating. The service was impeccable. It is, in short, extraordinary. My only regret is that I'm fairly certain that Grant Achatz himself came out to do our final presentation, and I was so tongue-tied and startled, and he seemed so focused and serious, that to say anything directly felt like tapping Yo Yo Ma on the shoulder mid-concerto and saying \"Are you Yo-Yo Ma?\" so I just made some dumb remark and then stared at the table. Alas.
