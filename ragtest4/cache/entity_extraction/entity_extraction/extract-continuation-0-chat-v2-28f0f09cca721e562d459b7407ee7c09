Nothing will ever come close, at least until I go to Next. ;) Words cannot describe the genius that one must have in order to pull of what Achatz et al are doing in a hidden spot a few blocks away from DePaul University. Upon walking through the Willy Wonka like entrance (was I having a flashback or was the room shrinking? ) what looked to be like an elevator door actually was the entrance to an experience like no other. We were welcomed.. A genuinely warm welcome and were whisked away to our little table. This is the 3 Michelin star restaurant that many can never replicate 100 times a night. The meal details? No way brutha, you'll just have to experience it yourself. I will say, you MUST fast before the tasting. I can stuff myself but this meal is not easy. To end our night, around 1:30 am Achatz came out to our table, ( only ours ) painted our table top with a gorgeous edible work of art. Then, with a slight look of insanity, he lifted a volleyball sized ball of freshly made chocolate and slammed it on the table. It shattered and like a pinata, freshly prepared desert \"candy\" came out, cotton candy ect. It was a delicious work of art that, and ( thanks to the volume of wine ) looked like a drug deal gone bad. An abstract depiction with raspberry syrup splattered like blood, some stuff that looked like cocaine and enough pink and purple that gave it a post New Years South Beach VIP lounge appearance.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEXT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Next is a renowned restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences and is associated with chef Grant Achatz.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACHATZ<|>PERSON<|>Grant Achatz is a celebrated chef known for his creative culinary techniques and is the head chef at Next.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPAUL UNIVERSITY<|>GEO<|>DePaul University is a university located in Chicago, Illinois, near the restaurant Next.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHELIN STAR<|>EVENT<|>The Michelin star is a prestigious award given to restaurants for exceptional quality, with Next holding three stars.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1:30 AM<|>LOCATION<|>The time when chef Achatz presented a unique dessert experience at the restaurant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARM WELCOME<|>EVENT<|>The warm welcome refers to the hospitality experienced by guests upon arrival at the restaurant.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDIBLE WORK OF ART<|>EVENT<|>The edible work of art is a dessert created by Achatz that is visually stunning and interactive.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACHATZ<|>NEXT<|>Grant Achatz is the head chef at Next, known for its innovative dining experiences.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEXT<|>DEPAUL UNIVERSITY<|>Next is located a few blocks away from DePaul University, making it accessible to students and visitors.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACHATZ<|>EDIBLE WORK OF ART<|>Grant Achatz created an edible work of art as a unique dessert experience for guests.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WARM WELCOME<|>NEXT<|>Guests at Next receive a warm welcome, enhancing their dining experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHELIN STAR<|>NEXT<|>Next has been awarded three Michelin stars, indicating its high quality and excellence in dining.<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>1:30 AM<|>EDIBLE WORK OF ART<|>The presentation of the edible work of art occurred around 1:30 AM, marking a memorable moment in the dining experience.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
