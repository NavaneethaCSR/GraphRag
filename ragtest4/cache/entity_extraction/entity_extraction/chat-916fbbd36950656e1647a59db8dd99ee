It's required. I mean, you spend so much money, dang it, you'd BETTER LOVE IT! And even if you didn't love it for real, you'll MAKE yourself love it b/c you don't want to look stupid for blowing your rent money on dinner. That being said, this place is pretty amazing. I don't know if it's b/c I'm SUPPPOSED to love it, but it was a great experience, one that I'll remember for years to come. FOOD: The food was not only interesting and complex but aromatically and visually engaging as well. It really is an event. It takes hours. And I found joy in the way I was challenged by the food. It was actually pretty inspirational in some ways. I liked that even after 15 or 20 courses (can't remember how many there were, it's been a few months), I didn't feel over-stuffed. STAFF/SERVICE The staff wasn't mad that we didn't drink wine. In fact, they had a great alternative they suggested, something they had picked out (for the Alcoholics?), some sparkling juice that didn't interfere with the food. WHY ONLY 4 STARS? My rating is more of an in between 4 and 5. The reason it flirts with 4 is because of inaccessibility for the financially challenged. I mean, I like good food and will pay the price, but this is flirting with ridiculous. It's kind of like how I wouldn't pay $2000 for shoes. Even though I can appreciate its design and aesthetics and fawn over it and say things like, \"Yes, it IS genius, it is the perfect shoe,\" I still can't bring myself to buy it. So even though I might pay $500 for a pair of shoes (which I think is still a lot), in the end, it doesn't make me feel great. This is couture food. And I appreciate couture. And I can champion their existence with the rest of them. But the inaccessibility, though it may be celebrated by many, is not a celebrated quality for me personally. And I don't mean to say conversely that cheap production for the masses is a quality I necessarily prize, either (though I can appreciate its contributions as well). But like I say in my profile, no one should really read my reviews anyway. So don't get mad.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
