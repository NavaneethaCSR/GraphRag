As we walked up, there were about 8 guys already in line ~20 minutes before opening. Our wait went by fairly quickly, and we were soon inside...to wait yet again, but this time to order. There's quite a few choices on the menu! What I got: The Cheesy Atomic: Spicy jack cheese, stuffed pork sausage with spicy passion fruit mayo and habanero jack cheese. My favorite - great flavor, and the right amount of heat from the various peppers thrown in the cheese and mayo. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage: with truffle aioli, foie gras mousse, and fleur de sel (fancy salt). I found the foie gras on the duck sausage to be there more for texture than flavor, and the sausage itself was fairly bland. That's to be expected for duck I suppose, given my past experience with duck sausage. I think this would greatly benefit if Doug were to saute the foie gras a bit to warm it up. Norm Crosby: a hot dog with beef, pork, and garlic, served Chicago style. Didn't really notice much of a difference between this and a normal hot dog given all of the condiments thrown on top. Duck Fat Fries: only served on Fridays & Saturdays. Delicious. Spectacular! Some of the best fries I've had. Overall, I'm happy with the food I got at Hot Doug's, and I know my friend is in love with the place and keeps going back any chance he gets. I don't think it was utterly amazing...but it's a fast food place. That said, Hot Doug's is one of the top choices in the city for your favorite fast food/junk food, which is why I give it 5 stars for a fast food joint. I think it's worth a wait - but not the 2+hrs some people have been waiting. If you want to go, get there early on a weekday and (preferably Friday to get your hands on some duck fat fries) and chow down!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a fast food restaurant known for its gourmet hot dogs and unique menu items, located in Chicago.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORM CROSBY<|>PERSON<|>Norm Crosby is a type of hot dog served at Hot Doug's, featuring beef, pork, and garlic, prepared Chicago style.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Duck Fat Fries are a special menu item at Hot Doug's, available only on Fridays and Saturdays, praised for their delicious flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is the city where Hot Doug's is located, known for its vibrant food scene.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIDAY<|>LOCATION<|>Friday is a day when Duck Fat Fries are served at Hot Doug's, making it a popular choice for visitors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SATURDAY<|>LOCATION<|>Saturday is another day when Duck Fat Fries are served at Hot Doug's, attracting customers looking for this special item.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEESY ATOMIC<|>EVENT<|>The Cheesy Atomic is a menu item at Hot Doug's, featuring spicy jack cheese and stuffed pork sausage with unique sauces.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIE GRAS AND SAUTERNES DUCK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage is a gourmet hot dog option at Hot Doug's, known for its rich ingredients.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO<|>Hot Doug's is a fast food restaurant located in Chicago, contributing to the city's culinary reputation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Duck Fat Fries are a special menu item offered at Hot Doug's, available only on specific days.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORM CROSBY<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Norm Crosby is a specific hot dog served at Hot Doug's, showcasing the restaurant's unique offerings.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEESY ATOMIC<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The Cheesy Atomic is a signature dish at Hot Doug's, highlighting the restaurant's creative menu.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOIE GRAS AND SAUTERNES DUCK SAUSAGE<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage is a gourmet item featured on Hot Doug's menu, representing its upscale fast food concept.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>FRIDAY<|>Duck Fat Fries are specifically served on Fridays at Hot Doug's, making it a sought-after item for weekend visitors.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>SATURDAY<|>Duck Fat Fries are also available on Saturdays at Hot Doug's, attracting customers looking for this delicacy.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
