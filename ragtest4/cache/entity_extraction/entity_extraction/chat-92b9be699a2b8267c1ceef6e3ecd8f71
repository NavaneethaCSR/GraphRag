I tried deep dish pizza and an italian beef sandwich both for the first time, but Hot Doug's was my favorite. I was going to order some fries and a Chicago-style dog for sure, but couldn't decide on what 'Special Dog' to get. I landed on the duck sausage w/ foie gras, but when I asked Doug for a recommendation, he said the portuguese smoked sausage with aged cheese was good, so I went with that. He said he wasn't good at recommendations, which I can understand because everything looked great! He was spot on with the rec though because I loved that hot dog. It had such a unique flavor between the smokiness, cheese, and creme topping that melded the 2 together. Chicago dog was good as well as the hand cut fries. Sadly it was Thursday, so I couldn't try the duck fat fries. I saw a sign that said they would be closed for the next 4 days, so I feel lucky to have stopped in when I did. I will most definately stop by Hot Doug's again if/when I come back to CHI town.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
