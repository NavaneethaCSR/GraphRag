Alinea tops French Laundry, Piccaso, Gary Denko on my list of top restaurants in terms of originality, taste and creativity. Hot potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter - this is rather interesting dish. you pull a needle and let the truffle drop and drink it all at once. It's a bit salty Yuba - shrimp,miso, togarashi - this is like an appetizer with the shrimp entwining the pretzel stick. This is artistically beautiful Cauliflower - fiver coatings, three gels, cider - this is a big plate well presented. Very rich and filling with cheese Pear - olive oil, black pepper, eucalyptus - a bowl that when opened the smell of fried eucalyptus expose Wild striped bass - saffron, shellfish, parsnip - this is one of my favorite. Fish is perfectly cooked Yolk - soy, wasabi, yuzu - not good. not tasty just a yolk inside some gel Chicken - sesame, morel, indian flavors - this is another bigger plate. good flavor and pretty display Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme - just a piece of bacon which you have to tear down from a dangling steel holder Sweet potato - bourbon, brown sugar, smoldering cinnomons - this looks like a fried ball on an incense stick Mustard - passionfruit, allspice, soy - i think this was just a dab of ice sorbet Foie Gras - turnip, shiso, sudachi - yummy. Only 2 little cubes but taste great Lobster - popcorn, butter, curry - this is really good and fresh lobster Pork Belly - iceberg, cucumber, thai distillation - another rich dish Black truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan - haha this is one of those that tastes very salty due to the truffle. You bite into a little wonton and the truffle juice is filling up your mouth Wagyu beef - powdered A-1, potato, chips - love love love the beef. freshest taste. This is paired with a dry ice aroma which started out as the centerpiece Grape soda - one bite - really this is just a gap filler piece of candy Yogurt - pomegranate, cassia - some tiny dessert . nothing too special Bubble gum - long pepper, hibiscus, creme fraiche - this is rather cute you are suppose to suck the candies out of the cube Transparency - of raspberry, yogurt - just a piece of candy. very light Rhubarb - goat milk, onion, lavender air - this dish is sit ontop of an object like a pillow which is filled with lavendar air. Chocolate - prune, olive, pine - i dont remember too much about this Dry caramel - salt - again just one small bite but we were very full by then Overall I am very impressed. Definitely the best upscale restaurant in the North America in terms of artistic presentation and taste.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
