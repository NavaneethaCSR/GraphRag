Instead, I'm going to make some minor complaints. Given the price, the staff to diner ration, etc. etc. these things could be improved. First, salt. There were two dishes (surf clam and and lamb) that had components that were burn-the-tongue salty. Seriously - burger king chicken sandwich levels of salt. In the case of the clam, when all the elements were mixed in one bite, it worked out okay. A number of other dishes were also at the too-high end of the salt spectrum, though not to that drastic of an extent. Which brings me to flavor. The problem with having too much salt is that it interferes with tasting anything besides the salt. In general, I think the focus here is on avant garde technique and beautiful presentation and flavor is neglected. There were a number of dishes - even those without salt problems - that tasted good, but not exceptionally good or interesting or unexpected. The earl grey cookies didn't really taste of anything at all, although that course worked as a whole. Wine pairing was hit and miss - for the first half of the tour, things didn't match so well for me, and some of the wines didn't work for me at all, but the second half was spot on (although it's possible that nothing pairs well with menthol) Finally, I wish that there was a restaurant in this class that was as creative with the front of house as it is with the food. There are so many other possible ways to experience a meal - it shouldn't always have to be a dim, hushed, dining room with erudite and slightly stuffy waiters. We had a great time, but high prices and hype breed high expectations and I expected more!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
