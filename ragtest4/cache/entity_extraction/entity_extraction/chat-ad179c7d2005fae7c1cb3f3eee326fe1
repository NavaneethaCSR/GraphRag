We had a bit of a wait which was fine b/c there was enough room to hang outside and review the menu while enjoying a glass of wine or a cold beer if desired. After waiting our expected wait time, I inquired how much longer we had as we had a prior engagement we needed to get to and we were told they would be seating several parties so we continued to wait. After about 15 people were seated, I inquired again and the hostess rudely advised that she looked for us & couldn't find us which was BS b/c we were standing where we should have been. They keep track of people by their clothing and a brief description. We were eventually seated and enjoyed a great lunch and a bottle of wine. The chorizo stuffed olives were my favorite and something I will crave for a long time. We shared several items and had both of the paninis they feature on the menu which were both unique and tasty. Besides the snotty hostess, I really enjoyed this place!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
