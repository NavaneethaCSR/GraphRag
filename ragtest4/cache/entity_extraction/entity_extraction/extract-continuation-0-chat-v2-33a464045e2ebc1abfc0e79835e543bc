From wrapping your own spring rolls with rice paper with flowers between two sheets (pork belly), to the 3 layer plate that has 3 separate dishes stacked one on top of each other (lobster course), the earl grey pillow wafting out grey essence while we ate earl grey cookies and lemon custard dessert (earl grey), to the art on the table (chocolate course - which I was told took 2 years to create) everything was beautiful and most things tasted amazing. My favorite courses taste wise were the yuba, pork belly, thai banana, goose and bubble gum. My favorite courses look wise were the yuba, pork belly, lobster, hot potato, bacon (swine on a twine), venison, okay pretty much all of the dishes. It really is eating art. That is why I took a picture of almost every course and have looked at it about 10 times now. I just had dinner there on Sat (Mar. 6). I have to also say the service was amazing as well, which just added to the great dining experience.
