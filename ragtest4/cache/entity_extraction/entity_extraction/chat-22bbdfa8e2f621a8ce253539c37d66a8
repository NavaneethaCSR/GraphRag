We managed to get in while visiting Chicago last November on a waitlist for a Wednesday night. Fortunately for us, someone canceled their 9:30PM reservations and we snapped them up without a second thought. To start, entering Alinea is like entering someplace out of a Tim Burton movie. It is very Wonka-esque and a hint at the irreverence of what lies ahead. Alinea is in fact, theater as much as food - interactive, innovative and entirely fun. They offer one menu only, a tasting menu with the selection of 2 different wine parings, a standard pairing and a reserve. My advice to you, go all the way. You will not regret it. I will not go through each course as enough have already done that, but like others have said, all of the courses are outstanding, while several are unforgettable and they are all incredibly innovative and your participation is required. We left Alinea feeling completely satisfied and completely delighted. The meal and the experience was completely worth the price of admission. If I had to pick which was the \"better\" meal, Alinea's or The French Laundry, I would, and am, declining to choose. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum, both executed flawlessly. They are my 2 favorite meals of all time. If I had any disspointment with Alinea at all, it is that Chef Achatz, who was in the kitchen on the evening we dined, left for the night before I thought to ask to get a picture with him. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to go back...\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
