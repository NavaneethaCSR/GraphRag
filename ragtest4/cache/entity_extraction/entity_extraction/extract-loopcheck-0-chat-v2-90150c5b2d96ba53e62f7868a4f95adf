The dishes that stand out to me are the English Pea, the hot potato cold potato, the truffle explosion and the Short rib beggar's purse. All 19 courses were very good, some were mind blowing. We did not do the wine pairing, we had one bottle of pinot noir and our bill was about $730 for 2 people. Definitely the most money I have ever spent on a meal, but worth it. Go if you get the chance. The only bad thing--my husband and I feel spoiled now.
