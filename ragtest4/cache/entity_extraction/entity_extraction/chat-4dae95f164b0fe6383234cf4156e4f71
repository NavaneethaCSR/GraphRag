Finally, tonight was my chance, and I was blown away. Upon arrival, I was a bit in shock. The outside was ultra-modern, almost resembling a lounge. It was everything that Thomas Keller is not: modern and chic. Fresh baked breads? Nope. Butter and 3 types of Salt?! Nada! Chocolates to take home? No way! I applaud Achatz. He highly deserves his ratings. To leave culinary mecca and create a completely original and imaginative restaurant and food concept is rare these days and something that is hard to find. From start to finish, everything is not just delicious, but also beautifully presented as if it were a work of art and at times, requires a diner's personal interaction with the foods..it's all quite amazing, and truly, an unforgettable experience. So....12 courses at Alinea for $150 or 9 courses at French Laundry for $240? You pick...but I still enjoyed them both for their distinguishable styles and opposite philosophies that still resulted in some of the best dishes my taste-buds have ever had. PS: The staff has a sense of humor and tends to be very engaging. How refreshing :o)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
