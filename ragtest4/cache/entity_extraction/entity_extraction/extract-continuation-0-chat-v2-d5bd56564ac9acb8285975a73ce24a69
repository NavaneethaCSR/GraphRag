Doug himself is right there behind the counter taking your order, which is pretty cool. He's a nice guy! My most recent visit was last week and I tried: -The Mountain Man - I don't remember exactly what was on this but it was good! I had it last year as well. I like the mix of game meats in this sausage -Spicy Alligator- my favorite! This had cajun shrimp remoulade and goat cheese. This is also on this week's menu so if you go, get this! I can't remember what else I had in the past but I remember it being DELICIOUS. I love the unique combinations of sauces and cheese. Doug really knows how to pair them well with the meat. I also like the exotic meat they use. Where else can you have alligator or rattlesnake sausage?
