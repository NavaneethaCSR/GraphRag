There were 5 of us and one of the people in our party had made the reservations about 2 months in advance. We were visiting Chicago and had already planned a weekend of food - Taste of Chicago, that famous pancake place (I can not remember the name - The Pancake House maybe?? haha), and of course Alinea. We got pretty dressed for the occasion. Men please remember jackets only. The ladies wore dresses and it seemed to suit the night. I was happy they sat us at a nice big round table. The restaurant is very minimalistic which I liked and so clean and in order it really was a pleasure just to be there. The service was quite quite good....interestingly enough I was NOT impressed most by the TASTE of the food. I was impressed by the whole creative dining experience thing AND the fact that they were able to tailor our 12 course \"tasting\" to some specific dietary requirements that I have. This means: no dairy, no eggs, no meat (except white meat chicken), nothing fried or heavily cooked in oil, no butter (minimal if any), no coconut. For each course I had something a bit different...something tweaked to suit my needs....if they had milk I had soy milk, if they had fried, I had dehydrated. One of the coolest parts was the beef centerpiece (I had himachi instead). I really do not want to spoil it for anyone who plans on dining here but you will know what I am talking about when you get your centerpieces..... In terms of taste I was wowed but at the same time I was not....weird right? Two of the dishes had coriander in them and it really overpowered what was underneath it. One fish dish in particular I did not care for the fish at all....i found it WAYYYY too fishy BUT in Alinea's defense I know that the fish was not bad it was simply a fishy type of fish....my Asian friends who we dined with loved the fish so I knew it was A OK just not my thing (I wish I could remember what kind of fish it was!) The desserts are so different and a lot of fun to eat. This is definitely the type of place you must be prepared to be spending anywhere from $200 - $400 a head (maybe more!) All in all a great dining experience indeed!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
