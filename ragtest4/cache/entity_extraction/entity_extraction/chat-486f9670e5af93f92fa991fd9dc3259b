This was some time ago, but I still get a little teary-eyed when I reminisce about the deliciousness. This is a dining experience. If you are not going to appreciate the fact that this is intended to be a sensory exploration of gourmet food, science, architecture, and wine expertise then you might be better off at a local bistro where you can predict each outcome. Every taste on the menu is designed to be presented in a unique way, to bring out flavors or pairings of flavors in ways you'd never have imagined. As I recall, they actually partner with a ceramics artist and others who create plates/dishes or other devices (yep, devices) to suit the particular dish you are being served. I want to say each little bite is a work of art, is that too over the top? Each item was a sensory experience whether due to scent (using hot bricks to bring out the full scent of fresh rosemary sprigs with a particular dish, for example - -amazing and heady), for your eyes (a sculpture or sorts, with the tastes resting at the top), for your mouth (the consistencies of each food are so varied and unpredictable). Each item we ate that night was delicious and (ahem) might I say arousing?! I mean, literally, my senses were so completely aroused, it was so decadent. We ate from approx. 8pm to maybe 2am, fairly nonstop. At the end, I was full in a good way, but also loaded (the wine pairings - - perfect) and so content. The staff were all cordial and our servers had great personality. As I recall, the four of us spent about $1200, so think of it as a little food vacation that you should experience, because you deserve to be a celebutante at least once in your life. I keep meaning to go back. I'll stop now, I'm whipping myself into a food frenzy. . . .\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
