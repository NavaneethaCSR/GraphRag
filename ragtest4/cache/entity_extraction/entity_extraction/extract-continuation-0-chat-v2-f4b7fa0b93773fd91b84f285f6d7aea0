Dining won't ever be executed at a level as high as this for the near future. Prepare to watch your pallet grow throughout the meal. I can literally re-imagine every dish in my head, it's basically ingrained in my head. That being said, everything here is fun. They're formal, but not pretentious. I've been to some pretty stuffy places in New York that act like it's a privilege to dine there, if anything, it's a privilege to dine here, and they're very professional about it. The food is great, the presentation just as great. The involvement of the diner is a key aspect of the experience. I dined here back in July when they still had the 26-course tour running and I know the menu's changed since then, but a few of my favorite courses were the pork belly spring roll, the truffle dishes, lobster, king crab, tournedos, lamb, chocolate, and squab. There are a few pointers I'd like to give to fellow yelpers, though. Don't look at the menu at all. I know that you're paying a huge sum to dine here, but going in with the an open mind, not knowing anything, and letting Achatz dictate everything is the best way to experience it in my opinion. And finally, leave the cameras and notepad at home. There are plenty of people taking pictures, just steal there's and enjoy your meal. There isn't a thing that hasn't been said by a yelper or blogger already, so give that a break. Besides I'm sure the entire Alinea team will like it that way better, anyway. *****\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant in Chicago known for its innovative and high-level dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACHATZ<|>PERSON<|>Grant Achatz is the chef and co-owner of Alinea, known for his creative culinary techniques and leadership in the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULY<|>EVENT<|>A month when the reviewer dined at Alinea and experienced the 26-course tour.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK BELLY SPRING ROLL<|>EVENT<|>A specific dish enjoyed by the reviewer during their dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUFFLE DISHES<|>EVENT<|>A type of dish that was highlighted as a favorite by the reviewer at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOBSTER<|>EVENT<|>A seafood dish that was part of the reviewer's favorite courses at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING CRAB<|>EVENT<|>A seafood dish that was part of the reviewer's favorite courses at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOURNEDOS<|>EVENT<|>A meat dish that was part of the reviewer's favorite courses at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMB<|>EVENT<|>A meat dish that was part of the reviewer's favorite courses at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>EVENT<|>A dessert item that was part of the reviewer's favorite courses at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUAB<|>EVENT<|>A dish that was part of the reviewer's favorite courses at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACHATZ<|>ALINEA<|>Grant Achatz is the chef and co-owner of Alinea, influencing the dining experience there.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULY<|>ALINEA<|>The reviewer dined at Alinea in July, experiencing the restaurant's offerings during that time.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORK BELLY SPRING ROLL<|>ALINEA<|>The pork belly spring roll is a dish served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUFFLE DISHES<|>ALINEA<|>Truffle dishes are served at Alinea and were highlighted as favorites by the reviewer.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOBSTER<|>ALINEA<|>Lobster is a dish served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING CRAB<|>ALINEA<|>King crab is a dish served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOURNEDOS<|>ALINEA<|>Tournedos is a dish served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAMB<|>ALINEA<|>Lamb is a dish served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>ALINEA<|>Chocolate is a dessert served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SQUAB<|>ALINEA<|>Squab is a dish served at Alinea that the reviewer enjoyed.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
