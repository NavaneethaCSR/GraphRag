After getting up at 9am and riding over here, only three people were in front of us when the door opened at 10:30. The service here is EXTREMELY fast, mind you, so once you actually put your order in, you're usually out within 5-10 minutes. I ordered a corn dog and the duck sausage with foie gras, which I have been waiting over a year to try. Completely worth it. I can't even describe how tasty it was -- and as well, as a huge fan of corn dogs, this corn dog was one of the best made ones I've ever eaten. My boyfriend also ordered one of the brats (I think?) with jack daniels and gouda -- which was delicious and made me want to try making it at home. Overall, this place completely lives up to the hype and anyone who says otherwise is a hipster. So says I.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
