Last week, however, I was on the bus reading the RED EYE and there it was, 90 Miles! I gathered a few friends to introduce them to my native cuisine. The moment we walked in we were greeted by the owner Alberto, pouring Cuban Cafe to any body that reached for it. I must say, the experience that followed was amazing. The lechon was season to perfection and trust me I know; it is my favorite dish! I felt like I was back in Miami but only cooler. As for my friend, I suggested for them to have the Cubano, Ropa Vieja, and the steak sandwich, we also ordered empanadas and tamales cubanos. This place is what Cuban food and hospitality is all about!!!
