This place is AMAZING! This is not just food - it is an experience so you have to go with an open mind. Every course is an adventure on its own that had me asking the same question over time - What the heck is it, how do I eat this, and why is this soooo good?! No worries though, the waiter explains before you can even ask. My palate matured leaps and bounds from this meal alone! The service was impeccable! It was perfectly orchestrated from beginning to end. My glass was never empty. There was never a single crumb on my table. If you have go to the bathroom 10 times, you will use 11 napkins for they replace it every time you leave the table. During our dining, my boyfriend dropped a little chocolate onto his shirt. Not 30 seconds later, a small plate with a napkin on it was placed onto our table. He picked up the napkin and a shout wipe fell out. At the end of the evening, upon receiving our copies of the menu to commemorate our experience, I noticed that mine was wishing me a Happy Birthday...nice touch! So was the extra treat they slid in for me. To top it off, this is the first time, I've ever been escorted to the door at the end of dining!
