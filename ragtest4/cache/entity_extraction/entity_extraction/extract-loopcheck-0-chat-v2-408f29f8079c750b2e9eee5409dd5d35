By far, the best meal and dining experience I've ever had. (having been to les nomades, everest room, charlie trotters, tru, the former Trio in evanston...i think i can say that.) My taste buds were so exhausted from all the amazing new textures, temperatures, surprises and flavors throughout our 3 hour dinner. Everything, even things that I wouldn't normally like, like crab mouse, was delicious. I have to say the menthol chocolate dessert at the end was my least favorite dish...mainly I feel it was more a gimmic and theatrical display, than a great dessert, but everything else was total genius. Oh wait, actually, the course Thai Distilliation, was totally not a course people...at least it shouldn't have been counted as a course...it was a beverage, picture half a glass of champagne...but oh well, perhasp that was over my head. I highly recommend going to Alinea at least once in your lifetime.
