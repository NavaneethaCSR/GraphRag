I just visited Hot Doug's for the first time this past Monday with my son, who is home for the holidays from the Air Force Academy. What a great experience. We did have to wait for about 45 minutes in line, outside and down the street, but I think it was all part of the experience. I had the foie gras hot dog with the black truffle mayo, something like that, it was great. I also had a crayfish and pork sausage, which was just okay. My son had the daily wild game sausage, which was wonderful; he also had another daily special with cheese stuffed peppers chipolte and pecans etc., it was great! We did have an order of fries that we split, they were good, but want to come back for the duck fat fries! Another day...\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
