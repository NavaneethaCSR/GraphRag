I was, but shouldn't have been, surprised that in 2006 Gourmet magazine rated it the number ONE restaurant in America (http://www.epicurious.co). Some of the dishes are created from the much-lauded \"sous vide\" cooking which explains some of the unique textures presented in the dishes. The kitchen hums with an unexpectedly quiet and efficient energy. I was unfortunate enough to have only the 12 course, and wish I had room (and money) for the marathon 24. Remember, though, a \"course\" can be as small as a bite-sized morsel (for one example, think Gobstopper on crack). Service was excellent. Case in point: my wife left her butter knife askew on the edge her bread plate and a waiter -- thinking the knife might clatter onto the table -- swooped in to adjust the knife to keep it on the plate! Make reservations and come prepared for an exquisite experience. Upsides: - The best in high-end cuisine. Period. Downsides: - Expensive, but you get what you pay for. - Might be intimidating for the non-foodie.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GOURMET MAGAZINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gourmet magazine is a publication that rated the restaurant as the number one in America in 2006.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUS VIDE<|>EVENT<|>Sous vide is a cooking technique used to create unique textures in dishes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>LOCATION<|>The restaurant is known for its innovative flavors and high-end cuisine, rated number one by Gourmet magazine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAITER<|>PERSON<|>The waiter provided excellent service by adjusting a butter knife to prevent it from falling.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIFE<|>PERSON<|>The wife of the narrator who experienced the restaurant's service.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOURMET MAGAZINE<|>RESTAURANT<|>Gourmet magazine rated the restaurant as the number one in America in 2006.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAITER<|>RESTAURANT<|>The waiter is an employee of the restaurant providing service to customers.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIFE<|>WAITER<|>The wife interacted with the waiter during the dining experience.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUS VIDE<|>RESTAURANT<|>The restaurant uses sous vide cooking techniques to enhance the dining experience.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
