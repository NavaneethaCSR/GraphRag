I really want to give my first one to Alinea although I went there awhile back. It's the best meal I've ever had. Taste, atmosphere, decoration, service are excellent. Creativity is amazing. Every course is like an art piece. Me and my fiancee were debating to do 12 or 27 courses when we booked and finally we chose 27 courses tour menu. It's a long tour, enough time to fly coast to coast, but it's an incredible experience. We're exciting to wait for the next course. They use different tools and effects to enhance the dinning experience. I highly recommend the 27 courses meal. I felt bad for the people sat next to us who only had 12 courses and didn't know what my other 15 courses taste like. Yes, it's pricey but it's worth every pennies.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YELP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yelp is a platform where users can write reviews about businesses, including restaurants like Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative and artistic dining experiences, offering a multi-course menu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIANCEE<|>PERSON<|>The speaker's partner who participated in the decision-making process regarding the number of courses to order at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>27 COURSES<|>EVENT<|>A special dining experience at Alinea where guests can enjoy a 27-course meal, showcasing creativity and culinary art.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 COURSES<|>EVENT<|>A shorter dining experience at Alinea, consisting of 12 courses, which some guests opted for instead of the longer menu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>EVENT<|>The overall experience of dining at Alinea, characterized by exceptional taste, atmosphere, and service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COAST TO COAST<|>LOCATION<|>Refers to the extensive travel involved in reaching Alinea, indicating its significance as a dining destination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRICEY<|>VERB<|>Describes the cost of the dining experience at Alinea, indicating it is expensive but worth the investment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIANCEE<|>ALINEA<|>The speaker and their fiancée made a joint decision to experience the 27-course meal at Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>YELP<|>Alinea is a restaurant that can be reviewed on Yelp, where the speaker intends to share their experience.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>27 COURSES<|>ALINEA<|>The 27-course meal is a specific event offered at Alinea, highlighting its unique dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>12 COURSES<|>ALINEA<|>The 12-course meal is another option available at Alinea, contrasting with the 27-course experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>ALINEA<|>The dining experience at Alinea is characterized by its creativity and excellence in service and atmosphere.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COAST TO COAST<|>ALINEA<|>The reference to traveling coast to coast emphasizes the significance of dining at Alinea as a destination.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRICEY<|>ALINEA<|>The dining experience at Alinea is described as pricey, indicating the high cost associated with it.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
