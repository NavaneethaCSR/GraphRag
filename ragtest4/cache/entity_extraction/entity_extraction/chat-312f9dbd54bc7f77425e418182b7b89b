My parents took me here as part of my college graduation present and I was stoked about it. So yes, I may be a little bias as I'm probably way too young to really understand what it is to go fine dining. But I digress. While I was walking to our table when we first got seated, I wanted to let my parents sit on the booth side so they'd be more comfortable, but as I was pulling my chair out one of the guys grabbed the chair from me and sternly goes, \"NO, miss. You aren't sitting here. You're sitting in the booth.\" Wow. Thanks douche. I was just trying to be a considerate daughter by letting the parentals have the more comfortable seats. Didn't realize you loved your budding career as a seating guy so much... Anyway, after that it was all uphill as the courses and wine pairings we got were amazing. Let me tell you, It's very Willy Wonka in that kitchen haha. One of our desserts was served to us in a tube on a hot towel called a \"bubblegum shot\" and there was tapioca and pink stuff in it. Like I said, I'm no fine dining pro. I call it like it is. A tube with pink stuff in it. And it was delicious. The food and presentation really was amazing, but that credit goes to Willy Wonka Chef Grant, not the douchey seating guy. Man was he a douche. Whatever, he's just a seating guy. I got eye-raped while walking to the bathroom too by one of their tiny little dishwasher guys. It was quite creepy. Guess they all find their way into the fine dining world one way or another. My fault for wearing heels and a leopard print skirt to dinner, I guess? At the end of the night the douchebaggery and eye-raping was worth it because my parents love fine dining and could not stop raving about each course. They fell in love with this place. As long as they're happy I'm happy. Can't have it all!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
