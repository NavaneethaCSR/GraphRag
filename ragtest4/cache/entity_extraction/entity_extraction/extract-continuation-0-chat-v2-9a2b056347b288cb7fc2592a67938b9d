The food is different but the experience is just as superb. Of course the focus here is on molecular gastronomy. There is only one option when dining at Alinea- you'll have the 21-course (give or take a few) prix fixe menu, which will run you roughly $300. If you want the wine pairing, add in another $150. Trust me, it'll be worth it. You'll leave drunker than a sorority girl, but a happy one. There is no menu, and everyone at your table will have the exact same thing. If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, be sure to let them know up front. You'll start with some frozen cocktail creations, with just a touch of alcohol in each. Other than this, there is no liquor so don't ask for a martini. Then you'll move on to a few cold dishes and progress into the bigger, meatier dishes (including rabbit and a piece of venison, which was soooo good). Try to keep count if you can, so you can pace yourself accordingly. If you eat everything on your plate, you might be too full to enjoy the last several courses. The dessert presentation is absolutely spectacular and unrivaled by anywhere else I've been. All in all, expect to be there at least 3 hours, closer to 4. Bring good company, hungry bellies, a thirst for creative dishes that you'll never see anywhere else, and hopefully- your company's credit card or a sugar daddy.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The French Laundry is a renowned restaurant known for its exceptional dining experience and focus on molecular gastronomy in the Midwest.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant famous for its innovative 21-course prix fixe menu and unique dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY<|>EVENT<|>Molecular gastronomy is a culinary style that uses scientific techniques to create innovative dishes, emphasizing the transformation of ingredients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINING<|>EVENT<|>The act of eating at Alinea involves a unique experience where all diners receive the same 21-course meal without a traditional menu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCKTAIL CREATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Frozen cocktail creations served at the beginning of the meal, featuring a touch of alcohol.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESSERT PRESENTATION<|>EVENT<|>The dessert presentation at Alinea is noted for being spectacular and unrivaled compared to other dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBIT<|>LOCATION<|>Rabbit is one of the meat dishes served during the dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENISON<|>LOCATION<|>Venison is another meat dish included in the dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIETARY RESTRICTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Dietary restrictions refer to the specific food limitations that diners must communicate to the restaurant prior to the meal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUNGRY BELLIES<|>PERSON<|>Hungry bellies refer to the diners who come to Alinea ready to enjoy the creative dishes offered.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT CARD<|>PERSON<|>A credit card is suggested for diners to cover the cost of the expensive meal at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>ALINEA<|>Both The French Laundry and Alinea are renowned restaurants known for their exceptional dining experiences and innovative culinary techniques.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY<|>Alinea focuses on molecular gastronomy, which is a key aspect of its innovative dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>DINING<|>Dining at Alinea involves a unique experience with a 21-course meal that is served without a menu.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>COCKTAIL CREATIONS<|>Cocktail creations are served at the beginning of the dining experience at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>DESSERT PRESENTATION<|>The dessert presentation is a significant part of the dining experience at Alinea, noted for its spectacular nature.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>RABBIT<|>Rabbit is one of the meat dishes served during the dining experience at Alinea.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>VENISON<|>Venison is another meat dish served during the dining experience at Alinea.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>DIETARY RESTRICTIONS<|>Diners must communicate any dietary restrictions before the dining experience at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>HUNGRY BELLIES<|>Hungry bellies refer to the diners who come to Alinea ready to enjoy the creative dishes offered during the dining experience.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING<|>CREDIT CARD<|>A credit card is suggested for diners to cover the cost of the expensive meal at Alinea.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
