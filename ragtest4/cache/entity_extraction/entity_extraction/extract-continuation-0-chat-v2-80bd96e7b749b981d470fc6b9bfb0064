What can I say other than FOODGASM!!! At first, we felt out of place...we were a younger couple surrounded by a mixed crowd of 40-somes on a double date, a table of young executives buying out the bar, a family of 4 where the parents came saying how they loved it here last time, etc etc. But we felt right at ease when the food arrived and they told us exactly how they wanted to eat it. Hey, we can follow directions :) Every dish was the best dish of my life because of the various tastes, presentations and overall quality. I loved the ideas and creativity behind each dish. Except I hated the beet dish - I can never be friends with a beet and this dish, albeit a wonderfully tender short rib was cooked to perfection underneath it all, was screaming beet flavors. Ewww. I know that I have nothing to compare this to but I'd definitely recommend Alinea to everyone. My \"mass quanitity food only, please\" and \"who cares about presentation and food art\" fiance would, too, and that certainly is an accomplishment for Alinea!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences and creative presentations of food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIANCE<|>PERSON<|>The speaker's fiancé, who typically prefers mass quantity food over presentation and food art, but was impressed by Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOODGASM<|>EVENT<|>A euphoric experience related to the enjoyment of food, particularly in the context of dining at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEET DISH<|>EVENT<|>A specific dish served at Alinea that the speaker disliked due to its strong beet flavors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIANCE<|>ALINEA<|>The fiancé, despite a preference for simple food, was impressed by the dining experience at Alinea, indicating a positive relationship with the restaurant.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOODGASM<|>ALINEA<|>The experience of \"foodgasm\" was achieved during the meal at Alinea, highlighting the restaurant's impact on the speaker's dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEET DISH<|>ALINEA<|>The beet dish is a specific item served at Alinea that elicited a strong negative reaction from the speaker.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
