I enjoyed every one of our 23 courses, the presentation of each is a highlight as is the taste. Meet Grant Achatz \"plating\" our desert at the table was a nice surprise, but after 22 courses, this one is too overpowering. Great concept, probably most memorable dish from a visual impression, but just too much at the end. With having said all that, a definite must for anyone who likes avantgarde cooking and couldn't make it to El Bulli while it was still open ;-) Anthony Bourdain's review of Alinea in his book Medium Raw is great, a bit tough, but closes out fairly.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its avant-garde cooking and innovative dining experiences, offering a multi-course meal that engages all the senses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANT ACHATZ<|>PERSON<|>Grant Achatz is the chef and co-owner of Alinea, known for his creative plating and culinary techniques.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTHONY BOURDAIN<|>PERSON<|>Anthony Bourdain was a renowned chef, author, and television personality who reviewed Alinea in his book Medium Raw.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM RAW<|>EVENT<|>Medium Raw is a book by Anthony Bourdain that includes a review of Alinea, discussing its culinary experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EL BULLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>El Bulli was a famous restaurant in Spain known for its innovative cuisine, which has since closed.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRANT ACHATZ<|>ALINEA<|>Grant Achatz is the chef and co-owner of Alinea, responsible for its unique dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTHONY BOURDAIN<|>ALINEA<|>Anthony Bourdain reviewed Alinea in his book Medium Raw, highlighting its culinary experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>EL BULLI<|>Alinea is compared to El Bulli, as both are known for their avant-garde cooking styles.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
