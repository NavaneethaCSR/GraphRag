I was just way too excited for my own good about going to this place. Well, believe it or not, this place met, no EXCEEDED, my expectations. How is that even possible? No clue. I mean I really love sausage more than the average person (I blame my German heritage for that) but these are the best sausages I have ever had. When I went I ordered the Ribeye Steak Sausage with Chimichurri, Crispy Fried Onions and Carrigaline Farmhouse Cheese and I ordered this Portuguese linguica sausage with some kind of smoky cheese on top. The ribeye steak sausage was very good but the Portuguese linguica sausage. OH. MY. GOD. I need a new paragraph just to describe this sausage. I'm not sure if it was the sausage itself that was so good or the combination of it with that smoky cheese but this was seriously the best encased meat meal I have ever experienced. I dream of this sausage. And Hot Doug's has now become my benchmark for all things sausage-related. I also tried the duck fat fries and thought they tasted like nothing special. Someone I was with bought the normal fries so we could compare and, yes, you can taste a difference but nothing substantial. I would recommend just getting sausages and no fries. Save room for the good stuff! As far as the wait goes, we got there at 10:45am on a Friday and only had to wait about a 10 minutes wait which I know is unusual. I've driven by this place on the weekend and seen the line stretch for blocks. I can't wait to go back - these sausages are worth a 2 hour wait in the Chicago winter.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
