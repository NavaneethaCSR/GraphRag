i believe i am the same age as the chef and even older than the wait staff. while my husband and i feel blessed to be youthful looking, we are tired of being treated like we don't know our fancy dinner shit just because we look young. when we walked in the door the two ladies took my coat, whispered to each other and then put us in the kiddie room. booo door ladies! i would have given them 4 stars, but this action is a no no in customer service. and it's a shame, because it took me a while to get over this and this paragraph is longer than the one that described the food! if you have the money, go for it, but if you don't have gray hair and are naturally young looking because you inherited great genes, be prepared to feel insulted by the door ladies.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELEVEN MADISON PARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eleven Madison Park is a renowned fine dining restaurant located in New York City, known for its innovative cuisine and exceptional service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The French Laundry is a prestigious restaurant in Yountville, California, celebrated for its exquisite French cuisine and high-quality dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant in Chicago, famous for its creative and avant-garde dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNTVILLE<|>GEO<|>Yountville is a small town in Napa Valley, California, known for its fine dining establishments, including The French Laundry.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NYC<|>GEO<|>New York City, often referred to as NYC, is a major city in the United States known for its cultural diversity and culinary scene.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUSBAND<|>PERSON<|>The husband of the narrator, who shares the dining experience and opinions about the restaurants visited.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIDDIE ROOM<|>LOCATION<|>A specific area in the restaurant where the narrator and her husband were seated, perceived as inappropriate for their dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMELO POWDER<|>EVENT<|>A unique culinary element mentioned in the dining experience that contributed to the overall meal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUFFLE EXPLOSION<|>EVENT<|>A notable dish or culinary experience mentioned that highlights the creativity of the restaurant's offerings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT/COLD POTATO<|>EVENT<|>A dish mentioned in the review that showcases the innovative approach to food at the restaurant.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUSBAND<|>ALINEA<|>The husband accompanied the narrator to Alinea, sharing the dining experience together.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>ELEVEN MADISON PARK<|>Alinea is ranked third in the narrator's list of fancy dining experiences, following Eleven Madison Park and The French Laundry.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>Alinea is ranked third in the narrator's list of fancy dining experiences, following The French Laundry.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>KIDDIE ROOM<|>The narrator and her husband were seated in the kiddie room at Alinea, which negatively impacted their experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNTVILLE<|>FRENCH LAUNDRY<|>The French Laundry is located in Yountville, making the town known for its fine dining.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NYC<|>ELEVEN MADISON PARK<|>Eleven Madison Park is located in NYC, contributing to the city's reputation for high-end dining.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
