It's a staple in Chicago and an institution in the hot dog realm. Los Angeles has their Pink's, New York has Crif Dogs, and Chicago has Hot Doug's. Alligator, ostrich, duck... I heard about the wild flavors at Hot Doug's but never did I imagine they would have rattlesnake! I'm not so adventurous that I would order the rattlesnake on my own but my friend did along with the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. Talk about rich, sinful, and out of this world snack food. The texture of the rattlesnake meat was very soft. Good thing it had the casing to keep it all together. The foie gras hot dog was heavy. I couldn't imagine one person eating it all by him/herself. It's best cut up and distributed amongst the table. The foie gras on top was shaped in coin slivers. The heat of the hot dog did begin to melt it and only then did the hot dog really come together. The Fleur de Sel helped bring out the flavors. These two hot dogs were not my favorite but in terms of something different and a bang for your buck, these were it. A high end restaurant could do these hot dogs and charge an arm and a leg for them. I had the brown ale chipotle buffalo sausage, bacon garlic mayo and carragaline farmhouse cheese dog. It was great. Lots of the hot dogs come with some sort of mustard infused sauce. I am not a mustard fan but the sauces are really good and I do like the variety of cheeses they use. They definitely don't skimp on their ingredients. For classics sake, we got a Dave Pound (corndog) and a Classic Chicago dog. What a deal. For about $2 you can indulge in what I call nostalgic bliss and a piece of Chicago. The Chicago dog comes with whichever toppings you want- tomatoes, pickles, mustard, etc. Good luck stuffing it in your mouth. We also got the weekend duck fat fries. I wasn't too impressed with them. They were just regular fries but one serving is plenty for four people. We actually got two fries. Too much but best believe we packed all that food away. Guilty pleasures! Hot Doug's is a fun stop in the suburbs of Chicago. The line is knee deep. We got there half an hour before they were open and were in the first batch but any later and you could be waiting 2 hours or so. The people come in droves. The jackalope head on the wall is kitschy and oh what a burn to celebrities their hot dog names are. Hot Doug's names their hot dogs after celebrities but once the 15 minutes of fame is up the dogs are renamed. Hot dogs may be referred to as \"formerly Anna Kendrick\" but Hot Doug's is forever. There is only one Hot Doug's.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a city known for its famous hot dogs and culinary culture.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a well-known hot dog restaurant in Chicago, famous for its unique and gourmet hot dog offerings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOS ANGELES<|>GEO<|>Los Angeles is a city known for its own iconic hot dog establishment, Pink's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK<|>GEO<|>New York is a city known for its hot dog vendor, Crif Dogs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RATTLESNAKE<|>EVENT<|>Rattlesnake is a unique hot dog flavor offered at Hot Doug's, showcasing adventurous culinary options.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIE GRAS<|>EVENT<|>Foie Gras is a rich ingredient used in some hot dog offerings at Hot Doug's, contributing to their gourmet appeal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Duck fat fries are a side dish offered at Hot Doug's, known for their indulgent flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVE POUND<|>EVENT<|>Dave Pound is a corndog offered at Hot Doug's, representing a classic hot dog experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLASSIC CHICAGO DOG<|>EVENT<|>The Classic Chicago dog is a traditional hot dog served with various toppings, embodying the city's culinary heritage.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACKALOPE HEAD<|>LOCATION<|>The jackalope head is a decorative feature at Hot Doug's, adding to its quirky atmosphere.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELEBRITIES<|>PERSON<|>Hot Doug's names its hot dogs after celebrities, creating a playful connection to pop culture.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO<|>Hot Doug's is a prominent hot dog restaurant located in Chicago, contributing to the city's culinary reputation.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>LOS ANGELES<|>Hot Doug's is compared to Pink's in Los Angeles, highlighting different regional hot dog cultures.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>NEW YORK<|>Hot Doug's is mentioned alongside Crif Dogs in New York, showcasing the competitive hot dog scene in major cities.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RATTLESNAKE<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Rattlesnake is one of the adventurous hot dog flavors offered at Hot Doug's, emphasizing its unique menu.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOIE GRAS<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Foie Gras is a gourmet ingredient used in Hot Doug's hot dogs, enhancing their luxurious appeal.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Duck fat fries are a popular side dish at Hot Doug's, complementing their hot dog offerings.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVE POUND<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Dave Pound is a classic corndog served at Hot Doug's, representing traditional American fare.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLASSIC CHICAGO DOG<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The Classic Chicago dog is a staple item on Hot Doug's menu, reflecting the city's hot dog culture.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACKALOPE HEAD<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>The jackalope head is a quirky decoration at Hot Doug's, contributing to its unique dining experience.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELEBRITIES<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Hot Doug's names its hot dogs after celebrities, creating a fun and engaging theme for customers.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
