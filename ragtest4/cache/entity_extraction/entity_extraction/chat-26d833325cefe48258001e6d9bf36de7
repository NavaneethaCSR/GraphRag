If I lived in Chicago, I'd come here all of the time. I had the standard \"dog\" grilled - which is so delicious grilled. And so cheap! Under $2. I also couldn't help myself and ordered the foie gras dog, which melted in my mouth and was yummy beyond belief. The two boys I was with were overjoyed by this place and ate a ton of sausages. Make sure you look up the daily \"specials\" menu and snag one of those. Fries were delicious too although I was sad they weren't rendered in duck fat like I had heard. Turns out this is only done on the weekends. In addition to true deliciousness, Doug actually is the person who takes your order. He does it pleasantly, is super kind, and doesn't try to oversell you. For the three of us, he advised only one order of fries. THANK YOU! Two would have been way too many. He also encouraged us to walk around the corner to the outside garden area, which was super cute. We had our food delivered right to the table. Don't be turned off by the long line wrapping around the corner. It moves quickly and regardless, this place is well worth the wait. Doug - please bring your deliciousness to other US cities ASAP!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
