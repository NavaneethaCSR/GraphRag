Yes I am not a food expert but I trust my taste-buds and no they are not happy at all after eating at Alinea. All of us hated it. Great service and presentation but zero in taste, flavor and satisfaction. None of us will ever eat this stupid food (not sure if I even want to call it food) again, even if we are paid to eat it. I drank like 6 - 7 glasses of water/beverage to shove it down, thinking after every course that may be next would be better or may be just the final dessert would be better but no it also was tasteless, bitter. After tolerating the first 7 or 8 courses we started fearing what may come next and Alinea kept on delivering bad tasting dishes one after another. Most dishes were extremely salty and tasted like I am eating some pain relieving cream like Bengay. When the chef came to our table to put together the dessert he didn't look happy or excited at all but rather looked angry and not-interested. I guess that was planned to convey some kind of experience of shock or something when he just dropped the big ball of chocolate and frozen ice cream on our table and just walked away without saying anything, but I didn't like it one bit and rather felt it was stupid and rude. I would rather like the usual when the chef laughs and asks how was the food. Please save your hard earned money. Sandwich from my neighborhood Potbelly is better than this. If you really have money to burn then you are better off by simply donating that money or may be book a flight to see beautiful San Francisco and make a reservation to eat some real good food at \"Gary Danko\" instead of this junk. So much disappointed that we cancelled all of the next reservations, for second group of friends to follow after a few days. I fully understand and highly appreciate the amount of effort and dedication that goes in producing such a complex meal. Yes this is a new kind of experience and all, but still I want to have an experience where I at least like the taste of the food but unfortunately there is nothing here that I can say good about. Experiences like this make me wish I could give negative stars.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences, but it received a negative review for its food quality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARY DANKO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gary Danko is a renowned restaurant in San Francisco known for its high-quality food and dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>GEO<|>San Francisco is a city in California known for its diverse culinary scene and beautiful landscapes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BENGAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bengay is a topical analgesic cream, referenced here to describe the unpleasant taste of the food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The level of service provided at Alinea, which was rated positively despite the food quality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESENTATION<|>EVENT<|>The visual presentation of the dishes at Alinea, which was rated positively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASTE AND FLAVOR<|>EVENT<|>The overall taste and flavor of the food at Alinea, which was rated negatively.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCELLED RESERVATIONS<|>EVENT<|>The decision to cancel future reservations at Alinea due to dissatisfaction with the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEF<|>PERSON<|>The chef at Alinea who presented the dessert but appeared unhappy and uninterested.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>GARY DANKO<|>Gary Danko is suggested as a better alternative to Alinea for a quality dining experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SAN FRANCISCO<|>Alinea is compared to dining experiences available in San Francisco, highlighting the city's culinary reputation.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SERVICE<|>The service at Alinea was rated positively, contrasting with the negative food experience.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>PRESENTATION<|>The presentation of dishes at Alinea was rated positively, despite the negative review of taste.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>TASTE AND FLAVOR<|>The taste and flavor of the food at Alinea were rated negatively, leading to overall dissatisfaction.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>CANCELLED RESERVATIONS<|>The negative dining experience at Alinea led to the cancellation of future reservations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEF<|>ALINEA<|>The chef at Alinea was involved in the presentation of the dessert, which was perceived negatively by the reviewer.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
