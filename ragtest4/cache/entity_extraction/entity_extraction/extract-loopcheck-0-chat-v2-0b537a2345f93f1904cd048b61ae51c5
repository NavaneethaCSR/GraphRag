The restaurant is an extraordinary experience, yet I can't give it 5 stars. I waited a couple of weeks before writing because I wanted to be sure of my impressions. Fyi - we had the twelve-course meal. What I didn't like so much: fishy-greasy smell when we walked in. And overall, several preparations were too salty for my taste. I was ready to love everything. But as the evening progressed, I didn't have that blissful \"yum - bring it on\" feeling. There were too many fried onion slivers as well. And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter. Hmm, dangerous food; interesting. What I liked: attentive service; comfy chairs (important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal). The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve. Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces. Beautiful presentations (the people at the table next to us were snapping photos). A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages. Considering the complexity of the food, it's too bad that saltiness stands out for me. Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun (I skipped the onions). The dishes were beautiful works of modern art. So I'm wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost? Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray? I'm glad I went to Alinea. I'll always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family. If I'm looking for purely delicious though, I'll choose Tru or Trotters.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its extraordinary dining experiences and innovative presentations of food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tru is another restaurant mentioned as a comparison for purely delicious food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TROTTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trotters is another restaurant mentioned as a comparison for purely delicious food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>The family of the reviewer who enjoyed the meal at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWELVE-COURSE MEAL<|>EVENT<|>Alinea's twelve-course meal that the reviewer experienced during their visit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The attentive service provided during the dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRESENTATIONS<|>EVENT<|>The beautiful presentations of the dishes served at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>EVENT<|>The wine pairing that complemented the food during the meal at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISH<|>EVENT<|>A specific dish served at Alinea that had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Rhubarb DISH<|>EVENT<|>A new dish based on rhubarb that was described as gloriously pinky-red.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMFY CHAIRS<|>LOCATION<|>The comfortable chairs at Alinea that contributed to the enjoyable dining experience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMILY<|>ALINEA<|>The reviewer's family enjoyed a unique dining experience at Alinea together.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TWELVE-COURSE MEAL<|>ALINEA<|>The twelve-course meal was a significant part of the dining experience at Alinea.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE<|>ALINEA<|>The attentive service was a highlight of the dining experience at Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRESENTATIONS<|>ALINEA<|>The beautiful presentations of dishes were a memorable aspect of the meal at Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>ALINEA<|>The wine pairing enhanced the dining experience at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISH<|>ALINEA<|>The dish with the melted butter ball was a notable part of the meal at Alinea.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Rhubarb DISH<|>ALINEA<|>The rhubarb dish was a unique offering during the meal at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMFY CHAIRS<|>ALINEA<|>The comfy chairs contributed to the overall enjoyment of the meal at Alinea.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRU<|>ALINEA<|>Tru is mentioned as a comparison for purely delicious food in relation to Alinea.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TROTTERS<|>ALINEA<|>Trotters is mentioned as a comparison for purely delicious food in relation to Alinea.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
