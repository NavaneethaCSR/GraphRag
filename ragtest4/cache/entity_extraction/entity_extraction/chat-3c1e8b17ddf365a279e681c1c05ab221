We waited in line for nearly an hour out in the freeeeezing cold. Despite having two pairs of ski socks on, my toes were frozen and numb by the time we got inside. The wait was definitely worth it though. They have a really extensive and innovative menu of sausages that all sounded great. I ended up getting the mandarin orange and teriyaki chicken sausage, which was delish. We also shared an order of the duck fat fries (only served on the weekends) which were heavenly. Also, apparently the restaurant's eponym, Doug, was the person taking orders at the register. He was really friendly and it's great to see that he's working upfront and interacting with the patrons.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
