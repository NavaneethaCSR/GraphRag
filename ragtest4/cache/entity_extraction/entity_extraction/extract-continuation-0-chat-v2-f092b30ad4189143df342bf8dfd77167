Taste-wise, the food did not completely blow me away. There were definitely some outstanding dishes but there were more \"okay\" dishes than I would have liked. However, I really think it is more a matter of personal preference of the foods served. I have to give props to those who manage to do the Tour. I had the Tasting, and I was pretty stuffed at course 10-11. I was kind of hoping the food would stop coming. The wine pairing is recommended if you can handle your drinks. Ladies be careful. That port at the end is STRONG, and they definitely give you more than what you'd get if you ordered port at other restaurants. The sommelier is knowledgeable but if he were lying to us, we wouldn't have known the difference anyway. None of us are that well-versed in wines nor are we very knowledgeable about the small towns in some European country of which the vineyards are located. The service is great. If someone sees you leaving your chair, they rush over to help you out. They lead you straight to the hallway to the restroom and open the door for you. Your drink (if it's not wine) is constantly being refilled. The waitstaff will even joke with you! As far as the food goes, it's a hit and miss. My favorites, though, were the curry pork belly spring roll and the hot potato/cold potato. I'm not even a fan of truffle, but my goodness, that dish was savory. The creativity that goes into the dishes were amazing. If you had not told me what I was eating, I would probably never figure it out except for maybe a few ingredients. I love how they use scents to further the eating experience. Overall, the meal was definitely an experience, and something to try once, but I don't think I would come here a second time.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A restaurant that offers a unique dining experience with a focus on creativity and presentation of food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASTING<|>EVENT<|>A dining event where multiple courses are served, allowing guests to sample various dishes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>EVENT<|>An event where specific wines are paired with the dishes served to enhance the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOMMELIER<|>PERSON<|>A knowledgeable wine steward who assists guests with wine selections and pairings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRY PORK BELLY SPRING ROLL<|>LOCATION<|>A specific dish that was highlighted as a favorite during the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT POTATO/COLD POTATO<|>LOCATION<|>A specific dish that was highlighted as a favorite during the dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUFFLE<|>LOCATION<|>An ingredient used in one of the dishes that was noted for its savory flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALLWAY<|>LOCATION<|>The area leading to the restroom that the waitstaff guides guests through.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTROOM<|>LOCATION<|>The facility that guests are directed to by the waitstaff.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>TASTING<|>The restaurant hosts a tasting event where multiple courses are served to guests.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>WINE PAIRING<|>The restaurant offers wine pairing as part of the dining experience to complement the food.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOMMELIER<|>RESTAURANT<|>The sommelier works at the restaurant to provide wine recommendations to guests.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CURRY PORK BELLY SPRING ROLL<|>RESTAURANT<|>The curry pork belly spring roll is a dish served at the restaurant that was particularly enjoyed.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT POTATO/COLD POTATO<|>RESTAURANT<|>The hot potato/cold potato dish is a favorite served at the restaurant.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUFFLE<|>RESTAURANT<|>Truffle is an ingredient used in a dish at the restaurant that contributed to its savory flavor.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>HALLWAY<|>The restaurant has a hallway that leads to the restroom, where guests are assisted by the waitstaff.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HALLWAY<|>RESTROOM<|>The hallway leads to the restroom, which guests are directed to by the waitstaff.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
