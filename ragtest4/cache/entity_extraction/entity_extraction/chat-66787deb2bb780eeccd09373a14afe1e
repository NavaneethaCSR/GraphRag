All the \"best meals of my life\"s and culinary discourses. But, looking at the price tag and the difficulty in acquiring a table, you may still be asking yourself, \"Yeah...but is this just hype or is it Really Worth it?\" Let me answer that- IT IS. I could tell how every bite of every course was one of the best, most interesting, most surprising things I have ever eaten and how it has changed how I experience food and dining. I could tell you that the wine pairings were spectacular and pushed each course to yet another level. I could tell you that I was a little starstruck by Grant Achatz and wished I'd snuck in a photo of him creating the final course tableside for people close to us (if I hadn't being playing it \"I totally belong here\" cool and trying to keep the delivery of that course a surprise). I could also tell you that the service was formal but personable enough that when we had a 'hands free\" course that I was comfy enough to raise mine up ala on a rollercoaster or \"look, ma! no hands!\". I could tell you all of those things....but the fact that I was, mid-dinner, scheming how I could save up to come again, soon, may be all you need to hear from me.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
