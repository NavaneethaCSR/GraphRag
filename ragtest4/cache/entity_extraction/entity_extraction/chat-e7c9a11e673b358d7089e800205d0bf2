While the food was generally good it was the experience that could not be beaten. There were genuine moments that I was astonished that vegetables or fruit or whatever could be transformed into something else yet retain the original flavor, however, the reason I've giving four stars is because I felt that too many of the dishes were \"foamed\" or \"freeze dried\" or \"jellied\" We didn't opt for the wine parings, but had the occasional glass of wine. I did have a great time, and it was so much fun anticipating what the next dish would contain. There were some dishes that I thought were amazing, like the hot potato cold potato, then there were some dishes that were not such as Tomato, as I was not a fan of the freeze dried mozzarella. However, we left completely stuffed and generally had a great experience. The staff was awesome, so knowledgeable and helpful. 4 hours later the final bill including tip came to just under $800, and was definitely worth it.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
