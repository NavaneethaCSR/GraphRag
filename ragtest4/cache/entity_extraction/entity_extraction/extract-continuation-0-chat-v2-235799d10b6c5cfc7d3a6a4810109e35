My husband surprised me with dinner at Alinea for my birthday, and it epitomized a luxurious dining experience in every way. Alinea knows what its doing, from top to tippy toes. Instead of deconstructing every aspect of my superb meal, I present the highlights: - attention to detail, from a new linen napkin every time you get up to visit the restroom, to the valet who found us free parking across the street - a vegetarian meal that substituted ingredients to create food that never compromised on flavor, AND produced results identical to what everyone else was eating - personalized souvenier menus - courses that focused on all the senses - especially sight, taste, and smell (the sweet smell of cedar, the nutmeg air - infused pillow) Every part of our food was surprising and beautiful, but I do think Alinea does better on savory courses than sweet. Only because these are the memories that linger. Special standouts were the one bite courses. I could never imagine that such a burst of complementary flavors could come through in a single mouthful. Whatever you need to do to have a meal here - clean out your bank account, take out a second mortgage - do it.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its luxurious and innovative dining experiences, focusing on attention to detail and sensory engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUSBAND<|>PERSON<|>The husband of the narrator who surprised her with a birthday dinner at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>EVENT<|>The occasion for which the narrator was treated to a special dinner at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINNER<|>EVENT<|>The meal experience at Alinea that epitomized luxury and attention to detail.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUSBAND<|>ALINEA<|>The husband surprised the narrator with a birthday dinner at Alinea, highlighting the restaurant's significance in their celebration.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>DINNER<|>The dinner at Alinea was a celebration of the narrator's birthday, making it a special event.<|>9)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
