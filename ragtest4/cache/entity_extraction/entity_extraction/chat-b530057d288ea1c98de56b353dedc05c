Luckily my hubs surprised me for my 30th birthday! It was everything I thought it would be and it was SO worth the wait. Every single dish was a full experience that transformed you into a specific feeling or moment (I presume this is why Next has been so successful as well!!). I loved the full sensory experience the the amount of fine detail in each dish is just crazy. Highlights: Green Curry Tuna - tuna with green curry foam, lemongrass ice, and a salty cream (they described as a taste of ocean) served in a fishbowl! It literally transformed me to a delicious refreshing Thai beachside (and I was just in Thailand earlier this year!) Morels served on river rocks with delicious accoutrements - date compote type thing, quail egg, asparagus, ramps, and more....took me to an amazing forest that tasted delicious and earthy Hot Potato/Cold Potato - He's so famous for this dish and there just aren't words for the overwhelming sensations of hot cold, rich, smooth etcetcetc sensations. I think the brilliance is it leaves you wanting sooo much more! Truffle Ravioli - How did he come up with filling a ravioli with liquid! the truffle and parmesan are such an amazing compliement. Again, another one bite that leaves you wanting. And there were many many more! I can't hold my liquor but my husband got the pairings and I got sips so I could get a small taste. It was absolute perfection the way their paired the wines with each dish. Light and crisp when needed, rich and complex when needed. So perfect. I don't know if I'll ever be back but wow was it amazing. Now to try to get those NEXT tickets!!!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
