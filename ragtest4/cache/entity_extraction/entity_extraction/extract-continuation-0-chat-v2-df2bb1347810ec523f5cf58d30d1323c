That's basically my summed-up experience. One thing I will say, is that half the fun is the surprise element of the food, so reading all the reviews is not the best idea. I did it- because I wanted to know what that price tag was going towards- but it definitely took away from the experience and if there's one thing I'd recommend is STOP READING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FOOD. and STOP LOOKING AT THE PICTURES! STOP! RIGHT NOW!! For that much money, I expect the things I eat to be REALLY DELICIOUS. Not just \"good, and cool presentation!\" but REALLY DELICIOUS. Overall I would say maybe 3 courses I would say that, the rest were... pretty good. Like I said, I expected more. Also, I made the reservation for a special occasion (first wedding anniversary) but nobody asked me if there was an occasion when I made the reservation. Most nice places do- even a Morton's will ask you, and then print \"happy anniversary!\" on your menu. Nothing here. Like I said, I expected more. GT Fish and Oyster wished my husband a happy birthday when we arrived, and when we were seated, and then gave him a birthday gift before we left. THAT is service. Alinea could learn a thing or two. However as far as service goes, I was pretty pleased. I didn't have any of the issues I saw other people comment on. My husband and I don't drink, and nobody pressured us to order something we didn't want. We did several of the house sodas which were tasty. The bottom line is that it really is an event to dine here- my husband liked it way more than I did- partly, I think, because he hadn't read all the info on the courses and was genuinely impressed by what came out. I thought it was all pretty good. A couple of courses (everyone mentions the same ones, for good reason) were amazing, and the rest- pretty good. I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad we tried it once. **Side note: funniest part of the night was when one of our courses that comes... well, sort of balanced on other stuff, slipped off onto the table. The servers all froze, and I swear, the guy who dropped the stuff looked like he was going to go do hara kiri in the kitchen in the back. I think I laughed and said something like \"man overboard!\" because I was trying to ease the tension but I don't think it worked. Poor guy.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences and unique presentation of food.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GT FISH AND OYSTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GT Fish and Oyster is a restaurant that provided excellent service by acknowledging special occasions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUSBAND<|>PERSON<|>The husband of the reviewer who celebrated a special occasion at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY<|>EVENT<|>The special occasion for which the reservation was made at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The overall experience of dining at Alinea, including the quality of service received.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESERVATION<|>EVENT<|>The act of booking a table at Alinea for a special occasion.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COURSES<|>EVENT<|>The various dishes served during the dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPECIAL OCCASION<|>EVENT<|>The reason for the reservation at Alinea, which was the first wedding anniversary.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SURPRISE ELEMENT<|>EVENT<|>The aspect of dining at Alinea that adds excitement and enjoyment to the experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The quality of service provided during the dining experience at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUSBAND<|>FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY<|>The husband was part of the celebration for the first wedding anniversary at Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY<|>The reservation at Alinea was made to celebrate the first wedding anniversary.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GT FISH AND OYSTER<|>HUSBAND<|>GT Fish and Oyster provided a birthday acknowledgment for the husband, showcasing their service quality.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SERVICE<|>The service at Alinea was compared to that of GT Fish and Oyster, highlighting differences in customer experience.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>COURSES<|>The courses served at Alinea were a significant part of the dining experience, impacting the reviewer's satisfaction.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SURPRISE ELEMENT<|>The surprise element of the food at Alinea was emphasized as a key part of the dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESERVATION<|>FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY<|>The reservation was specifically made for the first wedding anniversary celebration.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE<|>COURSES<|>The quality of service impacted the reviewer's experience of the courses served at Alinea.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
