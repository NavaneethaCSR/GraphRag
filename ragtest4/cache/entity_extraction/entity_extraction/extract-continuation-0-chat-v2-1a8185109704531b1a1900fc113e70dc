I want to add that you cannot compare the expense to prior dining experiences, but rather to some other entertainment, or even travel. Here's a scenario: you get a couple choice tickets to the theater, orchestra, Hawks game, whatever ($200?), have a reasonably priced meal with wine for two before or after ($150?). There. You're about at the price for two for Alinea, and since Alinea dining averages four hours, you've spent the same amount of time either night. Compare the price to that, not to that of your (current) favorite restaurant. And I'm willing to bet that Alinea would be the one of the two options above that you remember for the rest of your life. It's definitely more out of this world. My wife and I do not have money fights. She's a teacher, I'm a community college mid-level administrator. We made it work to come here, twice, by not dining out for a few weeks in a row and giving up booze each time, which is not exactly a sacrifice in order to afford something for which there exists simply no other comparable or approximate experience. Alinea is not another restaurant - it's its own type of satisfaction. A digressing note to any Alinea employee potentially reading this. Off the bat, you all do perfect work, thank you for doing so much to really enhance the first and second best dining experiences I've ever had. I admire your memory capabilities, agility juggling dishes and superlative commitment to service. It is in the most constructive vein that I suggest you stop the practice of pretending to remember - to the very date even -- the last time a customer dined at your restaurant. It's at best cute when you open a food explanation with a pseudo-spontaneous \"I believe when you were here last April, the 12th was it, when you had the...\" Especially when you did not serve us last time. Maybe some CRM research shows other diners think you really remembered them and appreciate the fleeting specialness, but I doubt it. And nothing else you do is transparent.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a renowned restaurant in Chicago, celebrated for its unique dining experiences and high-quality service.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in the United States known for its vibrant food scene, including Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIFE<|>PERSON<|>The wife of the narrator, who is a teacher and shares dining experiences with the narrator.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The narrator is a community college mid-level administrator who discusses dining experiences at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THEATER<|>LOCATION<|>A venue for live performances, mentioned as a comparison for the cost of dining at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORCHESTRA<|>LOCATION<|>A musical ensemble that performs in concert halls, mentioned as a comparison for the cost of dining at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAWKS GAME<|>EVENT<|>A sporting event involving the Chicago Hawks, mentioned as a comparison for the cost of dining at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>EVENT<|>The act of dining at Alinea, which is described as a unique and memorable experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>The quality of service provided by Alinea staff, which is praised by the narrator.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRM RESEARCH<|>EVENT<|>Customer Relationship Management research mentioned in the context of Alinea's service practices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>WIFE<|>The narrator and his wife share dining experiences and financial decisions regarding their visits to Alinea.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>CHICAGO<|>Alinea is located in Chicago, contributing to the city's reputation for excellent dining options.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>ALINEA<|>The narrator has dined at Alinea multiple times and appreciates the unique experience it offers.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIFE<|>ALINEA<|>The wife of the narrator has also dined at Alinea, sharing the experience with the narrator.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DINING EXPERIENCE<|>ALINEA<|>Dining at Alinea is described as a unique and memorable experience, distinct from other dining options.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE<|>ALINEA<|>The service at Alinea is praised by the narrator, highlighting the restaurant's commitment to quality.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THEATER<|>ALINEA<|>The cost of dining at Alinea is compared to attending a theater performance, indicating a similar level of expense.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORCHESTRA<|>ALINEA<|>The cost of dining at Alinea is compared to attending an orchestra performance, indicating a similar level of expense.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAWKS GAME<|>ALINEA<|>The cost of dining at Alinea is compared to attending a Hawks game, indicating a similar level of expense.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRM RESEARCH<|>ALINEA<|>The narrator references CRM research in relation to Alinea's service practices, suggesting a connection to customer experience.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
