One of my favorite places. The specialty dogs are a bit pricey, but it makes sense why. The Portuguese Linguisa with Iberico cheese was probably my favorite, but I haven't had one I didn't like. I think I have tried 7 different specials now, along with a Chicago style dog and a polish. Everything was excellent. The regular dogs and sausages are priced normally. If you are able to, call your order in and go pick it up. There is a minimum (I think it was $25 and it's cash only) for a pick up order but it's worth it and it's easily met with 2 people. I only say this because it is has been slammed each time I've been there. When I went in to pick up my order, the person taking money and orders (I think it was Doug) was very friendly and cordial. It's nice to see when people are busy they can actually be friendly still.
