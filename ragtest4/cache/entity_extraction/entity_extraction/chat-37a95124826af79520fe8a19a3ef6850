I guess if you're going to a gourmet hot dog joint you should really push the limits. I had some kind of boar sausage and the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. When I did Burning Man a few years back someone had some wild boar sausage and it was unfingbelievable. The boar at Doug's was pretty good but not what I remembered. Of course it wasn't 110 degrees, I wasn't surrounded by naked women and starving... The Duck Sausage was another thing entirely. Ok this thing is probably about the richest thing I've ever eaten. Rich upon rich upon rich. This was a few months ago but from what I remember it was absolutely indulgently delicious. The sauce on the dog had little crunchy bits that were awesome. The only problem was the dog, sauce and bun were all pretty much the same texture. And it's all so rich that the taste blends together. But I've never had anything like it and it made the whole Hot Dougs experience memorable. If and when I go back I will have that addictive concoction again.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
