My boy and I stood outside in the freezing Chicago weather (the day before the temperature jumped up to the 70s) for about 40 minutes. We braved the line that bizarrely snaked around the shady (freezing) side of the building. We waited in the first lobby by the entrance. We waited in the second inner lobby. We waited in the line to the cash register to order, and by god, did Doug seem like a heavenly avatar of bounteous sausages by the time we reached him! We split one order of duck fat fries and four sausages between us: the foie gras dog, the weekly game special which was wild boar w/ marsala, the brigitte bardot (andouille) which was not spicy enough, but still a classic, and linguica. I could not stop moaning from actual food-induced pleasure. I don't know whether this level of happiness was induced solely by the food. After all, I was finally inside the warm cozy restaurant. I was also finally eating after the 5 hour flight, 2 hour ride to our AirBnB apartment, 7 hours of sleep, half hour of travel and 40 minute wait. Hot damn though, those sausages were fucking amazing. The fries were great, however, the sausages were really the most amazing things I feel like I've ever eaten (in terms of Western food). Hot Doug's is the BEST. Oh my god, and the prices are so reasonable too!!!!\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
