I went today and got there early, around 1030 am, and still waited in a short line. It seemed part of the experience but I'd of waited longer having known what was in store. Doug was behind the counter and took our order. He was polite and actually thanked us for our order. Classy! We saw the Ribeye steak sausage was new today so we ordered one along with an Alsacienne, Italian, Linguica, corn dog, and fries. Everything was outstanding!!!!! Seriously awesome. The Ribeye tasted like steak in tube form and the horseradish sauce on it was perfect. The Linguica with Saffron sauce and Iberico cheese was a flavor punch and very rich. (Recomended by Hot Doug himself when I asked). The Bacon sausage aka Alsacienee was mild and not nearly as rich as I expected even when topped with a mild blue cheese and Creme Fresh....seriously gourmet and perfect. The corn dog was light and delicious too. Hot Doug's fresh cut fries...not the duck fat variety, were some dam good fries. Not greasy, crispy, well seasoned, and very tasty. I can't wait to get me some duck fat fries next time. Eating for the first time at Hot Dougs just makes we want to return again...heck even tomorrow if I could. This place makes me happy to be overweight. No guilt, only goodness. Thank you Doug for the encased meat Mecca experience. If I could buy stock......l would.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Dougs is a gourmet sausage restaurant known for its unique and flavorful encased meats and sides, providing a memorable dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUG<|>PERSON<|>Doug is the owner and operator behind the counter at Hot Dougs, known for his polite service and engagement with customers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIBEYE STEAK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A new menu item at Hot Dougs that offers a unique flavor experience, described as tasting like steak in tube form.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALSACIENNE<|>EVENT<|>A type of sausage offered at Hot Dougs, known for its mild flavor and gourmet toppings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN<|>EVENT<|>A sausage variety available at Hot Dougs, contributing to the diverse menu.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINGUICA<|>EVENT<|>A flavorful sausage option at Hot Dougs, noted for its rich taste and saffron sauce.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORN DOG<|>EVENT<|>A light and delicious item on the menu at Hot Dougs, praised for its quality.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Fresh cut fries served at Hot Dougs, known for being crispy, well-seasoned, and tasty.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>A special type of fries that are anticipated by the customer for their unique flavor, not available during this visit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAPPY<|>VERB<|>The feeling of joy experienced by the customer while dining at Hot Dougs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOUG<|>HOT DOUGS<|>Doug is the owner and operator of Hot Dougs, directly involved in the customer experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIBEYE STEAK SAUSAGE<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The Ribeye steak sausage is a new menu item offered at Hot Dougs, enhancing the restaurant's reputation for gourmet sausages.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALSACIENNE<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The Alsacienne sausage is part of the diverse menu at Hot Dougs, showcasing the restaurant's gourmet offerings.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ITALIAN<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The Italian sausage is another item on the menu at Hot Dougs, contributing to its variety.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINGUICA<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The Linguica sausage is featured on Hot Dougs' menu, known for its rich flavor profile.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORN DOG<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The corn dog is a popular item at Hot Dougs, praised for its quality and taste.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIES<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The fries served at Hot Dougs are noted for their quality, enhancing the overall dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>HOT DOUGS<|>Duck fat fries are a sought-after item at Hot Dougs, indicating the restaurant's commitment to gourmet food.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAPPY<|>HOT DOUGS<|>The customer feels happy while dining at Hot Dougs, reflecting the positive experience provided by the restaurant.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
