Alinea was THE restaurant I've longed to go for some time now. Finally I made it out this past weekend with my friend who was willing to fly all the way to Chicago just to eat at all these wonderful places with me even if she's pregnant! Last year she took me to Manresa (currently one of my favorite restaurants) for my birthday and this year it's Alinea. Yes, I have the best friend in the world that spoils me wayyyyy toooo much! I don't know how I'm going to outbeat this night when it's comes time for her birthday next year. We got there early and they happily seated us to our tables upstairs. I was all smiles because I was so excited. This was the most unique experience I've ever had - one of molecular gastronomy. eehhh?? what is that? It means \"scientific discipline involving the study of physical and chemical processes that occur in cooking\" Every dish was creative and complex. We were impressed with the imagination and the detail that were delivered in each of the 14 courses. Yep, 14 courses. Thank god we didn't do the 22 courses because I felt like my stomach was going to burst at the end of our experience. One must be open to eating anything and everything, and appreciate the flavors to truly enjoy this restaurant. 1. Trout Roe with coconut, hyssop, passinofruit - sweet, spicy, salty 2. Tomato with basil, mozzarella, olive oil - tomatoes came in different forms (hydrogenated, jelly, etc) with a icy foamy mozzarella with cubed balsamic vingear jelly. 3. Cauliflower with five coatings, three gels, apple - this is a seasonal dish. There were 5 custard like cauliflower cubes. Each coated differently (parmasean, almonds, bacon, don't remember the rest). But you really have to use your palate to distinguish each one. 4. Lobster with popcorn, butter, curry - yummy but a little too rich especially if you pop that butter balloon which my friend did =) 5. Wagyu beef from Japan with maitake mushrooms, smoked date and Blis Elixir - this was my favorite. It was so flavorful that it kept me wanting more. 6. ShortRib with Guiness, peanut and friend broccoli - this was a big dish and we were only half way through our menu. 7. Hot potato with cold potato, black truffle and butter chives - it was a generous portion of truffle. This was my friend's favorite dish. 8. Lamb with potato, sunflower, sweet spice - whew, last of the savory dishes 9. Concord grape with yogurt, mint and long pepper - the big ball was in a shot glass which we had to open wide. The big ball cracks in your mouth and oozes out. My friend almost choked on this one. 10. Watermelon with fresh coriander, tamari and bonito 11. Bacon with butterscotch, apple and thyme 12. Pumpkin with gruyere, Blis maple syrup - this was cool. We ate this over a pillow of smoke so it's like your eating a smokey dish. 13. Chocolate with fig, olive and pine - oh boy, we can't eat anymore but we manage to eat it because it's so good. *** Birthday chocolate ball **** 14. Dry caramel with salt - dried flakes of caramel that becomes chewy in your mouth. Finally, we made it through our meal. I didn't even mention the breads which accompanied some of the courses, such as the napa cabbage fennel bread or the oolong tea black sesame seed bagel. We should get a prize for getting through the finish line though we were quite impressed with the couple behind us finishing up a 22 course menu. Alinea also serves a very nice range of teas - one which was a imported 1947 tea that cost $95 for a cup of tea! holy cow! At the moment, Alinea, Manresa and Joel Robuchon (Tokyo - Ebisu Garden location) are tied on my restaurant list. I think if Alinea served less rich dishes it would be the top of my list. We're already talking about our next trip in the near future to El Bulli (Spain) and Fat Duck (UK - I couldn't get a reservation when I was there this past August so next time I have to call exactly 3 months in advance) which both serve molecular gastronomy cuisine. Hopefully we can do New Orleans before that since my sister and her are craving crawfish - hhmm... could just be a pregnancy craving for both of them so we'll see!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a major city in the United States known for its vibrant food scene, including renowned restaurants like Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant in Chicago famous for its innovative molecular gastronomy dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANRESA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Manresa is a highly regarded restaurant known for its exquisite culinary offerings, previously visited by the author.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOEL ROBUCHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Joel Robuchon is a renowned restaurant brand with locations worldwide, including Tokyo, known for its fine dining.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EL BULLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>El Bulli was a famous restaurant in Spain known for its avant-garde cuisine and molecular gastronomy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAT DUCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fat Duck is a Michelin-starred restaurant in the UK known for its creative and experimental culinary techniques.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIEND<|>PERSON<|>The author's friend who accompanied them to Alinea and has a significant role in their dining experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>EVENT<|>The author's birthday celebration, which included a visit to Manresa the previous year.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY<|>EVENT<|>A culinary style that combines science and cooking to create innovative dishes, featured prominently at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>14 COURSES<|>EVENT<|>The dining experience at Alinea consisted of 14 unique and creatively presented courses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW ORLEANS<|>GEO<|>A city in the United States known for its rich culinary traditions, particularly seafood like crawfish.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAWFISH<|>LOCATION<|>A type of seafood that is popular in New Orleans cuisine, mentioned as a craving by the author's sister and friend.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREGNANCY CRAVING<|>EVENT<|>A specific craving experienced by the author's friend and sister during pregnancy, influencing their dining choices.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIEND<|>ALINEA<|>The author's friend accompanied them to Alinea, enhancing the dining experience through shared enjoyment.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIEND<|>MANRESA<|>The author's friend took them to Manresa for their birthday, indicating a close friendship and shared culinary interests.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>MOLECULAR GASTRONOMY<|>Alinea is known for its molecular gastronomy, which defines its unique dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIRTHDAY<|>MANRESA<|>The visit to Manresa was part of the author's birthday celebration, linking the event to a significant personal occasion.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>14 COURSES<|>The dining experience at Alinea included 14 courses, showcasing the restaurant's elaborate menu.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW ORLEANS<|>CRAWFISH<|>New Orleans is known for its crawfish, a popular dish that the author's friend and sister crave.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIEND<|>PREGNANCY CRAVING<|>The author's friend is experiencing pregnancy cravings, influencing their dining preferences and choices.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>JOEL ROBUCHON<|>Both Alinea and Joel Robuchon are tied on the author's restaurant list, indicating a comparison of culinary excellence.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>FAT DUCK<|>The author plans to visit Fat Duck, similar to Alinea, indicating a shared culinary exploration of molecular gastronomy.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>EL BULLI<|>The author expresses interest in visiting El Bulli, linking it to their experience at Alinea and the theme of molecular gastronomy.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
