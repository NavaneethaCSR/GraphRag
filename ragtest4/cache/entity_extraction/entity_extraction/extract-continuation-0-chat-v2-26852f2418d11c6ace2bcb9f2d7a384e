I'm sure Alinea changes their menu from time to time and I can tell you what we had on the evening of January 27th to celebrate our love of food but why ruin the surprise? You get a menu with a list of all the artistic expression of Grant Achatz (head chef) and his team at the end of your meal. If you do the wine paring, which is wonderful, be prepared to shell out the big bucks. The paring will cost you 2/3 of the meal, which might be something to think about.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative dining experiences and artistic culinary expressions led by head chef Grant Achatz.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANT ACHATZ<|>PERSON<|>Grant Achatz is the head chef at Alinea, known for his creative and artistic approach to cuisine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANUARY 27TH<|>EVENT<|>A special evening celebrated at Alinea, highlighting a unique dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNDISCLOSED LOCATION<|>LOCATION<|>Alinea's dining experience is described as taking place at an undisclosed location, adding an element of mystery.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>EVENT<|>A wine pairing option offered at Alinea that enhances the dining experience, though it significantly increases the cost of the meal.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRANT ACHATZ<|>ALINEA<|>Grant Achatz is the head chef at Alinea, responsible for the restaurant's culinary innovations.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JANUARY 27TH<|>ALINEA<|>The evening of January 27th was a special occasion celebrated at Alinea, showcasing its dining experience.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINE PAIRING<|>ALINEA<|>The wine pairing is a significant part of the dining experience at Alinea, enhancing the meal's enjoyment.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
