The meal was interactive and left you constantly waiting for the next one to come out, all the time saying \"I can't wait to see what's next!\" The only \"tip\" I would pass on is definitely get The wine pairing ($160) but unless you are a serious wine enthusiast it's probably not worth upgrading to the reserved wine pairing ($250) as we did. I didn't find many of the reserved wines to be that worth it. Also I've read a lot of negative reviews of the wait staff. I couldn't disagree more. We probably had 7-8 different servers/runners wait on us, and all were fun and made the experience even greater. The highlight being waited on by Chef Achatz himself for the final course.
