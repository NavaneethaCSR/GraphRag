You know you develop the irrational dislikes and likes in regards to what you are willing to expose yourself to? Yeah, do yourself a favor, throw it all away. I have never been one for molecular gastronomy, but going to this restaurant has given me a fresh perspective into believing in the science - or art. When they say 'no course is the same' they really do mean it. The beginning of the night started with the waiter asking me of my likes, dislikes, food allergies, and whatever else I would prefer. They fit every course around what I had specified. The presentation was impeccable - less a dish that you eat, rather a grand presentation that you watch unfold, becomes your dish, and finally you enjoy every bite. One of my dishes was presented, oddly, to me on a pillow - yeah, you heard it, pillow. When I was ready to dive into the dish, the waiter punctured the pillow and off I went. I know smell is directly related to how your food tastes, but it couldn't be more apparent than this. There are quite a few people who are critical of this restaurant and a few more who rave about this restaurant; even if you have read the bad reviews, it's worth a try. It's a meal of a life-time that I plan on having a few more times in this life. Please be on time! A bit of a winter storm was barreling down and they called me 10 minutes prior to my reservation to see if I was showing up or not. They have a 15 minute window in which they will cancel your reservation. The restaurant staff is very direct in enforcing the dress-code through their information they provide on the phone. However, when I was there in person, there was a guy with a t-shirt and shorts. Um, what? I'm letting that slip, the food, experience and environment just are incredible!!\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A restaurant known for its molecular gastronomy, offering a unique dining experience tailored to individual preferences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAITER<|>PERSON<|>The waiter at the restaurant who interacts with guests to customize their dining experience based on likes, dislikes, and allergies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINTER STORM<|>EVENT<|>A weather event that occurred around the time of the reservation, potentially affecting attendance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESERVATION<|>EVENT<|>A scheduled dining experience at the restaurant that requires punctuality to avoid cancellation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRESS-CODE<|>EVENT<|>The set of guidelines enforced by the restaurant regarding appropriate attire for guests.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PILLOW<|>LOCATION<|>An unusual serving method used by the restaurant where a dish is presented on a pillow.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAITER<|>RESTAURANT<|>The waiter is an employee of the restaurant, responsible for serving and customizing the dining experience for guests.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINTER STORM<|>RESERVATION<|>The winter storm impacted the reservation, leading the restaurant to check on the guest's attendance.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRESS-CODE<|>RESTAURANT<|>The restaurant has a dress-code that guests are expected to follow when dining there.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PILLOW<|>RESTAURANT<|>The pillow is a unique presentation method used by the restaurant to enhance the dining experience.<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
