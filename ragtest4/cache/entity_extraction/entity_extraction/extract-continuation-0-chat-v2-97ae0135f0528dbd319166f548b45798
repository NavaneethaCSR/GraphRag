In our case, it was more like 15 courses. By the time we had our last savory course (the bacon hanging on a wire), I was ready to fall asleep/keel over. I would go to Alinea again, but probably opt for no more than two glasses of wine (one red and one white) and stick with the 12-course tasting menu. I've read on other blogs that the 24-course meal has smaller portions, but that didn't appear to be the case when I was there. There were two tables (one party of two and a larger party of six) that were going the \"tour\" and I just marveled at how they could even handle it. I was more impressed with the savory courses than the sweet/dessert courses. The presentation of all the courses was beautiful and surprising (although not too surprising since I read a lot about what to expect from various foodie blogs) and the service was excellent. I honestly could have ended the meal with the palate cleanser (guava). Of the savory courses, the one that left me confused was the lamb course. I think that it should have been named \"English pea\" since this was the predominant ingredient/flavor for me. But do take my comments with a grain of salt, so to speak...I was quite \"toasty\" by the 12th course. Maybe if I weren't so drunk, I'd have a different opinion of the sweet courses. This was definitely the most expensive meal we've ever had ($500+ for two--that's the tasting menu plus wine pairings, tip and tax). We were there for at least 3.5 hours.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALINEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alinea is a Michelin-starred restaurant known for its innovative 12-course tasting menu and wine pairings, providing a unique dining experience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETITE ASIAN FEMALE<|>PERSON<|>A petite Asian female who has been on a weight-loss plan and experienced a 12-course meal at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAVORY COURSES<|>EVENT<|>The savory courses at Alinea are part of the tasting menu that impressed the reviewer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEET COURSES<|>EVENT<|>The sweet courses at Alinea, which the reviewer found less impressive compared to the savory courses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUAVA<|>LOCATION<|>Guava was mentioned as a palate cleanser served during the meal at Alinea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAMB COURSE<|>EVENT<|>The lamb course at Alinea, which left the reviewer confused due to its predominant flavor of English pea.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>24-COURSE MEAL<|>EVENT<|>Alinea's 24-course meal, which is rumored to have smaller portions compared to the 12-course meal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>500+ DOLLARS<|>EVENT<|>The total cost of the meal at Alinea for two people, including the tasting menu, wine pairings, tip, and tax.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3.5 HOURS<|>EVENT<|>The duration of the dining experience at Alinea, which lasted at least 3.5 hours.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETITE ASIAN FEMALE<|>ALINEA<|>The petite Asian female experienced a meal at Alinea, which included a 12-course tasting menu and wine pairings.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SAVORY COURSES<|>The savory courses are part of the dining experience at Alinea that impressed the reviewer.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>SWEET COURSES<|>The sweet courses are also part of the dining experience at Alinea, but the reviewer found them less impressive than the savory courses.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>GUAVA<|>Guava was served as a palate cleanser during the meal at Alinea.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>LAMB COURSE<|>The lamb course is a specific dish served at Alinea that confused the reviewer due to its flavor profile.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>24-COURSE MEAL<|>The 24-course meal is another dining option at Alinea, compared to the 12-course meal experienced by the reviewer.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>500+ DOLLARS<|>The meal at Alinea cost over $500 for two people, indicating its high-end dining experience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALINEA<|>3.5 HOURS<|>The dining experience at Alinea lasted at least 3.5 hours, highlighting the extensive nature of the meal.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
