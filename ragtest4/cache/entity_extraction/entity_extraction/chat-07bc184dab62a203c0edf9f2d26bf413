I had the full tour menu with wine pairings. The service was amazing - they strike the perfect balance between being attentive and trying to meet your every need and expectation without somehow smothering and hovering over you. Although, maybe waiting for me to get out of the bathroom to push in my chair was a bit embarrassing. Especially, since I was sidetracked by the Alinea book on my way out. Also as a note to servers: don't get irritated with a customer because they didn't tell you they don't like X when you specifically ask \"Are you allergic to anything?\" How was I supposed to know you wanted to hear about my recent campaign to stop the disgusting overuse of truffle in, on, and around everything in Chicago? I don't use \"allergies\" as an excuse. So how about asking if I have any dislikes or preferences? Food - to be perfectly honest I was rather disappointed. I was happy I had had the \"Alinea Experience\" but was rather unimpressed with the food. There seemed to be far too much of the same textures (aka mushy squares and gelatin squares). The only dishes I would say were good were the pork belly, the bacon - sweet potato -mustard (served as a threesome) and the desserts. I did also enjoy the cauliflower which I almost hesitate to mention since me liking veggies means the rest or your food must be.... Wine - Oh my goodness. Amazing. What I craved after my dinner at Alinea was to come back for a night of fantastic wine, baskets and baskets of the amazing bread, \"donuts,\" rolls and cheeses as unique as your wine. Now that would be a perfect 5 stars.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 5000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
