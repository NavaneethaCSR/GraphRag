Hot Doug's needs no introduction for those living in Chicago. Even when we arrived at opening time, the wait was at least an hour long during the bitter cold winter. The line can be two hours long during the warmer months. The average of 4 1/2 stars rating with almost two thousands reviews should tell you something. Love the unusual meat selections and flavor combinations. Think pomegranate puree with sheep's milk cheese. Where else can you find snake or alligator sausages in your hot dog? The special menu changes on a regular basis, so don't expect to find that elk sausage the next time. I recommend people to try the foie gras and duck sausage. My only disappointment was the duck fat fries. Not crazy about them without the crunch.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a city known for its fine dining and culinary experiences, particularly famous for its hot dogs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a renowned restaurant in Chicago famous for its unique hot dog offerings and long wait times.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIE GRAS<|>EVENT<|>Foie gras is a delicacy recommended for tasting at Hot Doug's, known for its rich flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>Duck sausage is another specialty offered at Hot Doug's, praised for its unique taste.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>EVENT<|>Duck fat fries are a side dish served at Hot Doug's, noted for being less crunchy than expected.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO<|>Hot Doug's is a prominent dining establishment located in Chicago, contributing to the city's culinary reputation.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOIE GRAS<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Foie gras is a recommended dish at Hot Doug's, highlighting the restaurant's unique menu offerings.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK SAUSAGE<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Duck sausage is a featured item at Hot Doug's, showcasing the restaurant's innovative approach to hot dogs.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT FRIES<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>Duck fat fries are served at Hot Doug's, although they did not meet the diner's expectations for crunchiness.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
