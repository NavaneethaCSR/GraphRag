So so cold. I thought the fact that it was 20 degrees out would make the line shorter, but we still stood there for 45 minutes in the cold cold air. I wondered what kind of encased meats would make people do such a thing, and so I ordered two sausages to find out. First was the classic duck confit pork sausage. It had peach aioli, morbier cheese and truffle oil, and I've never had any of those things before. I'm glad my first time was at Hot Doug's, because everything went together perfectly: the softness of the cheese complemented the snap of the sausage while the truffle oil and peach aioli added just the right amount of earthy sweetness. Probably the best sausage I've ever had. Next was a Chicago Style hot dog, to see how Hot Doug did it. It was presented beautifully, and the flavors were all classic. It felt like there was an extra dash of celery salt and a little something in the mustard or celery that added just a bit of tang to the whole thing. Overall a supremely good hot dog. I can die happy.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot Doug's is a renowned eatery known for its gourmet sausages and hot dogs in Chicago, famous for its unique flavor combinations and quality ingredients.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCK CONFIT PORK SAUSAGE<|>EVENT<|>A specific type of sausage served at Hot Doug's, featuring duck confit and pork, complemented by peach aioli, morbier cheese, and truffle oil.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO STYLE HOT DOG<|>EVENT<|>A classic hot dog prepared in the Chicago style, known for its specific toppings and presentation, served at Hot Doug's.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACH AIOLI<|>LOCATION<|>A sauce made from peaches and used as a condiment for the duck confit pork sausage, enhancing its flavor profile.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORBIER CHEESE<|>LOCATION<|>A type of cheese used in the duck confit pork sausage, known for its creamy texture and distinct flavor.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUFFLE OIL<|>LOCATION<|>An oil infused with truffle flavor, used in the duck confit pork sausage to add an earthy richness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY SALT<|>LOCATION<|>A seasoning used in the Chicago Style hot dog, contributing to its distinctive taste.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSTARD<|>LOCATION<|>A condiment used in the Chicago Style hot dog, adding tanginess to the overall flavor.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>DUCK CONFIT PORK SAUSAGE<|>Hot Doug's serves the duck confit pork sausage, which is a signature dish of the restaurant.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT DOUG'S<|>CHICAGO STYLE HOT DOG<|>Hot Doug's is known for its Chicago Style hot dog, which is a popular menu item.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK CONFIT PORK SAUSAGE<|>PEACH AIOLI<|>Peach aioli is a condiment that enhances the flavor of the duck confit pork sausage.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK CONFIT PORK SAUSAGE<|>MORBIER CHEESE<|>Morbier cheese is an ingredient in the duck confit pork sausage, contributing to its taste.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUCK CONFIT PORK SAUSAGE<|>TRUFFLE OIL<|>Truffle oil is used in the duck confit pork sausage, adding a rich flavor.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO STYLE HOT DOG<|>CELERY SALT<|>Celery salt is a key seasoning in the Chicago Style hot dog, enhancing its traditional flavor.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO STYLE HOT DOG<|>MUSTARD<|>Mustard is a common condiment used in the Chicago Style hot dog, adding tanginess.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
